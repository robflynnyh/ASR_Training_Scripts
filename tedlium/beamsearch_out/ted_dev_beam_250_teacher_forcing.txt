[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3685161)[0m i am my writer writing books is my profession but it's more than that of course it is also my great lifelong love and fascination and i don't expect that that's ever going to change but that said something kind of peculiar has happened recently in my life and in my career which has caused me to have to sort of recalibrate my whole relationship with this work and the peculiar thing is that i recently wrote this book this memoir called a pre love which decidedly unlike any of my previous books went out in the world for some reason and became this big mega sensation international best seller thing the result of which is that everywhere i go now people treat me like i'm doomed seriously doomed they come up to me all worried and they say aren't you afraid aren't you afraid you're never going to be able to top that aren't you afraid you're going to keep writing for your whole life and you're never again going to create a book that anybody in the world cares about at all ever again so that's reassuring you know but it would be worse except for that i happened to remember that over twenty years ago when i first started telling people when i was a teenager that i wanted to be a writer i was met with this same kind of sort of fear based reaction and people would say aren't too afraid you're never going to have any success aren't too afraid the humiliation of rejection will kill you aren't too afraid that you're going to work your whole life at this craft and nothings that are going to come with it you're going to die on a scrap of broken dreams with your mouth filled with bitter ash of failure like that you know and the answer the short answer to all those questions is yes yes i'm afraid of all those things and i always have been and i'm afraid of many many more things besides that you know people can't even guess out like seaweed and other things that are scary but when it comes to writing the thing that i've been sort of thinking about lately and wondering about lately is why you know is it rational is it logical that anybody should be expected to be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this earth to do you know and what is it specifically about creative ventures this seems to make us really nervous about each other's mental health in a way that other careers kind of don't do you know like my dad for example was a chemical engineer i don't recall once in his forty years of chemical engineering anybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer you know it just didn't like that chemical engineering block john you know housical and it just didn't come up like that you know but to be fair right chemical engineers as a group you know haven't really earned a reputation over the centuries for being alcoholic manic depressives and we writers you know we kind of do have that reputation not just writers but creative people across all shores it seems to have this reputation for being enormously mentally unstable and you know all you have to do is look at the very grim death count in the twentieth century alone of really magnificent creative minds who died young and often at their own hands you know and even the ones who didn't literally commit suicide seem to be really undone and by their gifts you know norman mayler just before he died the last interview he said every one of my books has killed me a little more
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3685164)[0m we talked about some of these projects before about the human genome and what that might mean and discovering new sets of genes we're actually starting at a new point we've been digitizing biology and now we're trying to go from that digital code into a new phase of biology with designing and synthesizing life so we've always been trying to ask big questions what is life is something that i think many biologists have been trying to understand at various levels we've tried various approaches paring it down to minimal components we've been digitizing it now for almost twenty years when we sequenced the human genome that was going from the analog world of biology into the digital world of the computer now we're trying to ask can we regenerate life or can we create new life out of this digital universe this is the map of a small organism mycoplasma genitalium that has the smallest genome for a species that can self replicate in the laboratory and we've been trying to just see if we can come up with an even smaller genome we're able to knock out on the order of one hundred genes out of the five hundred or so that are here but when we look at its metabolic map it's relatively simple compared to mars trust me this is simple but when we look at all the genes that we could knock out one at a time it's very unlikely that this would yield a living cell so we decided the only way forward was to actually synthesize this chromosome so we could vary the components to ask some of these most fundamental questions and so we started down the road of can we synthesize a chromosome can chemistry permit making these really large molecules where we've never been before and if we do can we boot up a chromosome the chromosome by the way is just a piece of inner chemical material so our pace of digitizing life has been increasing at an exponential pace our ability to write the genetic code has been moving pretty slowly but has been increasing and our latest point would put it on now on exponential curve we started this over fifteen years ago it took several stages in fact starting with a bioothical review before we did the first experiments but it turns out synthesizing dna is very difficult there's tens of thousands of machines around the world that make small pieces of dna thirty to fifty letters and lengths and it's a degenerate process so the longer would make the piece the more errors there are so we had to create a new method for putting these little pieces together and correct all the errors and this was our first attempt starting with the digital information of the genome of pi x one hundred and seventy four it's a small virus that kills bacteria we designed the pieces and went through our air correction and had a dna molecule of about five thousand letters and the exciting phase when we took this piece of inner chemical and put it in the bacteria and the bacteria started to read this genetic code made the viral particles the viral particles then were released from the cells and came back and killed the e cola i was talking to the oil industry recently and i said they clearly understood that model they left more than you guys all right and so we think this is a situation where the software can actually build its own hardware in a biological system but we wanted to go much larger we wanted to build an entire bacterial chromosome it's over five hundred and eighty thousand letters of genetic code so we thought we'd build them that cassettes the size of the viruses so we could actually vary the cassettes to understand what the actual components of a living cell are design is critical and if you're starting with digital information in the computer that digital information has to be really accurate

[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3685162)[0m you know one of the intense pleasures of travel and one of the delights of ethnographic research is the opportunity to live amongst those who have not forgotten the old ways who still feel their past and the wind touch it in stones polished by rain tasted in the bitter leaves of plants just to know that jaguar shamans still journey beyond the milky way or the the myths of the inuit elders still resonate with meaning or that in the himalaya the buddhist still pursue the breath of the darma is to really remember the central revelation of anthropology and that is the idea that the world in which we live in does not exist in some absolute sense but it's just one model of reality the consequence of one particular set of adapt of choices that our lineage made i'll be it successfully many generations ag and of course we all share the same adaptive imperatives we're all born we all bring our children to the world we go through initiation rights we have to deal with the inexible separation of death so it should't surprise us that we all see we all dance we all have art but what's interesting is the unique cadence of the song the rhythm of the dance in every culture and whether it is the panan in the forests of borneo or the vodo atollites in haiti or the warriors in the kissed desert of northern kenya the quandta in the mountains of the andes or a cut of a city in the middle of the sahara this is incidentally the fellow that i traveled into the desert with a month ago or indeed a yakurt in the slopes of chamilunga everest the godmother of the world all of these peoples teach us there are other ways of being other ways of thinking other ways of oringing yourself in the earth and this is an idea that you think about it can only fill you with hope now together the myriad cultures of the world make up a web of spiritual life and cultural life that envelopes the planet as as important to the well being of the planet as indeed as a biological web of life that you know as a biosphere and you might think of this cultural web of life as being an ethnosphere and you might define the ethnosphere as being the some total of all thoughts and dreams ness ideas inspirations intuitions brought to being by the human imagination since the dawn of consciousness the ethnosphere is humanity's great legacy it's a symbol of all that we are and all that we can be as an astonishingly inquisitive species and just as the biosphere is being severely eroded so to as the ethnosphere and if anything at a far greater rate no biologists for example would there suggest that fifty percent of all species are more bender on the brink of extinction because it simply is not true and yet that the most apocalyptic scenario in the realm of biological diversity scarcely approaches what we know to be the most optimistic scenario in the realm of cultural diversity and the great indicator of that of course is language loss when each of you in this room were born there are six thousand languages spoken on the planet now a language is not just a body of vocabulary or set of dramatical rules a language is a flash of the human spirit it's a vehicle through which the soul of each particular culture it comes into the material world every language is an old growth forest of the mind a watershed of thought an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities and of those six thousand languages as we see here today in monterey fully half are no longer being whispered into the ears of children they're no longer being taught to babies which means effectively unless something changes they're already dead what could be more lonely than to be enveloped in silence to be the last of your people to speak your language to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors or anticipate the promise of the children and yet that dreadful fate is indeed the play is somebody somewhere on earth roughly every two weeks because every two weeks some elder dies and carries with them into the grade of the last sybles of an ancient ton and i know there some of you say well wouldn't it be better would the world be a better place if we all justpoke one language and i say great let's make that language your but let's make it cantines let's make it kogi and you'll suddenly discover what it would be like to be unable to speak your own language and so what i'd like to do with you today is to sort of take you on a journey through the ethnosphere a brief journey through the ethnosphere to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3685164)[0m we talked about some of these projects before about the human genome and what that might mean and discovering new sets of genes we're actually starting at a new point we've been digitizing biology and now we're trying to go from that digital code into a new phase of biology with designing and synthesizing life so we've always been trying to ask big questions what is life is something that i think many biologists have been trying to understand at various levels we've tried various approaches paring it down to minimal components we've been digitizing it now for almost twenty years when we sequenced the human genome that was going from the analog world of biology into the digital world of the computer now we're trying to ask can we regenerate life or can we create new life out of this digital universe this is the map of a small organism mycoplasma genitalium that has the smallest genome for a species that can self replicate in the laboratory and we've been trying to just see if we can come up with an even smaller genome we're able to knock out on the order of one hundred genes out of the five hundred or so that are here but when we look at its metabolic map it's relatively simple compared to mars trust me this is simple but when we look at all the genes that we could knock out one at a time it's very unlikely that this would yield a living cell so we decided the only way forward was to actually synthesize this chromosome so we could vary the components to ask some of these most fundamental questions and so we started down the road of can we synthesize a chromosome can chemistry permit making these really large molecules where we've never been before and if we do can we boot up a chromosome the chromosome by the way is just a piece of inner chemical material so our pace of digitizing life has been increasing at an exponential pace our ability to write the genetic code has been moving pretty slowly but has been increasing and our latest point would put it on now on exponential curve we started this over fifteen years ago it took several stages in fact starting with a bioothical review before we did the first experiments but it turns out synthesizing dna is very difficult there's tens of thousands of machines around the world that make small pieces of dna thirty to fifty letters and lengths and it's a degenerate process so the longer would make the piece the more errors there are so we had to create a new method for putting these little pieces together and correct all the errors and this was our first attempt starting with the digital information of the genome of pi x one hundred and seventy four it's a small virus that kills bacteria we designed the pieces and went through our air correction and had a dna molecule of about five thousand letters and the exciting phase when we took this piece of inner chemical and put it in the bacteria and the bacteria started to read this genetic code made the viral particles the viral particles then were released from the cells and came back and killed the e cola i was talking to the oil industry recently and i said they clearly understood that model they left more than you guys all right and so we think this is a situation where the software can actually build its own hardware in a biological system but we wanted to go much larger we wanted to build an entire bacterial chromosome it's over five hundred and eighty thousand letters of genetic code so we thought we'd build them that cassettes the size of the viruses so we could actually vary the cassettes to understand what the actual components of a living cell are design is critical and if you're starting with digital information in the computer that digital information has to be really accurate when we first sequenced this genome in nineteen ninety five the standard of accuracy was one error for ten thousand base pairs we actually found on re sequencing it thirty errors had we used that original sequence it never would have been able to be booted up and part of the design is designing pieces that are fifty letters long that have to overlap with all the other fifty letter pieces to build smaller subunits we have to design so they can go together we design unique elements into this you may have read that we put watermarks in think of this we have a four letter genetic code acg and t triplets of that letters of those letters code for roughly twenty amino acids that there's a single letter designation for each of the immuno acids so we can use the genetic code to write out words sentences thoughts initially all we did was autographic some people were disappointed there was not poetry we designed these pieces so we can just choose back with enzymes there's enzymes that repair them and put them together and we started making pieces starting with pieces that were five to seventh seven thousand letters put those together to make twenty four thousand letter pieces then put sets of those going up to seventy two thousand at each stage we grew up these pieces in abundance so we could sequence them because we're trying to create a process that's extremely robust that you can see in a minute we're trying to get to the point of automation so this looks like a basketball play off when we get into these really large pieces over one hundred thousand base pairs
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3685163)[0m i want to start by asking you to think back to when you were a kid playing with blocks as you figured out how to reach out and grasp pick them up and move them around you were actually learning how to think and solve problems by understanding and manipulating spatial relationships spatial reasoning is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of the world around us so as a computer scientist inspired by the utility of our interactions with physical objects along with my advisor paddy and my collaborator gvin colanathe i started to wonder what if when we used a computer instead of having this one mouse cursor that was like a digital fingertip moving around a flat desktop what if we could reach in with both hands and grasp information physically arranging it the way we wanted so this question was so compelling that we decided to explore the answer by building siftables in a nutshell a siftable as an interactive computer the size of a cookie they're able to be moved around by hand they can sense each other they can sense their motion and they have a screen and a wireless radio so most importantly they're physical so like the blocks you can move them just by reaching out of grasping and the cystples are an example of a new ecosystem of tools for manipulating digital information and as these tools become more physical more aware of their motion wherever each other and aware of the nuance of how we move them we can start to explore some new and fun interaction styles so i'm going to start with some simple examples the siftables can figured to show video and if i tilt in one direction and will roll the video this way if i tilt it the other way it rolls it backwards these interactive portraits are aware of each other so if i put them next to each other they get interested if they get surrounded they notice that too they might get a little flustered and they can also sense their motion and til so one of the interesting implications on interaction we started to realize was that we could use everyday gestures on data like pouring a color the way we might pour a liquid so in this case we've got three sytables can figured to be paint buggets and i can use them to pour color into that central one where they get mixed if we overshoot we can pour a little bit back there are also some neat possibilities for education like language math and logic games so we want to give people the ability to try things quickly and view the results immediately so here i'm this is a fibonacci sequence that i'm making with a simple equation program here we have a word game that's kind of like a mash up between scrabble and buggle basically in every round you can get a randomly assigned letter on each sytable and as you try to make words a chexican dictionary and then after about thirty seconds it reshuffles and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try thank you so these are some kids that came on a field trip to the media lab and i managed to get them to try it out and shoot the video they really loved it and one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don't have to give people many instructions all i have to say is make words and they know exactly what to do so here is another few people trying it out that's our youngest data tester down there on the right turns out all he wanted to do was to stack the sptables up so to him there were just bloggers now this is an interactive cartoon application and we wanted to build a learning tool for language learners and this is felix actually and he can bring new characters into the scene just by lifting the sipples off the table that have that character shown on them here he's bringing the sun out the sun is rising now he brought a tractor into the scene to the orange tractor by shaking the siptibles and putting them next to each other he can make the characters interact inventing his own narrative and it's an open ended story and he gets to decide how it unfolds why we can't so the last example i have time to show you today is a music sequencing a live performance tool that we built recently in which sptables act as sounds like lead base and drums each of these has four different variations you get to choose which one you want to use and you can inject these sounds into a sequence that you can assemble into the pattern that you want up and you inject it by just bumping up the sounds table against the sequence systable there are effects that you can control live like reverb and shilter you attach it to a particular sound and then tilt to adjust it then overall effects like tempo and volume that apply to the entire sequence so let's have a look start by putting a lead them into two sequency divals and range them into a series extend it add a little more lead now put a baseline in now put some percussion in now attach the filter to the drum so i can control the effect life i can speed up the whole sequence by chilling the tempo to one way or the other
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3685157)[0m what i'm going to show you first as quickly as i can is some foundational work some new technology that we brought to microsoft is part of an acquisition almost exactly a year ago this is sea drugon and it's an environment in which you can either locally remotely interact with vast amounts of visual data we're looking at many many gigabytes of digital photos here and seamlessly continuously zooming in hadding through the thing we ranging it any way we want and it doesn't matter how much information we're looking at how big these collections are or how big the images are and most of them are ordinary digital camera photos but this one for example is a scan from the library of congress and it's in a three hundred megapixel range it doesn't make any difference because the only thing that ought to limit the performance of a system like this one is the number of pixels on your screen at any given moment it's also a very flexible architecture this is an entire book this is an example of non image data this is a blue house like dickens every column is a chapter and to prove to you that it's really text and not an image we can do something like so to really show that this is a real representation of the text it's not a picture maybe this is a kind of artificial way to read an e book i wouldn't recommend it this is a more realistic case this is an issue of the guardian every large images the beginning of a section and this really gives you the joy and the good experience of reading the real paper version of of a magazine or a newspaper which is an inherently multi scale kind of medium we've also done a little something with the corner of this particular issue of the garden we've made up a fake ad that's a very high resolution much higher than you be able to get in an ordinary ad and we've embedded extra content you go to see the features of this car you can see it here or other models or even tagging specifications and this really gets at some of these ideas about really doing away with those limits on screen real estate we hope that this means no more pop ups kind of rubbish like that should be necessary of course mapping is one of those really obvious applications for technology like this and this one i really won't spend any time on except to say that we have things to contribute to this field as well but those are all the roads in the u s superimposed on top of a nasa geo spatial image so let's pull up now something else so this is actually live on the live on the web now you can go check it out this is a project called photosynth which really marries different tchnologies one of them is seed dragon and the other is some very beautiful computer vision research done by no navel agatas in the norse of washington co advised by steve sites at you doug and ricks a listed microsoft research a very nice collaboration and so this is live on the web it's powered by sea drug and you can see that when we kind of do these sorts of views where we can dive through images and have this kind of multi revolution experience but the spatial arrangement of the images here is actually meaningful the computer vision algorithms have registered these images together so they correspond to the real space in which these shots are all taken near grassy lakes nickanaan rockies all these shots were taken so you see elements here of stabilized slide show or panoramic panoramic imaging and these things have all been related related spatially i'm not sure if i have if i have time to show you any other environments there are some much more spatial but i'd like to jump straight to one of those original data sets and this is from an early prototype of photosynth that we first got working in the summer to show you what i think is really the punchline behind this technology the photosynth technology and it's not necessarily so apparent from looking at the environments that we put up on the website we had to worry about the lawyers and so on so this is a reconstruction of metrodom cathedral that was done entirely computationally from images scraped from flickr and just type metrodom into flickr and you get some pictures of guys and t shirts of the campus and so on and each of these orange cones represents an image that was discovered to belong to this model and so these are all flickr images and they've all been related spatially in this way we can just navigate in this very simple way i never thought that i'd end up working at microsoft was very gratified this kind of reception here so as you can see this this is lots of different types of cameras that's everything from cellphone cameras to professional slr quite a large number of inventors get into this environment if i can find some of the sort of weird ones there are so many of them are included by faces and so on there's somewhere in here there's actually a series of photographs here we go this is actually a poster of notradom that registered correctly so if you know we can dive in from the poster to a physical view of this environment what the point here really is is that we can do things with the social environment this is now taking data from everybody from the entire collective memory visually of what earth looks like and link all of that together all those photos become linked together and they make something emergent that is greater than some of the parts you have a model that emergence of the entire earth think of this as the long tail to stephen moller's
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3685153)[0m i'm going to talk to you about some stuff that's in this book of mind that i hope will resonate with other things that you've already heard and i'll try to make some connections myself in case you miss them but i want to start with what i call the official dogma if you're dogma of what the official dogma of all western industrial societies and the official dog runs like this if we are interested in maximizing the welfare of our citizens the way to do that is to maximize individual freedom the reason for this is both that freedom is in and of itself good valuable worthwhile essential to being human and because if people have freedom then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will maximize our welfare and no one has to decide on our behalf the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice the more choice people have the more freedom they have and the more freedom they have the more welfare they have this i think is so deeply embedded in the water supply that it wouldn't occur to anyone to question it and it's also deeply embedded in our lives i'll give you some examples of what modern progress has made possible for us this is my supermarket not such a big one i want to say just a word about saladdressing one hundred and seventy five saladdressings in my supermarket if you don't count the ten extraversion olive oils and twelve ball samic vinigers you could buy to make a very large number of your own saladdressings in the off chance that none of one hundred and seventy five the store has an offer situ so this is what the supermarket is like and then you go to the consumer electronic store to set up a stereo system speakers cd player tape player tunor amplifier and in this one single consumer electronic store there are that many stereo systems we can construct six and a half million different stereo systems out of the components that are on offer in one store you've got to admit that's a lot of choice in other domains the world of communications there was a time when i was a boy when you could get any kind of telephone service you wanted as long as it came from mob bell you rented your phone you didn't buy it one consequence of that by the way is that the phone never broke and those days are gone we now have an almost unlimited variety of phones especially in the world of cellphones these are cellphones in the future my favorite is the middle one the mp three player nose hair tremor and tremble tort and if if by some chance you haven't seen that in your store yet you can rest assured that one day soon you will and what this does is it leads people to walk into their stores asking this question and do you know what the answer to this question now is the answer is no it is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too much so in other aspects of life that are much more significant than buying things the same explosion of choice is true in healthcare it is no longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you what to do instead you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you what we could do a or we could do b a has these benefits and these risks be has these benefits and these risks what do you want to do and you say doc what should i do and the doc says a has these benefits and risks and has these benefits and risks what do you want to do and you say if you were me doc what would you do and the doc says but i'm not you and the result is we call a patient autonomy which makes it sound like a good thing but what it really is is a shifting of the burden and the responsibility for decision making from somebody who knows something namely the doctor somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sick and us not in the best shape to be making decisions namely the patient there's enormous marketing of prescription drugs to people like you and me which if you think about it makes no sense at all since we can't buy them why do they market to us if we can't buy them the answer is that they expect us to call our doctors the next morning and ask for our prescriptions to be changed something as dramatic as our identity is now become a matter of choice as the slide is meant to indicate we get to we don't inherit an identity we get to invent it and we get to reinvent ourselves as often as we like and that means that every day when you wake up in the morning you have to decide what kind of person you want to be with respect to marriage and family there was a time when the default assumption that almost everyone had is that you got married as soon as you could and then you started having kids as soon as you could the only real choice was who not when and not what you did after nowadays everything is very much up for grabs i teach wonderfully intelligent students and i assigned twenty percent less work than i used to and it's not because they're less smart and it's not because they're less diligent it's because they are preoccupied asking themselves should i get married or not should i get married now should i get married later should i have kids first or a career first all of these are consuming questions and they're going to answer these questions whether or not it means not doing all the work i assign and not getting a good grade in my courses and indeed they should these are important questions to answer work we are blessed as corals pointing out with the technology that enables us to work every minute of every day from any place on the planet except the random hotel there is one corner by the way that i'm not going to tell anybody about where you actually where the wi fi works i'm not telling you about it because i want to use it so what this means this incredible freedom of choice we have with respect to work is that we have to make a decision again and again and again about whether we should or shouldn't be working we can go to watch our kid play soccer and we have our cellphone on one hip and our blackberry on our other hip and our laptop presumably on our laps and even if they're all shut off every minute that we're watching our kid mutilated a soccer game we are also asking ourselves should i answer this cell phone calls should i respond to this email should i drive this letter and even if the answer to the question is no it's certainly going to make the experience of your kid's soccer game very different than it would have been so everywhere we look big things and small things material things and lifestyle things life is a matter of choice and the world we used to live in look like this that is to say there were some choices but not everything was a matter of choice and the world we now live in looks like this and the question is that is this good news or bad news and the answer is yes we all know what's good about it so i'm going to talk about what's bad about it all this choice has two effects two negative effects on people one effect paradoxically is that it produces paralysis rather than liberation with so many options to choose from people find it very difficult to choose at all i'll give you one very dramatic example of this a study that was done of investments in voluntary retirement plans a colleague of mine got access to
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3685157)[0m RESETTING HISORY
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3685164)[0m we talked about some of these projects before about the human genome and what that might mean and discovering new sets of genes we're actually starting at a new point we've been digitizing biology and now we're trying to go from that digital code into a new phase of biology with designing and synthesizing life so we've always been trying to ask big questions what is life is something that i think many biologists have been trying to understand at various levels we've tried various approaches paring it down to minimal components we've been digitizing it now for almost twenty years when we sequenced the human genome that was going from the analog world of biology into the digital world of the computer now we're trying to ask can we regenerate life or can we create new life out of this digital universe this is the map of a small organism mycoplasma genitalium that has the smallest genome for a species that can self replicate in the laboratory and we've been trying to just see if we can come up with an even smaller genome we're able to knock out on the order of one hundred genes out of the five hundred or so that are here but when we look at its metabolic map it's relatively simple compared to mars trust me this is simple but when we look at all the genes that we could knock out one at a time it's very unlikely that this would yield a living cell so we decided the only way forward was to actually synthesize this chromosome so we could vary the components to ask some of these most fundamental questions and so we started down the road of can we synthesize a chromosome can chemistry permit making these really large molecules where we've never been before and if we do can we boot up a chromosome the chromosome by the way is just a piece of inner chemical material so our pace of digitizing life has been increasing at an exponential pace our ability to write the genetic code has been moving pretty slowly but has been increasing and our latest point would put it on now on exponential curve we started this over fifteen years ago it took several stages in fact starting with a bioothical review before we did the first experiments but it turns out synthesizing dna is very difficult there's tens of thousands of machines around the world that make small pieces of dna thirty to fifty letters and lengths and it's a degenerate process so the longer would make the piece the more errors there are so we had to create a new method for putting these little pieces together and correct all the errors and this was our first attempt starting with the digital information of the genome of pi x one hundred and seventy four it's a small virus that kills bacteria we designed the pieces and went through our air correction and had a dna molecule of about five thousand letters and the exciting phase when we took this piece of inner chemical and put it in the bacteria and the bacteria started to read this genetic code made the viral particles the viral particles then were released from the cells and came back and killed the e cola i was talking to the oil industry recently and i said they clearly understood that model they left more than you guys all right and so we think this is a situation where the software can actually build its own hardware in a biological system but we wanted to go much larger we wanted to build an entire bacterial chromosome it's over five hundred and eighty thousand letters of genetic code so we thought we'd build them that cassettes the size of the viruses so we could actually vary the cassettes to understand what the actual components of a living cell are design is critical and if you're starting with digital information in the computer that digital information has to be really accurate when we first sequenced this genome in nineteen ninety five the standard of accuracy was one error for ten thousand base pairs we actually found on re sequencing it thirty errors had we used that original sequence it never would have been able to be booted up and part of the design is designing pieces that are fifty letters long that have to overlap with all the other fifty letter pieces to build smaller subunits we have to design so they can go together we design unique elements into this you may have read that we put watermarks in think of this we have a four letter genetic code acg and t triplets of that letters of those letters code for roughly twenty amino acids that there's a single letter designation for each of the immuno acids so we can use the genetic code to write out words sentences thoughts initially all we did was autographic some people were disappointed there was not poetry we designed these pieces so we can just choose back with enzymes there's enzymes that repair them and put them together and we started making pieces starting with pieces that were five to seventh seven thousand letters put those together to make twenty four thousand letter pieces then put sets of those going up to seventy two thousand at each stage we grew up these pieces in abundance so we could sequence them because we're trying to create a process that's extremely robust that you can see in a minute we're trying to get to the point of automation so this looks like a basketball play off when we get into these really large pieces over one hundred thousand base pairs they won't any longer grow readily any cola it exhaust all the modern tools of molecular biology and so we turned to other mechanisms we knew there's a mechanism called homologous recombination that biology uses to repair dna that can put pieces together here's an example of it there's an organism called dinococcus radiodurans that can take three million rads of radiation you can see in the top panel its chromosome just gets blown apart twelve to twenty four hours later it put it back together exactly as it was before we have thousands of organisms that can do this these organisms can be totally desticated they can live in a vacuum i am absolutely certain that life can exist in outer space move around find a new acre environment in fact nasa has shown a lot of this is out there here's an actual micrograph of the molecule we built using these processes actually just using yeast mechanisms with the right design of the pieces we put them in yeast put some together automatically this is not an electron micrograph this is just a regular photo micrograph it's such a large molecule we can see it with a light microscope these are pictures over about a six second period so this is the publication we had just a short while ago this is over five hundred and eighty thousand letters of genetic code it's the largest molecule ever made by humans of a defined structure it's over three hundred million molecular weight if we print it out at a ten font with no spacing it takes one hundred and forty two pages just to print this genetic code well how do we boot up a chromosome how do we activate this obviously with the virus it's pretty simple it's much more complicated dealing with bacteria

official dog runs like this if we are interested in maximizing the welfare of our citizens the way to do that is to maximize individual freedom the reason for this is both that freedom is in and of

about a million employees in about two thousand different workplaces and what she found is that but for every ten mutual funds the employer offered rate of participation went down two percent you offer fifty funds ten percent fewer employees participate than if you only offer five why because with fifty funds to choose from it's so damn hard to decide which fund to choose that you'll just put it off to tomorrow and then tomorrow and then tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow and of course tomorrow never comes understand that not only does this mean that people are going to have to eat dog food when they retire because they don't have enough money put away it also means that making the decisions so hard that they pass up significant matching money from the employer by not participating they are passing up as much as five thousand dollars a year from the employer who would happily match their contribution so paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices and i think it makes the world look like this

the world look like this you really want to get the decision right if it's for all eternity right you don't want to pick the wrong mutual fund or even the wrong saladress so that's one effect the second effect is that even if we manage to overcome the paralysis and make a choice we end up less satisfied with the result of the choice than we would be if we have fewer options to choose from and there are several reasons for this one of them is that with a lot of different sal addressings to choose from if you buy one and it's not perfect and you know what sal addressing is it's easy to imagine that you could have made a different choice that would have been better and what happens is this imagined alternative induces you to regret the decision you made and this regrets subtracts from the satisfacts and you get out of the decision you made even if it was a good decision the more options there are the easier it is to regret anything at all that is disappointing about the option that you chose second what economists call opportunity costs dan gilbert made a big point this morning of talking about how how much the way in which we value things depends on what we compare them to well when there are lots of alternatives to consider it is easy to imagine the attractive features of alternatives that you reject
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3685162)[0m you know one of the intense pleasures of travel and one of the delights of ethnographic research is the opportunity to live amongst those who have not forgotten the old ways who still feel their past and the wind touch it in stones polished by rain tasted in the bitter leaves of plants just to know that jaguar shamans still journey beyond the milky way or the the myths of the inuit elders still resonate with meaning or that in the himalaya the buddhist still pursue the breath of the darma is to really remember the central revelation of anthropology and that is the idea that the world in which we live in does not exist in some absolute sense but it's just one model of reality the consequence of one particular set of adapt of choices that our lineage made i'll be it successfully many generations ag and of course we all share the same adaptive imperatives we're all born we all bring our children to the world we go through initiation rights we have to deal with the inexible separation of death so it should't surprise us that we all see we all dance we all have art but what's interesting is the unique cadence of the song the rhythm of the dance in every culture and whether it is the panan in the forests of borneo or the vodo atollites in haiti or the warriors in the kissed desert of northern kenya the quandta in the mountains of the andes or a cut of a city in the middle of the sahara this is incidentally the fellow that i traveled into the desert with a month ago or indeed a yakurt in the slopes of chamilunga everest the godmother of the world all of these peoples teach us there are other ways of being other ways of thinking other ways of oringing yourself in the earth and this is an idea that you think about it can only fill you with hope now together the myriad cultures of the world make up a web of spiritual life and cultural life that envelopes the planet as as important to the well being of the planet as indeed as a biological web of life that you know as a biosphere and you might think of this cultural web of life as being an ethnosphere and you might define the ethnosphere as being the some total of all thoughts and dreams ness ideas inspirations intuitions brought to being by the human imagination since the dawn of consciousness the ethnosphere is humanity's great legacy it's a symbol of all that we are and all that we can be as an astonishingly inquisitive species and just as the biosphere is being severely eroded so to as the ethnosphere and if anything at a far greater rate no biologists for example would there suggest that fifty percent of all species are more bender on the brink of extinction because it simply is not true and yet that the most apocalyptic scenario in the realm of biological diversity scarcely approaches what we know to be the most optimistic scenario in the realm of cultural diversity and the great indicator of that of course is language loss when each of you in this room were born there are six thousand languages spoken on the planet now a language is not just a body of vocabulary or set of dramatical rules a language is a flash of the human spirit it's a vehicle through which the soul of each particular culture it comes into the material world every language is an old growth forest of the mind a watershed of thought an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities and of those six thousand languages as we see here today in monterey fully half are no longer being whispered into the ears of children they're no longer being taught to babies which means effectively unless something changes they're already dead what could be more lonely than to be enveloped in silence to be the last of your people to speak your language to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors or anticipate the promise of the children and yet that dreadful fate is indeed the play is somebody somewhere on earth roughly every two weeks because every two weeks some elder dies and carries with them into the grade of the last sybles of an ancient ton and i know there some of you say well wouldn't it be better would the world be a better place if we all justpoke one language and i say great let's make that language your but let's make it cantines let's make it kogi and you'll suddenly discover what it would be like to be unable to speak your own language and so what i'd like to do with you today is to sort of take you on a journey through the ethnosphere a brief journey through the ethnosphere to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost now there are many of us who sort of forget that when i say different ways of being i really do mean different ways of being take for example this child of the barasana northwest amazon people of the anaconda who believe that mythologically they came up the milk rivers in the east and the belly of sacred snakes now this is a people who cognitively do not distinguish the color blue from the color green because the canopy of the heavens is equated to the canopy of the forest upon which the people depend they have a curious language and marriage rule which is called linguistic exogamy you must marry someone who speaks a different language and this is all rooted in mythological past you have the curious things in these long houses where there are six or seven languages spoken because of intermarriage you never hear anyone practicing a language they simply listen and then begin to speak or one of the most fascinating tribes ever lived with the watani of north eastern ecuador and astonishing people first contacted peacefully in nineteen fifty eight and nineteen fifty seven five missionaries attempted contact made a critical mistake they dropped from the air eight by ten glossy photographs of themselves and what we would say to be friendly gestures for getting these people of the rainforest had never seen anything two dimensional in their lives they picked up these photographs on the forest floor tried to look behind the face to fly the form of the figure found nothing and concluded these were calling cards in the devil so they speared the five missionaries to death but the watan didn't just spear outsiders they speared each other fifty four percent of the mortality was to do them spearing each other we traced genealogies backage generations and we found two instances of natural death and when we pressured the people a little bit about it they admitted that one of the fellows had gotten so old that he died getting old so we speared him anyway but at the same time at a postercatious knowledge of the force that was astonishing their hunters could smell animals yearn at forty paces and tell you what species left behind in the early eighties i had a really astonishing assignment when i was asked by my professor at harvard if i was interested in going down to haiti infiltrating the secret societies which were the foundation of devaluous strength and the tota mac and security and the poison used to make zambies in order to make sense of sensation of course i had to understand something about this remarkable faith of medune and buda is not a black magic cult on the contrary it's a complex metaphysical worldview it's interesting if i asked you the name of the great religions of the world what would you say christianity islam buddhism judhism whatever there's always one continent left out is the assumption being that sub saharan africa had no religious belief well of course they did and vod is simply the distallation of these very the found religious ideas that came over during the tragic diosor of the slavery era but what makes vote so interesting is that it's this living relationship between living and the deads the living the birth the spirits the spirits can be invoked from beneath the great water responding to the rhythm of the dance to momentarily displays the soul of the living for that brief shining moment the a light becomes the god that's why the vodouists like to say that the white people go to church and speak about god we dance in the temple and become god and because you are possessed you are taken by a spirit how can you be harmed you see these astonishing
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3685161)[0m i am my writer writing books is my profession but it's more than that of course it is also my great lifelong love and fascination and i don't expect that that's ever going to change but that said something kind of peculiar has happened recently in my life and in my career which has caused me to have to sort of recalibrate my whole relationship with this work and the peculiar thing is that i recently wrote this book this memoir called a pre love which decidedly unlike any of my previous books went out in the world for some reason and became this big mega sensation international best seller thing the result of which is that everywhere i go now people treat me like i'm doomed seriously doomed they come up to me all worried and they say aren't you afraid aren't you afraid you're never going to be able to top that aren't you afraid you're going to keep writing for your whole life and you're never again going to create a book that anybody in the world cares about at all ever again so that's reassuring you know but it would be worse except for that i happened to remember that over twenty years ago when i first started telling people when i was a teenager that i wanted to be a writer i was met with this same kind of sort of fear based reaction and people would say aren't too afraid you're never going to have any success aren't too afraid the humiliation of rejection will kill you aren't too afraid that you're going to work your whole life at this craft and nothings that are going to come with it you're going to die on a scrap of broken dreams with your mouth filled with bitter ash of failure like that you know and the answer the short answer to all those questions is yes yes i'm afraid of all those things and i always have been and i'm afraid of many many more things besides that you know people can't even guess out like seaweed and other things that are scary but when it comes to writing the thing that i've been sort of thinking about lately and wondering about lately is why you know is it rational is it logical that anybody should be expected to be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this earth to do you know and what is it specifically about creative ventures this seems to make us really nervous about each other's mental health in a way that other careers kind of don't do you know like my dad for example was a chemical engineer i don't recall once in his forty years of chemical engineering anybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer you know it just didn't like that chemical engineering block john you know housical and it just didn't come up like that you know but to be fair right chemical engineers as a group you know haven't really earned a reputation over the centuries for being alcoholic manic depressives and we writers you know we kind of do have that reputation not just writers but creative people across all shores it seems to have this reputation for being enormously mentally unstable and you know all you have to do is look at the very grim death count in the twentieth century alone of really magnificent creative minds who died young and often at their own hands you know and even the ones who didn't literally commit suicide seem to be really undone and by their gifts you know norman mayler just before he died the last interview he said every one of my books has killed me a little more an extraordinary statement to make about your life's work you know but we don't even blink when we hear somebody say this because we've heard that kind of stuff for so long and somehow we've completely internalized and accepted collectively this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow inherently linked and that artistry in the end will always ultimately lead to anguish and the question that i want to ask everybody here today is are you guys all cool with that idea think are you comfortable with that because you look at it even from an inch way and you know i'm not at all comfortable with that assumption i think it's odious and i also think it's dangerous and i don't want to see it perpetuated into the next century i think better if we encourage you know our great creative minds to live you know and i definitely know that in my case in my situation it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of leaking down that dark path of assumption you know particularly given the circumstance that i'm in right now in my career which is you know like check it out i'm pretty young i'm only about forty years old i still have maybe another four decades of work left in me and it's exceedingly likely that anything i write from this point forward is going to be judged by the world as the work that came after the freakish success of my last book i should just go bluntly because we're all sort of friends here now it's exceedingly likely that my greatest success is behind me jesus what a thought like that's the kind of thought that could lead a person to start drinking gin at nine o'clock in the morning and you know i don't want to go there you know i would prefer to keep doing this work that i love and so the question becomes how you know and so it seems to me upon a lot of reflection the way that i have to work now in order to continue writing is that i have to create some sort of protective psychological construct right i have to find some way to have a safe distance you know between me as i am writing and my very natural anxiety about what the reaction to that writing is going to be from now on and as i've been looking over the last year for like models for how to do that i've been sort of looking across time and i've been trying to find like other societies to see if they might have had better and saner ideas than we have about how to help creative people manage the inherent emotional risks of creativity and that search has led me to ancient grease in ancient rome to stay with me because it does circle around back but ancient crease ancient rome people did not happen to believe that creativity came from human beings back then ok people believed that creativity was this divine attendant spirit that came to human beings from some distant and unknowable source for distant and unknowable reasons the greeks famously called these divine attendant spirits of creativity daymens socrates famously believed that he had a dayman who spoke wisdom to him from far the romans had the same idea but they called that sort of disembodied creative spirit a genius which is great because the romans did not actually think that a genius was a particularly clever individual they believe that a genius was the sort of magical divine entity who was believed to literally live in the walls of an artist's studio kind of like doobby the houself and who would come out and invisibly assist the artist with the work and would shape the outcome of that work so brilliant there it is right there at that distance that i'm talking about that psychological construct to protect you from the results of your work you know and everyone knew that this is how it functioned right so the ancient artist was protected from certain things like for example too much narcissism right if your work was brilliant couldn't take all the credit for it everybody knew you had this like disembody genius who had helped you if your work bombed not entirely your fault you know everyone knew your genius was kind of lame and this is how people thought about creativity in the west for a really long time creativity in the west for a really long time and then the renaissance came and everything changed and we had this big idea and the big idea was let's put the individual human being at the center of the universe right above all gods and mysteries and there's no more room for like mystical creatures who take dictation from the divine and it's the beginning of rational humanism and people started to believe that creativity came completely from the self of the individual and for the first time in history you start to hear people referring to this or that artist as being a genius rather than having a genius and i've got to tell you i think that was a huge error you know i think that allowing somebody like one mere person to believe that he or she is like the vessel you know like the font and the essence and the source of all divine creative unknowable eternal mystery is just like a smidge too much responsibility to put on one fragile human psyche it's like asking somebody to swallow the sun you know it just completely warps into sorts egos and it creates all these unmanagable expectations about performance and i think the pressure of that that has been killing off our artists for the last five hundred years and if this is true and i think it is true the question becomes you know what now you know can we do this differently maybe go back to some more ancient understanding about the relationship between humans and the creative mystery maybe not you know maybe we can't just erase five hundred years of rational humanistic thought in one eighteen minutes teach and there's probably people in this audience who would raise like really legitimate scientific suspicions about the notion of basically fairies who follow people around like rubbing fairy juice on their projects and stuff like i'm not probably going to bring you all along with me on this but the question that i kind of want to pose is why not why not think about it this way because it makes as much sense as anything else i have ever heard
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3685153)[0m i'm going to talk to you about some stuff that's in this book of mind that i hope will resonate with other things that you've already heard and i'll try to make some connections myself in case you miss them but i want to start with what i call the official dogma if you're dogma of what the official dogma of all western industrial societies and the official dog runs like this if we are interested in maximizing the welfare of our citizens the way to do that is to maximize individual freedom the reason for this is both that freedom is in and of itself good valuable worthwhile essential to being human and because if people have freedom then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will maximize our welfare and no one has to decide on our behalf the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice the more choice people have the more freedom they have and the more freedom they have the more welfare they have this i think is so deeply embedded in the water supply that it wouldn't occur to anyone to question it and it's also deeply embedded in our lives i'll give you some examples of what modern progress has made possible for us this is my supermarket not such a big one i want to say just a word about saladdressing one hundred and seventy five saladdressings in my supermarket if you don't count the ten extraversion olive oils and twelve ball samic vinigers you could buy to make a very large number of your own saladdressings in the off chance that none of one hundred and seventy five the store has an offer situ so this is what the supermarket is like and then you go to the consumer electronic store to set up a stereo system speakers cd player tape player tunor amplifier and in this one single consumer electronic store there are that many stereo systems we can construct six and a half million different stereo systems out of the components that are on offer in one store you've got to admit that's a lot of choice in other domains the world of communications there was a time when i was a boy when you could get any kind of telephone service you wanted as long as it came from mob bell you rented your phone you didn't buy it one consequence of that by the way is that the phone never broke and those days are gone we now have an almost unlimited variety of phones especially in the world of cellphones these are cellphones in the future my favorite is the middle one the mp three player nose hair tremor and tremble tort and if if by some chance you haven't seen that in your store yet you can rest assured that one day soon you will and what this does is it leads people to walk into their stores asking this question and do you know what the answer to this question now is the answer is no it is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too much so in other aspects of life that are much more significant than buying things the same explosion of choice is true in healthcare it is no longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you what to do instead you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you what we could do a or we could do b a has these benefits and these risks be has these benefits and these risks what do you want to do and you say doc what should i do and the doc says a has these benefits and risks and has these benefits and risks what do you want to do and you say if you were me doc what would you do and the doc says but i'm not you and the result is we call a patient autonomy which makes it sound like a good thing but what it really is is a shifting of the burden and the responsibility for decision making from somebody who knows something namely the doctor somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sick and us not in the best shape to be making decisions namely the patient there's enormous marketing of prescription drugs to people like you and me which if you think about it makes no sense at all since we can't buy them why do they market to us if we can't buy them the answer is that they expect us to call our doctors the next morning and ask for our prescriptions to be changed something as dramatic as our identity is now become a matter of choice as the slide is meant to indicate we get to we don't inherit an identity we get to invent it and we get to reinvent ourselves as often as we like and that means that every day when you wake up in the morning you have to decide what kind of person you want to be with respect to marriage and family there was a time when the default assumption that almost everyone had is that you got married as soon as you could and then you started having kids as soon as you could the only real choice was who not when and not what you did after nowadays everything is very much up for grabs i teach wonderfully intelligent students and i assigned twenty percent less work than i used to and it's not because they're less smart and it's not because they're less diligent it's because they are preoccupied asking themselves should i get married or not should i get married now should i get married later should i have kids first or a career first all of these are consuming questions and they're going to answer these questions whether or not it means not doing all the work i assign and not getting a good grade in my courses and indeed they should these are important questions to answer work we are blessed as corals pointing out with the technology that enables us to work every minute of every day from any place on the planet except the random hotel there is one corner by the way that i'm not going to tell anybody about where you actually where the wi fi works i'm not telling you about it because i want to use it so what this means this incredible freedom of choice we have with respect to work is that we have to make a decision again and again and again about whether we should or shouldn't be working we can go to watch our kid play soccer and we have our cellphone on one hip and our blackberry on our other hip and our laptop presumably on our laps and even if they're all shut off every minute that we're watching our kid mutilated a soccer game we are also asking ourselves should i answer this cell phone calls should i respond to this email should i drive this letter and even if the answer to the question is no it's certainly going to make the experience of your kid's soccer game very different than it would have been so everywhere we look big things and small things material things and lifestyle things life is a matter of choice and the world we used to live in look like this that is to say there were some choices but not everything was a matter of choice and the world we now live in looks like this and the question is that is this good news or bad news and the answer is yes we all know what's good about it so i'm going to talk about what's bad about it all this choice has two effects two negative effects on people one effect paradoxically is that it produces paralysis rather than liberation with so many options to choose from people find it very difficult to choose at all i'll give you one very dramatic example of this a study that was done of investments in voluntary retirement plans a colleague of mine got access to investment records from vanguard the gigantic mutual fund company of about a million employees in about two thousand different workplaces and what she found is that but for every ten mutual funds the employer offered rate of participation went down two percent you offer fifty funds ten percent fewer employees participate than if you only offer five why because with fifty funds to choose from it's so damn hard to decide which fund to choose that you'll just put it off to tomorrow and then tomorrow and then tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow and of course tomorrow never comes understand that not only does this mean that people are going to have to eat dog food when they retire because they don't have enough money put away it also means that making the decisions so hard that they pass up significant matching money from the employer by not participating they are passing up as much as five thousand dollars a year from the employer who would happily match their contribution so paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices and i think it makes the world look like this you really want to get the decision right if it's for all eternity right you don't want to pick the wrong mutual fund or even the wrong saladress so that's one effect the second effect is that even if we manage to overcome the paralysis and make a choice we end up less satisfied with the result of the choice than we would be if we have fewer options to choose from and there are several reasons for this one of them is that with a lot of different sal addressings to choose from if you buy one and it's not perfect and you know what sal addressing is it's easy to imagine that you could have made a different choice that would have been better and what happens is this imagined alternative induces you to regret the decision you made and this regrets subtracts from the satisfacts and you get out of the decision you made even if it was a good decision the more options there are the easier it is to regret anything at all that is disappointing about the option that you chose second what economists call opportunity costs dan gilbert made a big point this morning of talking about how how much the way in which we value things depends on what we compare them to well when there are lots of alternatives to consider it is easy to imagine the attractive features of alternatives that you reject that make you less satisfied with the alternative that you've chosen here's an example for those of you who are new yorkers i apologize but here's what you're supposed to be thinking here's this couple on the hamptons very expensive real estate gorgeous beach beautiful day they have it all to themselves what could be better well dammit this guy is thinking it's august everybody in my manhattan neighborhood is a way i could be parking right in front of my building and he spends two weeks nagged by the idea that he is missing the opportunity day after day to have a great parking space the opportunity costs subtract from the satisfaction we get out of what we choose even when what we choose is terrific and the more options there are to consider the more attractive features of these options are going to be reflected by us as opportunity costs here's another example now this cartoon makes a lot of points it makes points about living in the moment as well and probably about doing things slowly but one point it makes is that whenever you're choosing one thing you're choosing not to do other things and those other things may have lots of attractive features and it's going to make what you're doing less attractive third escalation of expectations this hit me when i went to replace my genes i wear genes almost all the time and there was a time when genes came in one flavor and you bought them and they fit like crap and they were incredibly uncomfortable and if you wear them along enough and wash them enough times they started to fit feel ok so i went to replace my genes after years and years of wearing these old ones and i said i you know going to pair genes there's my size on the shop keeper said do you want slim fit easy fit relaxed fit you want button fly or zipper fly you want stone wash or acid wash you want them distressed you want boot cut you want tapered blah blah blah on it and he went my jaw dropped and after i recovered i said i want the kind that used to be the only kind so he had no idea what that was so i spent an hour trying on all these damn genes and i walked out of the store truth with the best fitting genes i had ever had i did better all this choice made it possible for me to do better but i felt worse why were a whole book to try to explain this to myself the reason is
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3685164)[0m we talked about some of these projects before about the human genome and what that might mean and discovering new sets of genes we're actually starting at a new point we've been digitizing biology and now we're trying to go from that digital code into a new phase of biology with designing and synthesizing life so we've always been trying to ask big questions what is life is something that i think many biologists have been trying to understand at various levels we've tried various approaches paring it down to minimal components we've been digitizing it now for almost twenty years when we sequenced the human genome that was going from the analog world of biology into the digital world of the computer now we're trying to ask can we regenerate life or can we create new life out of this digital universe this is the map of a small organism mycoplasma genitalium that has the smallest genome for a species that can self replicate in the laboratory and we've been trying to just see if we can come up with an even smaller genome we're able to knock out on the order of one hundred genes out of the five hundred or so that are here but when we look at its metabolic map it's relatively simple compared to mars trust me this is simple but when we look at all the genes that we could knock out one at a time it's very unlikely that this would yield a living cell so we decided the only way forward was to actually synthesize this chromosome so we could vary the components to ask some of these most fundamental questions and so we started down the road of can we synthesize a chromosome can chemistry permit making these really large molecules where we've never been before and if we do can we boot up a chromosome the chromosome by the way is just a piece of inner chemical material so our pace of digitizing life has been increasing at an exponential pace our ability to write the genetic code has been moving pretty slowly but has been increasing and our latest point would put it on now on exponential curve we started this over fifteen years ago it took several stages in fact starting with a bioothical review before we did the first experiments but it turns out synthesizing dna is very difficult there's tens of thousands of machines around the world that make small pieces of dna thirty to fifty letters and lengths and it's a degenerate process so the longer would make the piece the more errors there are so we had to create a new method for putting these little pieces together and correct all the errors and this was our first attempt starting with the digital information of the genome of pi x one hundred and seventy four it's a small virus that kills bacteria we designed the pieces and went through our air correction and had a dna molecule of about five thousand letters and the exciting phase when we took this piece of inner chemical and put it in the bacteria and the bacteria started to read this genetic code made the viral particles the viral particles then were released from the cells and came back and killed the e cola i was talking to the oil industry recently and i said they clearly understood that model they left more than you guys all right and so we think this is a situation where the software can actually build its own hardware in a biological system but we wanted to go much larger we wanted to build an entire bacterial chromosome it's over five hundred and eighty thousand letters of genetic code so we thought we'd build them that cassettes the size of the viruses so we could actually vary the cassettes to understand what the actual components of a living cell are design is critical and if you're starting with digital information in the computer that digital information has to be really accurate when we first sequenced this genome in nineteen ninety five the standard of accuracy was one error for ten thousand base pairs we actually found on re sequencing it thirty errors had we used that original sequence it never would have been able to be booted up and part of the design is designing pieces that are fifty letters long that have to overlap with all the other fifty letter pieces to build smaller subunits we have to design so they can go together we design unique elements into this you may have read that we put watermarks in think of this we have a four letter genetic code acg and t triplets of that letters of those letters code for roughly twenty amino acids that there's a single letter designation for each of the immuno acids so we can use the genetic code to write out words sentences thoughts initially all we did was autographic some people were disappointed there was not poetry we designed these pieces so we can just choose back with enzymes there's enzymes that repair them and put them together and we started making pieces starting with pieces that were five to seventh seven thousand letters put those together to make twenty four thousand letter pieces then put sets of those going up to seventy two thousand at each stage we grew up these pieces in abundance so we could sequence them because we're trying to create a process that's extremely robust that you can see in a minute we're trying to get to the point of automation so this looks like a basketball play off when we get into these really large pieces over one hundred thousand base pairs they won't any longer grow readily any cola it exhaust all the modern tools of molecular biology and so we turned to other mechanisms we knew there's a mechanism called homologous recombination that biology uses to repair dna that can put pieces together here's an example of it there's an organism called dinococcus radiodurans that can take three million rads of radiation you can see in the top panel its chromosome just gets blown apart twelve to twenty four hours later it put it back together exactly as it was before we have thousands of organisms that can do this these organisms can be totally desticated they can live in a vacuum i am absolutely certain that life can exist in outer space move around find a new acre environment in fact nasa has shown a lot of this is out there here's an actual micrograph of the molecule we built using these processes actually just using yeast mechanisms with the right design of the pieces we put them in yeast put some together automatically this is not an electron micrograph this is just a regular photo micrograph it's such a large molecule we can see it with a light microscope these are pictures over about a six second period so this is the publication we had just a short while ago this is over five hundred and eighty thousand letters of genetic code it's the largest molecule ever made by humans of a defined structure it's over three hundred million molecular weight if we print it out at a ten font with no spacing it takes one hundred and forty two pages just to print this genetic code well how do we boot up a chromosome how do we activate this obviously with the virus it's pretty simple it's much more complicated dealing with bacteria it's also simpler when you go into eukaryots like ourselves you can just pop out the nucleus and pop in another one and that's what you've all heard about with cloning with bacteria archaea the chromosome is integrated into the cell but we recently showed that we can do a complete transplant of a chromosome from one cell to another and activated we purified a chromosome from one microbial species roughly these tour as distant as human and mice we had a few extra genes so we could select for this chromosome we digested it with enzymes to kill all the proteins and it was pretty stunning when we put this in the cell and you'll appreciate our very sophisticated graphics here the new chromosome went into the cell in fact we thought this might be as far as it went but we tried to design the process a little bit further this is a major mechanism of evolution right here we find all kinds of species that have taken up a second chromosome or a third one from somewhere adding thousands of new traits in a second to that species so people who think of evolution is just one gene change in at a time have missed much of biology there's enzymes called restriction enzymes that actually digest dna the chromosome that was in the cell doesn't have one the chromosome we put in does it get expressed and it recognizes the other chromosome as foreign materials shoot it up and so we ended up just with the cell with the new chromosome it turned blue because of the genes we put in it and with a very short period of time all the characteristics of one species were lost and it converted totally into the new species based on the new software that we put in the cell all the proteins changed the membranes changed when we read the genetic code is exactly what we had transferred in so this may sound like genomic alchemy but we can by moving the software of dna around change things quite dramatically now i've argued this is not genesis this is building on three and a half billion years of evolution and i've argued that we're about to perhaps create a new version of the cambrian explosion where there's massive new speciation based on this digital design why do this i think this is pretty obvious in terms of some of the needs we're about to go from six and a half to nine billion people over the next forty years to put it in contact for myself i was born in nineteen forty six there's now three people on the planet for every one of us that existed in nineteen forty six within forty years there'll before we have trouble feeding providing fresh clean water medicines fuel for the six and a half billion it's going to be stretched to do it for nine we use over five billion tons of coal thirty billion plus barrels of oil that's one hundred million barrels a day when we try to think of biological processes or any process to replace that it's going to be a huge challenge then of course there's all that co two from this material that ends up in the atmosphere we now from our discovery around the world have a database with about twenty million genes and i like to think of these as the design components of the future the electronics industry only had a dozen or so components and look at the diversity that came out of that were limited here primarily by a biological reality and our imagination we now have techniques because of these rapid methods of synthesis to do what we're calling combinatorial genomics we have the ability now to build a large robot that can make a million chromosomes a day when you think of processing these twenty million different genes are trying to optimize processes to produce octane or to produce pharmaceuticals new vaccines we can change just what a small team do more molecular biology than the last twenty years of all science and it's just a standard selection we can select for viability chemical or fuel production vaccine production et cet this is a screen snapshot of some true design a software that we're working on to actually be able to sit down and design species in the computer
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3685162)[0m you know one of the intense pleasures of travel and one of the delights of ethnographic research is the opportunity to live amongst those who have not forgotten the old ways who still feel their past and the wind touch it in stones polished by rain tasted in the bitter leaves of plants just to know that jaguar shamans still journey beyond the milky way or the the myths of the inuit elders still resonate with meaning or that in the himalaya the buddhist still pursue the breath of the darma is to really remember the central revelation of anthropology and that is the idea that the world in which we live in does not exist in some absolute sense but it's just one model of reality the consequence of one particular set of adapt of choices that our lineage made i'll be it successfully many generations ag and of course we all share the same adaptive imperatives we're all born we all bring our children to the world we go through initiation rights we have to deal with the inexible separation of death so it should't surprise us that we all see we all dance we all have art but what's interesting is the unique cadence of the song the rhythm of the dance in every culture and whether it is the panan in the forests of borneo or the vodo atollites in haiti or the warriors in the kissed desert of northern kenya the quandta in the mountains of the andes or a cut of a city in the middle of the sahara this is incidentally the fellow that i traveled into the desert with a month ago or indeed a yakurt in the slopes of chamilunga everest the godmother of the world all of these peoples teach us there are other ways of being other ways of thinking other ways of oringing yourself in the earth and this is an idea that you think about it can only fill you with hope now together the myriad cultures of the world make up a web of spiritual life and cultural life that envelopes the planet as as important to the well being of the planet as indeed as a biological web of life that you know as a biosphere and you might think of this cultural web of life as being an ethnosphere and you might define the ethnosphere as being the some total of all thoughts and dreams ness ideas inspirations intuitions brought to being by the human imagination since the dawn of consciousness the ethnosphere is humanity's great legacy it's a symbol of all that we are and all that we can be as an astonishingly inquisitive species and just as the biosphere is being severely eroded so to as the ethnosphere and if anything at a far greater rate no biologists for example would there suggest that fifty percent of all species are more bender on the brink of extinction because it simply is not true and yet that the most apocalyptic scenario in the realm of biological diversity scarcely approaches what we know to be the most optimistic scenario in the realm of cultural diversity and the great indicator of that of course is language loss when each of you in this room were born there are six thousand languages spoken on the planet now a language is not just a body of vocabulary or set of dramatical rules a language is a flash of the human spirit it's a vehicle through which the soul of each particular culture it comes into the material world every language is an old growth forest of the mind a watershed of thought an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities and of those six thousand languages as we see here today in monterey fully half are no longer being whispered into the ears of children they're no longer being taught to babies which means effectively unless something changes they're already dead what could be more lonely than to be enveloped in silence to be the last of your people to speak your language to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors or anticipate the promise of the children and yet that dreadful fate is indeed the play is somebody somewhere on earth roughly every two weeks because every two weeks some elder dies and carries with them into the grade of the last sybles of an ancient ton and i know there some of you say well wouldn't it be better would the world be a better place if we all justpoke one language and i say great let's make that language your but let's make it cantines let's make it kogi and you'll suddenly discover what it would be like to be unable to speak your own language and so what i'd like to do with you today is to sort of take you on a journey through the ethnosphere a brief journey through the ethnosphere to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost now there are many of us who sort of forget that when i say different ways of being i really do mean different ways of being take for example this child of the barasana northwest amazon people of the anaconda who believe that mythologically they came up the milk rivers in the east and the belly of sacred snakes now this is a people who cognitively do not distinguish the color blue from the color green because the canopy of the heavens is equated to the canopy of the forest upon which the people depend they have a curious language and marriage rule which is called linguistic exogamy you must marry someone who speaks a different language and this is all rooted in mythological past you have the curious things in these long houses where there are six or seven languages spoken because of intermarriage you never hear anyone practicing a language they simply listen and then begin to speak or one of the most fascinating tribes ever lived with the watani of north eastern ecuador and astonishing people first contacted peacefully in nineteen fifty eight and nineteen fifty seven five missionaries attempted contact made a critical mistake they dropped from the air eight by ten glossy photographs of themselves and what we would say to be friendly gestures for getting these people of the rainforest had never seen anything two dimensional in their lives they picked up these photographs on the forest floor tried to look behind the face to fly the form of the figure found nothing and concluded these were calling cards in the devil so they speared the five missionaries to death but the watan didn't just spear outsiders they speared each other fifty four percent of the mortality was to do them spearing each other we traced genealogies backage generations and we found two instances of natural death and when we pressured the people a little bit about it they admitted that one of the fellows had gotten so old that he died getting old so we speared him anyway but at the same time at a postercatious knowledge of the force that was astonishing their hunters could smell animals yearn at forty paces and tell you what species left behind in the early eighties i had a really astonishing assignment when i was asked by my professor at harvard if i was interested in going down to haiti infiltrating the secret societies which were the foundation of devaluous strength and the tota mac and security and the poison used to make zambies in order to make sense of sensation of course i had to understand something about this remarkable faith of medune and buda is not a black magic cult on the contrary it's a complex metaphysical worldview it's interesting if i asked you the name of the great religions of the world what would you say christianity islam buddhism judhism whatever there's always one continent left out is the assumption being that sub saharan africa had no religious belief well of course they did and vod is simply the distallation of these very the found religious ideas that came over during the tragic diosor of the slavery era but what makes vote so interesting is that it's this living relationship between living and the deads the living the birth the spirits the spirits can be invoked from beneath the great water responding to the rhythm of the dance to momentarily displays the soul of the living for that brief shining moment the a light becomes the god that's why the vodouists like to say that the white people go to church and speak about god we dance in the temple and become god and because you are possessed you are taken by a spirit how can you be harmed you see these astonishing demonstrations food acollites in a state of trance handling burning embers with impunity a rather astonishing example of the ability of the mind to affect the body that bears it when catalyzing the state of extreme excitation now of all the peoples that i've ever been with the most extraordinary or the kogi of the sihanovare de senta marka northern columbia the sentants of the ancient tairona civilization which ones corporated the caribbean coastal plane of columbia in the wake of the conquest these people retreated into an isolated volcanic massif that ss above the caribbean coastal plane in a bloodstained continent these people alone were never conquered by a spanish to this day they remain ruled by a ritual priesthood but they're training for the priesthood is rather extraordinary the young aclights are taken away from their families at the age of three and four sequestered in a shadowy world of darkness and stone huts the base of glaciers for eighteen years to nine year periods deliberately chose to mimic the nine months of gestation they spend in their natural mother's mom now they're metaphorically in the home of the great mother and for this entire time they are inculturating into the values of their society values that maintain the proposition of their prayers and their prayers alone maintain the cosmic where we might say the ecological balance and at the end of this amazing initiation one day they're suddenly taken out and for the first time in their lives the age of eighteen they see a sunrise and in that crystal moment of awareness the first light as the sun begins to be the slopes of this stunningly beautiful landscape suddenly everything they have learned in the abstract is a firm and stunning glory and the pre steps back and so you see it's really as i told you it is that beautiful it is yours to protect they call themselves the elder brothers and they say
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3685164)[0m we talked about some of these projects before about the human genome and what that might mean and discovering new sets of genes we're actually starting at a new point we've been digitizing biology and now we're trying to go from that digital code into a new phase of biology with designing and synthesizing life so we've always been trying to ask big questions what is life is something that i think many biologists have been trying to understand at various levels we've tried various approaches paring it down to minimal components we've been digitizing it now for almost twenty years when we sequenced the human genome that was going from the analog world of biology into the digital world of the computer now we're trying to ask can we regenerate life or can we create new life out of this digital universe this is the map of a small organism mycoplasma genitalium that has the smallest genome for a species that can self replicate in the laboratory and we've been trying to just see if we can come up with an even smaller genome we're able to knock out on the order of one hundred genes out of the five hundred or so that are here but when we look at its metabolic map it's relatively simple compared to mars trust me this is simple but when we look at all the genes that we could knock out one at a time it's very unlikely that this would yield a living cell so we decided the only way forward was to actually synthesize this chromosome so we could vary the components to ask some of these most fundamental questions and so we started down the road of can we synthesize a chromosome can chemistry permit making these really large molecules where we've never been before and if we do can we boot up a chromosome the chromosome by the way is just a piece of inner chemical material so our pace of digitizing life has been increasing at an exponential pace our ability to write the genetic code has been moving pretty slowly but has been increasing and our latest point would put it on now on exponential curve we started this over fifteen years ago it took several stages in fact starting with a bioothical review before we did the first experiments but it turns out synthesizing dna is very difficult there's tens of thousands of machines around the world that make small pieces of dna thirty to fifty letters and lengths and it's a degenerate process so the longer would make the piece the more errors there are so we had to create a new method for putting these little pieces together and correct all the errors and this was our first attempt starting with the digital information of the genome of pi x one hundred and seventy four it's a small virus that kills bacteria we designed the pieces and went through our air correction and had a dna molecule of about five thousand letters and the exciting phase when we took this piece of inner chemical and put it in the bacteria and the bacteria started to read this genetic code made the viral particles the viral particles then were released from the cells and came back and killed the e cola i was talking to the oil industry recently and i said they clearly understood that model they left more than you guys all right and so we think this is a situation where the software can actually build its own hardware in a biological system but we wanted to go much larger we wanted to build an entire bacterial chromosome it's over five hundred and eighty thousand letters of genetic code so we thought we'd build them that cassettes the size of the viruses so we could actually vary the cassettes to understand what the actual components of a living cell are design is critical and if you're starting with digital information in the computer that digital information has to be really accurate when we first sequenced this genome in nineteen ninety five the standard of accuracy was one error for ten thousand base pairs we actually found on re sequencing it thirty errors had we used that original sequence it never would have been able to be booted up and part of the design is designing pieces that are fifty letters long that have to overlap with all the other fifty letter pieces to build smaller subunits we have to design so they can go together we design unique elements into this you may have read that we put watermarks in think of this we have a four letter genetic code acg and t triplets of that letters of those letters code for roughly twenty amino acids that there's a single letter designation for each of the immuno acids so we can use the genetic code to write out words sentences thoughts initially all we did was autographic some people were disappointed there was not poetry we designed these pieces so we can just choose back with enzymes there's enzymes that repair them and put them together and we started making pieces starting with pieces that were five to seventh seven thousand letters put those together to make twenty four thousand letter pieces then put sets of those going up to seventy two thousand at each stage we grew up these pieces in abundance so we could sequence them because we're trying to create a process that's extremely robust that you can see in a minute we're trying to get to the point of automation so this looks like a basketball play off when we get into these really large pieces over one hundred thousand base pairs they won't any longer grow readily any cola it exhaust all the modern tools of molecular biology and so we turned to other mechanisms we knew there's a mechanism called homologous recombination that biology uses to repair dna that can put pieces together here's an example of it there's an organism called dinococcus radiodurans that can take three million rads of radiation you can see in the top panel its chromosome just gets blown apart twelve to twenty four hours later it put it back together exactly as it was before we have thousands of organisms that can do this these organisms can be totally desticated they can live in a vacuum i am absolutely certain that life can exist in outer space move around find a new acre environment in fact nasa has shown a lot of this is out there here's an actual micrograph of the molecule we built using these processes actually just using yeast mechanisms with the right design of the pieces we put them in yeast put some together automatically this is not an electron micrograph this is just a regular photo micrograph it's such a large molecule we can see it with a light microscope these are pictures over about a six second period so this is the publication we had just a short while ago this is over five hundred and eighty thousand letters of genetic code it's the largest molecule ever made by humans of a defined structure it's over three hundred million molecular weight if we print it out at a ten font with no spacing it takes one hundred and forty two pages just to print this genetic code well how do we boot up a chromosome how do we activate this obviously with the virus it's pretty simple it's much more complicated dealing with bacteria it's also simpler when you go into eukaryots like ourselves you can just pop out the nucleus and pop in another one and that's what you've all heard about with cloning with bacteria archaea the chromosome is integrated into the cell but we recently showed that we can do a complete transplant of a chromosome from one cell to another and activated we purified a chromosome from one microbial species roughly these tour as distant as human and mice we had a few extra genes so we could select for this chromosome we digested it with enzymes to kill all the proteins and it was pretty stunning when we put this in the cell and you'll appreciate our very sophisticated graphics here the new chromosome went into the cell in fact we thought this might be as far as it went but we tried to design the process a little bit further this is a major mechanism of evolution right here we find all kinds of species that have taken up a second chromosome or a third one from somewhere adding thousands of new traits in a second to that species so people who think of evolution is just one gene change in at a time have missed much of biology there's enzymes called restriction enzymes that actually digest dna the chromosome that was in the cell doesn't have one the chromosome we put in does it get expressed and it recognizes the other chromosome as foreign materials shoot it up and so we ended up just with the cell with the new chromosome it turned blue because of the genes we put in it and with a very short period of time all the characteristics of one species were lost and it converted totally into the new species based on the new software that we put in the cell all the proteins changed the membranes changed when we read the genetic code is exactly what we had transferred in so this may sound like genomic alchemy but we can by moving the software of dna around change things quite dramatically now i've argued this is not genesis this is building on three and a half billion years of evolution and i've argued that we're about to perhaps create a new version of the cambrian explosion where there's massive new speciation based on this digital design why do this i think this is pretty obvious in terms of some of the needs we're about to go from six and a half to nine billion people over the next forty years to put it in contact for myself i was born in nineteen forty six there's now three people on the planet for every one of us that existed in nineteen forty six within forty years there'll before we have trouble feeding providing fresh clean water medicines fuel for the six and a half billion it's going to be stretched to do it for nine we use over five billion tons of coal thirty billion plus barrels of oil that's one hundred million barrels a day when we try to think of biological processes or any process to replace that it's going to be a huge challenge then of course there's all that co two from this material that ends up in the atmosphere we now from our discovery around the world have a database with about twenty million genes and i like to think of these as the design components of the future the electronics industry only had a dozen or so components and look at the diversity that came out of that were limited here primarily by a biological reality and our imagination we now have techniques because of these rapid methods of synthesis to do what we're calling combinatorial genomics we have the ability now to build a large robot that can make a million chromosomes a day when you think of processing these twenty million different genes are trying to optimize processes to produce octane or to produce pharmaceuticals new vaccines we can change just what a small team do more molecular biology than the last twenty years of all science and it's just a standard selection we can select for viability chemical or fuel production vaccine production et cet this is a screen snapshot of some true design a software that we're working on to actually be able to sit down and design species in the computer but you know we don't know necessarily what they look like we know exactly what their genetic code look like we're focusing on now a fourth generation fuels you've seen recently corn ethanol is just a bad experiment we have second and third generation fuels that are becoming out relatively soon that are sugar to much higher value of fuels like aucting or different types of butin al but the only way we think that biology can have a major impact without further increasing the cost of food and liminates availability is if we start with co two as its feedstock and so we're working with designing cells to go down this road and we think we'll have the first fourth generation fuels in about eighteen months sunlight and co two is one method but in our discovery around the world we have all kinds of other methods this is an organism we described in nineteen ninety six it lives in the deep ocean about a mile and a half deep almost at boiling water temperatures it takes co two to methane using molecular hydrogen its energy source we're looking to see if we can take captured co two which can easily be piped to site convert that co two back into fuel to drive this process so in a short period of time we think that we might be able to increase what the basic question is of what is life were truly you know have modest goals of replacing the whole petrochemical industry if you can't do that at ted where can you become a major source of energy but also we're now working on using these same tools to come up with instant sets of vaccines you've seen this year with flu we're always a year behind in a dollar short when it comes to the right vaccine i think that can be changed by building commentatorial vaccines in advance
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3685161)[0m i am my writer writing books is my profession but it's more than that of course it is also my great lifelong love and fascination and i don't expect that that's ever going to change but that said something kind of peculiar has happened recently in my life and in my career which has caused me to have to sort of recalibrate my whole relationship with this work and the peculiar thing is that i recently wrote this book this memoir called a pre love which decidedly unlike any of my previous books went out in the world for some reason and became this big mega sensation international best seller thing the result of which is that everywhere i go now people treat me like i'm doomed seriously doomed they come up to me all worried and they say aren't you afraid aren't you afraid you're never going to be able to top that aren't you afraid you're going to keep writing for your whole life and you're never again going to create a book that anybody in the world cares about at all ever again so that's reassuring you know but it would be worse except for that i happened to remember that over twenty years ago when i first started telling people when i was a teenager that i wanted to be a writer i was met with this same kind of sort of fear based reaction and people would say aren't too afraid you're never going to have any success aren't too afraid the humiliation of rejection will kill you aren't too afraid that you're going to work your whole life at this craft and nothings that are going to come with it you're going to die on a scrap of broken dreams with your mouth filled with bitter ash of failure like that you know and the answer the short answer to all those questions is yes yes i'm afraid of all those things and i always have been and i'm afraid of many many more things besides that you know people can't even guess out like seaweed and other things that are scary but when it comes to writing the thing that i've been sort of thinking about lately and wondering about lately is why you know is it rational is it logical that anybody should be expected to be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this earth to do you know and what is it specifically about creative ventures this seems to make us really nervous about each other's mental health in a way that other careers kind of don't do you know like my dad for example was a chemical engineer i don't recall once in his forty years of chemical engineering anybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer you know it just didn't like that chemical engineering block john you know housical and it just didn't come up like that you know but to be fair right chemical engineers as a group you know haven't really earned a reputation over the centuries for being alcoholic manic depressives and we writers you know we kind of do have that reputation not just writers but creative people across all shores it seems to have this reputation for being enormously mentally unstable and you know all you have to do is look at the very grim death count in the twentieth century alone of really magnificent creative minds who died young and often at their own hands you know and even the ones who didn't literally commit suicide seem to be really undone and by their gifts you know norman mayler just before he died the last interview he said every one of my books has killed me a little more an extraordinary statement to make about your life's work you know but we don't even blink when we hear somebody say this because we've heard that kind of stuff for so long and somehow we've completely internalized and accepted collectively this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow inherently linked and that artistry in the end will always ultimately lead to anguish and the question that i want to ask everybody here today is are you guys all cool with that idea think are you comfortable with that because you look at it even from an inch way and you know i'm not at all comfortable with that assumption i think it's odious and i also think it's dangerous and i don't want to see it perpetuated into the next century i think better if we encourage you know our great creative minds to live you know and i definitely know that in my case in my situation it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of leaking down that dark path of assumption you know particularly given the circumstance that i'm in right now in my career which is you know like check it out i'm pretty young i'm only about forty years old i still have maybe another four decades of work left in me and it's exceedingly likely that anything i write from this point forward is going to be judged by the world as the work that came after the freakish success of my last book i should just go bluntly because we're all sort of friends here now it's exceedingly likely that my greatest success is behind me jesus what a thought like that's the kind of thought that could lead a person to start drinking gin at nine o'clock in the morning and you know i don't want to go there you know i would prefer to keep doing this work that i love and so the question becomes how you know and so it seems to me upon a lot of reflection the way that i have to work now in order to continue writing is that i have to create some sort of protective psychological construct right i have to find some way to have a safe distance you know between me as i am writing and my very natural anxiety about what the reaction to that writing is going to be from now on and as i've been looking over the last year for like models for how to do that i've been sort of looking across time and i've been trying to find like other societies to see if they might have had better and saner ideas than we have about how to help creative people manage the inherent emotional risks of creativity and that search has led me to ancient grease in ancient rome to stay with me because it does circle around back but ancient crease ancient rome people did not happen to believe that creativity came from human beings back then ok people believed that creativity was this divine attendant spirit that came to human beings from some distant and unknowable source for distant and unknowable reasons the greeks famously called these divine attendant spirits of creativity daymens socrates famously believed that he had a dayman who spoke wisdom to him from far the romans had the same idea but they called that sort of disembodied creative spirit a genius which is great because the romans did not actually think that a genius was a particularly clever individual they believe that a genius was the sort of magical divine entity who was believed to literally live in the walls of an artist's studio kind of like doobby the houself and who would come out and invisibly assist the artist with the work and would shape the outcome of that work so brilliant there it is right there at that distance that i'm talking about that psychological construct to protect you from the results of your work you know and everyone knew that this is how it functioned right so the ancient artist was protected from certain things like for example too much narcissism right if your work was brilliant couldn't take all the credit for it everybody knew you had this like disembody genius who had helped you if your work bombed not entirely your fault you know everyone knew your genius was kind of lame and this is how people thought about creativity in the west for a really long time creativity in the west for a really long time and then the renaissance came and everything changed and we had this big idea and the big idea was let's put the individual human being at the center of the universe right above all gods and mysteries and there's no more room for like mystical creatures who take dictation from the divine and it's the beginning of rational humanism and people started to believe that creativity came completely from the self of the individual and for the first time in history you start to hear people referring to this or that artist as being a genius rather than having a genius and i've got to tell you i think that was a huge error you know i think that allowing somebody like one mere person to believe that he or she is like the vessel you know like the font and the essence and the source of all divine creative unknowable eternal mystery is just like a smidge too much responsibility to put on one fragile human psyche it's like asking somebody to swallow the sun you know it just completely warps into sorts egos and it creates all these unmanagable expectations about performance and i think the pressure of that that has been killing off our artists for the last five hundred years and if this is true and i think it is true the question becomes you know what now you know can we do this differently maybe go back to some more ancient understanding about the relationship between humans and the creative mystery maybe not you know maybe we can't just erase five hundred years of rational humanistic thought in one eighteen minutes teach and there's probably people in this audience who would raise like really legitimate scientific suspicions about the notion of basically fairies who follow people around like rubbing fairy juice on their projects and stuff like i'm not probably going to bring you all along with me on this but the question that i kind of want to pose is why not why not think about it this way because it makes as much sense as anything else i have ever heard in terms of explaining the utter maddening capriciousness of the creative process a process which as anybody who has ever tried to make something which is to say as basically everyone here knows does not always behave rationally and in fact can sometimes feel downright paranormal i had this encounter recently where i met the extraordinary american poet ruthstone who's now in her nineties but she's been to poet her entire life and she told me that when she was growing up in rural virginia she would be out working in the fields and she said she would like feel and hear a poem coming at her from over the landscape and she said it was like a thunderous train of error and it would come barreling down at her over the landscape and when she felt it coming because it would like shaped the earth under her feet she knew that she had only one thing to do at that point and that was two in her words runlike hall and she was like runlike hall to the house and she be getting chased by this poem and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pencil fast enough so that when it thundered through her she could collect it and grab it on the page and other times she wouldn't be fast enough so she'd be like running and running running and she wouldn't get to the house and the poem would like barrel through her and she would miss it and she said it would continue on across the landscape looking as she put it for another poet and then there were these times and this is the piece i never forgot she said that there are moments when she would almost miss it right so she's like running in the house and she's looking for the paper and the poem passes through her and she grabs a pencil justice it's going through it and then she said it was like she would reach out with her other hand and she would catch it she'd catch the poem by its tail and she would pull it backwards into her body as she was transcribing on the page and in these instances the poem would come up on the page perfect and intact but backwards from the last word to the first so when i heard that i was like you know that's uncanny that's exactly what my creative process is like it's not at all my creative process i'm not the pipeline you know like i'm a muel and the way that i have to work is that i have to get up at the same time every day like sweat and labor and like barrel through it really awkwardly but even i in my muelishness even i have brushed up against that thing you know at times and i would imagine that a lot of you have to you know like even i have had work our ideas come through me from a source that i honestly cannot identify and what is that thing and how are we to relate to it in a way that will not make us lose our minds but in fact might actually keep us saying and for me the best contemporary example that i have of how to do that is the musician tom waits who i got to interview several years ago on a magazine assignment and we were talking about this and you know you know tom i mean for most of his life he was pretty much the embodiment of the tormented contemporary modern artist you know like trying to control and manage and dominate these sort of uncontrollable creative impulses you know that were totally internalized but then he got older and he got calmer and one day he was driving on the freeway in los angeles he told me and this is when it all changed for him and he's speeding along and all the sudden hears this little fragment of melody you know that comes into his head as inspiration often comes elusive and tentalizing and he wants it you know it's gorgeous and he lungs for it but he has no way to get it he doesn't have a peace paper he doesn't have a pencil he doesn't have a tape recorder
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3685153)[0m i'm going to talk to you about some stuff that's in this book of mind that i hope will resonate with other things that you've already heard and i'll try to make some connections myself in case you miss them but i want to start with what i call the official dogma if you're dogma of what the official dogma of all western industrial societies and the official dog runs like this if we are interested in maximizing the welfare of our citizens the way to do that is to maximize individual freedom the reason for this is both that freedom is in and of itself good valuable worthwhile essential to being human and because if people have freedom then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will maximize our welfare and no one has to decide on our behalf the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice the more choice people have the more freedom they have and the more freedom they have the more welfare they have this i think is so deeply embedded in the water supply that it wouldn't occur to anyone to question it and it's also deeply embedded in our lives i'll give you some examples of what modern progress has made possible for us this is my supermarket not such a big one i want to say just a word about saladdressing one hundred and seventy five saladdressings in my supermarket if you don't count the ten extraversion olive oils and twelve ball samic vinigers you could buy to make a very large number of your own saladdressings in the off chance that none of one hundred and seventy five the store has an offer situ so this is what the supermarket is like and then you go to the consumer electronic store to set up a stereo system speakers cd player tape player tunor amplifier and in this one single consumer electronic store there are that many stereo systems we can construct six and a half million different stereo systems out of the components that are on offer in one store you've got to admit that's a lot of choice in other domains the world of communications there was a time when i was a boy when you could get any kind of telephone service you wanted as long as it came from mob bell you rented your phone you didn't buy it one consequence of that by the way is that the phone never broke and those days are gone we now have an almost unlimited variety of phones especially in the world of cellphones these are cellphones in the future my favorite is the middle one the mp three player nose hair tremor and tremble tort and if if by some chance you haven't seen that in your store yet you can rest assured that one day soon you will and what this does is it leads people to walk into their stores asking this question and do you know what the answer to this question now is the answer is no it is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too much so in other aspects of life that are much more significant than buying things the same explosion of choice is true in healthcare it is no longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you what to do instead you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you what we could do a or we could do b a has these benefits and these risks be has these benefits and these risks what do you want to do and you say doc what should i do and the doc says a has these benefits and risks and has these benefits and risks what do you want to do and you say if you were me doc what would you do and the doc says but i'm not you and the result is we call a patient autonomy which makes it sound like a good thing but what it really is is a shifting of the burden and the responsibility for decision making from somebody who knows something namely the doctor somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sick and us not in the best shape to be making decisions namely the patient there's enormous marketing of prescription drugs to people like you and me which if you think about it makes no sense at all since we can't buy them why do they market to us if we can't buy them the answer is that they expect us to call our doctors the next morning and ask for our prescriptions to be changed something as dramatic as our identity is now become a matter of choice as the slide is meant to indicate we get to we don't inherit an identity we get to invent it and we get to reinvent ourselves as often as we like and that means that every day when you wake up in the morning you have to decide what kind of person you want to be with respect to marriage and family there was a time when the default assumption that almost everyone had is that you got married as soon as you could and then you started having kids as soon as you could the only real choice was who not when and not what you did after nowadays everything is very much up for grabs i teach wonderfully intelligent students and i assigned twenty percent less work than i used to and it's not because they're less smart and it's not because they're less diligent it's because they are preoccupied asking themselves should i get married or not should i get married now should i get married later should i have kids first or a career first all of these are consuming questions and they're going to answer these questions whether or not it means not doing all the work i assign and not getting a good grade in my courses and indeed they should these are important questions to answer work we are blessed as corals pointing out with the technology that enables us to work every minute of every day from any place on the planet except the random hotel there is one corner by the way that i'm not going to tell anybody about where you actually where the wi fi works i'm not telling you about it because i want to use it so what this means this incredible freedom of choice we have with respect to work is that we have to make a decision again and again and again about whether we should or shouldn't be working we can go to watch our kid play soccer and we have our cellphone on one hip and our blackberry on our other hip and our laptop presumably on our laps and even if they're all shut off every minute that we're watching our kid mutilated a soccer game we are also asking ourselves should i answer this cell phone calls should i respond to this email should i drive this letter and even if the answer to the question is no it's certainly going to make the experience of your kid's soccer game very different than it would have been so everywhere we look big things and small things material things and lifestyle things life is a matter of choice and the world we used to live in look like this that is to say there were some choices but not everything was a matter of choice and the world we now live in looks like this and the question is that is this good news or bad news and the answer is yes we all know what's good about it so i'm going to talk about what's bad about it all this choice has two effects two negative effects on people one effect paradoxically is that it produces paralysis rather than liberation with so many options to choose from people find it very difficult to choose at all i'll give you one very dramatic example of this a study that was done of investments in voluntary retirement plans a colleague of mine got access to investment records from vanguard the gigantic mutual fund company of about a million employees in about two thousand different workplaces and what she found is that but for every ten mutual funds the employer offered rate of participation went down two percent you offer fifty funds ten percent fewer employees participate than if you only offer five why because with fifty funds to choose from it's so damn hard to decide which fund to choose that you'll just put it off to tomorrow and then tomorrow and then tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow and of course tomorrow never comes understand that not only does this mean that people are going to have to eat dog food when they retire because they don't have enough money put away it also means that making the decisions so hard that they pass up significant matching money from the employer by not participating they are passing up as much as five thousand dollars a year from the employer who would happily match their contribution so paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices and i think it makes the world look like this you really want to get the decision right if it's for all eternity right you don't want to pick the wrong mutual fund or even the wrong saladress so that's one effect the second effect is that even if we manage to overcome the paralysis and make a choice we end up less satisfied with the result of the choice than we would be if we have fewer options to choose from and there are several reasons for this one of them is that with a lot of different sal addressings to choose from if you buy one and it's not perfect and you know what sal addressing is it's easy to imagine that you could have made a different choice that would have been better and what happens is this imagined alternative induces you to regret the decision you made and this regrets subtracts from the satisfacts and you get out of the decision you made even if it was a good decision the more options there are the easier it is to regret anything at all that is disappointing about the option that you chose second what economists call opportunity costs dan gilbert made a big point this morning of talking about how how much the way in which we value things depends on what we compare them to well when there are lots of alternatives to consider it is easy to imagine the attractive features of alternatives that you reject that make you less satisfied with the alternative that you've chosen here's an example for those of you who are new yorkers i apologize but here's what you're supposed to be thinking here's this couple on the hamptons very expensive real estate gorgeous beach beautiful day they have it all to themselves what could be better well dammit this guy is thinking it's august everybody in my manhattan neighborhood is a way i could be parking right in front of my building and he spends two weeks nagged by the idea that he is missing the opportunity day after day to have a great parking space the opportunity costs subtract from the satisfaction we get out of what we choose even when what we choose is terrific and the more options there are to consider the more attractive features of these options are going to be reflected by us as opportunity costs here's another example now this cartoon makes a lot of points it makes points about living in the moment as well and probably about doing things slowly but one point it makes is that whenever you're choosing one thing you're choosing not to do other things and those other things may have lots of attractive features and it's going to make what you're doing less attractive third escalation of expectations this hit me when i went to replace my genes i wear genes almost all the time and there was a time when genes came in one flavor and you bought them and they fit like crap and they were incredibly uncomfortable and if you wear them along enough and wash them enough times they started to fit feel ok so i went to replace my genes after years and years of wearing these old ones and i said i you know going to pair genes there's my size on the shop keeper said do you want slim fit easy fit relaxed fit you want button fly or zipper fly you want stone wash or acid wash you want them distressed you want boot cut you want tapered blah blah blah on it and he went my jaw dropped and after i recovered i said i want the kind that used to be the only kind so he had no idea what that was so i spent an hour trying on all these damn genes and i walked out of the store truth with the best fitting genes i had ever had i did better all this choice made it possible for me to do better but i felt worse why were a whole book to try to explain this to myself the reason is the reason i felt worse is that with all of these options available my expectations about how good a pair genes should be went up i had very low x i had no particular expectations when they only came into one flavor when they came at one hundred flavors damn one of them should have been perfect and what i got was good but it wasn't perfect and so i compared what i got to what i expected and what i got was disappointing in comparison to what i expected adding options to people's lives we can't help but increase the expectations people have about how good those options will be and what that's going to produce is less satisfaction with results even when they're good results nobody in the world marketing knows this because if they did you wouldn't all know what this was about the truth is more like this the reason that everything was better back when everything was worse is that when everything was worse it was actually possible for people to have experiences that were a pleasant surprise nowadays the world we live in we affluent industrialized citizens with perfection the expectation the best you can ever hope for is that such stuff is as good as you expect it to be you will never be pleasantly surprised because your expectations my expectations have gone through the roof the secret to happiness this is what you all came for the secret to happiness is low expectations i want to say just a little autobiographical moment that i actually married to a wife and she's really quite wonderful i couldn't have done better i didn't settle but settling isn't always such a bad thing finally one consequence of buying a bad fitting pair of genes when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are dissatisfied and you ask why who's responsible the answer is clear the world is responsible what could you do when there are hundreds of different styles of genes available and you buy one that is disappointing and you ask why who's responsible it is equally clear that the answer to the question is you you could have done better without with one hundred different kinds of genes on display there is no excuse for failure and so when people make decisions and even the results of the decisions are good they feel disappointed about them they blame themselves clinical depression has exploded in the industrial world in the last generation i believe a significant not the only but a significant contributor to this explosion of depression and also suicide is that people have experiences that are disappointing because their standards are so high and then when they have to explain these experiences to themselves they think they're at fault and so the net result is that we do better in general objectively and we feel worse so let me remind you this is the official dogma the one that we all take to be true and it's all false it is not true there's no question that some choice is better than none but it doesn't follow from that that more choice is better than some choice there's some magical amount i don't know what it is i'm pretty confident that we have long since past the point where options improve our welfare now as a policy matter i'm almost done as a policy matter the thing to think about is this what enables all of this choice in industrial societies is material affluence there are lots of places in the world and we have heard about several of them where their problem is not that they have too much choice their problem is that they have too little so the stuff i'm talking about is the peculiar problem of modern affluent western societies and what is so frustrating and infuriating is this steve love talked to you yesterday about how these expensive and difficult to install but infants child seeds don't help it's a waste of money what i'm telling you is that these expensive complicated choices it's not simply that they don't help they actually hurt they actually make us worse
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3685153)[0m i'm going to talk to you about some stuff that's in this book of mind that i hope will resonate with other things that you've already heard and i'll try to make some connections myself in case you miss them but i want to start with what i call the official dogma if you're dogma of what the official dogma of all western industrial societies and the official dog runs like this if we are interested in maximizing the welfare of our citizens the way to do that is to maximize individual freedom the reason for this is both that freedom is in and of itself good valuable worthwhile essential to being human and because if people have freedom then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will maximize our welfare and no one has to decide on our behalf the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice the more choice people have the more freedom they have and the more freedom they have the more welfare they have this i think is so deeply embedded in the water supply that it wouldn't occur to anyone to question it and it's also deeply embedded in our lives i'll give you some examples of what modern progress has made possible for us this is my supermarket not such a big one i want to say just a word about saladdressing one hundred and seventy five saladdressings in my supermarket if you don't count the ten extraversion olive oils and twelve ball samic vinigers you could buy to make a very large number of your own saladdressings in the off chance that none of one hundred and seventy five the store has an offer situ so this is what the supermarket is like and then you go to the consumer electronic store to set up a stereo system speakers cd player tape player tunor amplifier and in this one single consumer electronic store there are that many stereo systems we can construct six and a half million different stereo systems out of the components that are on offer in one store you've got to admit that's a lot of choice in other domains the world of communications there was a time when i was a boy when you could get any kind of telephone service you wanted as long as it came from mob bell you rented your phone you didn't buy it one consequence of that by the way is that the phone never broke and those days are gone we now have an almost unlimited variety of phones especially in the world of cellphones these are cellphones in the future my favorite is the middle one the mp three player nose hair tremor and tremble tort and if if by some chance you haven't seen that in your store yet you can rest assured that one day soon you will and what this does is it leads people to walk into their stores asking this question and do you know what the answer to this question now is the answer is no it is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too much so in other aspects of life that are much more significant than buying things the same explosion of choice is true in healthcare it is no longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you what to do instead you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you what we could do a or we could do b a has these benefits and these risks be has these benefits and these risks what do you want to do and you say doc what should i do and the doc says a has these benefits and risks and has these benefits and risks what do you want to do and you say if you were me doc what would you do and the doc says but i'm not you and the result is we call a patient autonomy which makes it sound like a good thing but what it really is is a shifting of the burden and the responsibility for decision making from somebody who knows something namely the doctor somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sick and us not in the best shape to be making decisions namely the patient there's enormous marketing of prescription drugs to people like you and me which if you think about it makes no sense at all since we can't buy them why do they market to us if we can't buy them the answer is that they expect us to call our doctors the next morning and ask for our prescriptions to be changed something as dramatic as our identity is now become a matter of choice as the slide is meant to indicate we get to we don't inherit an identity we get to invent it and we get to reinvent ourselves as often as we like and that means that every day when you wake up in the morning you have to decide what kind of person you want to be with respect to marriage and family there was a time when the default assumption that almost everyone had is that you got married as soon as you could and then you started having kids as soon as you could the only real choice was who not when and not what you did after nowadays everything is very much up for grabs i teach wonderfully intelligent students and i assigned twenty percent less work than i used to and it's not because they're less smart and it's not because they're less diligent it's because they are preoccupied asking themselves should i get married or not should i get married now should i get married later should i have kids first or a career first all of these are consuming questions and they're going to answer these questions whether or not it means not doing all the work i assign and not getting a good grade in my courses and indeed they should these are important questions to answer work we are blessed as corals pointing out with the technology that enables us to work every minute of every day from any place on the planet except the random hotel there is one corner by the way that i'm not going to tell anybody about where you actually where the wi fi works i'm not telling you about it because i want to use it so what this means this incredible freedom of choice we have with respect to work is that we have to make a decision again and again and again about whether we should or shouldn't be working we can go to watch our kid play soccer and we have our cellphone on one hip and our blackberry on our other hip and our laptop presumably on our laps and even if they're all shut off every minute that we're watching our kid

[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3685161)[0m i am my writer writing books is my profession but it's more than that of course it is also my great lifelong love and fascination and i don't expect that that's ever going to change but that said something kind of peculiar has happened recently in my life and in my career which has caused me to have to sort of recalibrate my whole relationship with this work and the peculiar thing is that i recently wrote this book this memoir called a pre love which decidedly unlike any of my previous books went out in the world for some reason and became this big mega sensation international best seller thing the result of which is that everywhere i go now people treat me like i'm doomed seriously doomed they come up to me all worried and they say aren't you afraid aren't you afraid you're never going to be able to top that aren't you afraid you're going to keep writing for your whole life and you're never again going to create a book that anybody in the world cares about at all ever again so that's reassuring you know but it would be worse except for that i happened to remember that over twenty years ago when i first started telling people when i was a teenager that i wanted to be a writer i was met with this same kind of sort of fear based reaction and people would say aren't too afraid you're never going to have any success aren't too afraid the humiliation of rejection will kill you aren't too afraid that you're going to work your whole life at this craft and nothings that are going to come with it you're going to die on a scrap of broken dreams with your mouth filled with bitter ash of failure like that you know and the answer the short answer to all those questions is yes yes i'm afraid of all those things and i always have been and i'm afraid of many many more things besides that you know people can't even guess out like seaweed and other things that are scary but when it comes to writing the thing that i've been sort of thinking about lately and wondering about lately is why you know is it rational is it logical that anybody should be expected to be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this earth to do you know and what is it specifically about creative ventures this seems to make us really nervous about each other's mental health in a way that other careers kind of don't do you know like my dad for example was a chemical engineer i don't recall once in his forty years of chemical engineering anybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer you know it just didn't like that chemical engineering block john you know housical and it just didn't come up like that you know but to be fair right chemical engineers as a group you know haven't really earned a reputation over the centuries for being alcoholic manic depressives and we writers you know we kind of do have that reputation not just writers but creative people across all shores it seems to have this reputation for being enormously mentally unstable and you know all you have to do is look at the very grim death count in the twentieth century alone of really magnificent creative minds who died young and often at their own hands you know and even the ones who didn't literally commit suicide seem to be really undone and by their gifts you know norman mayler just before he died the last interview he said every one of my books has killed me a little more an extraordinary statement to make about your life's work you know but we don't even blink when we hear somebody say this because we've heard that kind of stuff for so long and somehow we've completely internalized and accepted collectively this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow inherently linked and that artistry in the end will always ultimately lead to anguish and the question that i want to ask everybody here today is are you guys all cool with that idea think are you comfortable with that because you look at it even from an inch way and you know i'm not at all comfortable with that assumption i think it's odious and i also think it's dangerous and i don't want to see it perpetuated into the next century i think better if we encourage you know our great creative minds to live you know and i definitely know that in my case in my situation it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of leaking down that dark path of assumption you know particularly given the circumstance that i'm in right now in my career which is you know like check it out i'm pretty young i'm only about forty years old i still have maybe another four decades of work left in me and it's exceedingly likely that anything i write from this point forward is going to be judged by the world as the work that came after the freakish success of my last book i should just go bluntly because we're all sort of friends here now it's exceedingly likely that my greatest success is behind me jesus what a thought like that's the kind of thought that could lead a person to start drinking gin at nine o'clock in the morning and you know i don't want to go there you know i would prefer to keep doing this work that i love and so the question becomes how you know and so it seems to me upon a lot of reflection the way that i have to work now in order to continue writing is that i have to create some sort of protective psychological construct right i have to find some way to have a safe distance you know between me as i am writing and my very natural anxiety about what the reaction to that writing is going to be from now on and as i've been looking over the last year for like models for how to do that i've been sort of looking across time and i've been trying to find like other societies to see if they might have had better and saner ideas than we have about how to help creative people manage the inherent emotional risks of creativity and that search has led me to ancient grease in ancient rome to stay with me because it does circle around back but ancient crease ancient rome people did not happen to believe that creativity came from human beings back then ok people believed that creativity was this divine attendant spirit that came to human beings from some distant and unknowable source for distant and unknowable reasons the greeks famously called these divine attendant spirits of creativity daymens socrates famously believed that he had a dayman who spoke wisdom to him from far the romans had the same idea but they called that sort of disembodied creative spirit a genius which is great because the romans did not actually think that a genius was a particularly clever individual they believe that a genius was the sort of magical divine entity who was believed to literally live in the walls of an artist's studio kind of like doobby the houself and who would come out and invisibly assist the artist with the work and would shape the outcome of that work so brilliant there it is right there at that distance that i'm talking about that psychological construct to protect you from the results of your work you know and everyone knew that this is how it functioned right so the ancient artist was protected from certain things like for example too much narcissism right if your work was brilliant couldn't take all the credit for it everybody knew you had this like disembody genius who had helped you if your work bombed not entirely your fault you know everyone knew your genius was kind of lame and this is how people thought about creativity in the west for a really long time creativity in the west for a really long time and then the renaissance came and everything changed and we had this big idea and the big idea was let's put the individual human being at the center of the universe right above all gods and mysteries and there's no more room for like mystical creatures who take dictation from the divine and it's the beginning of rational humanism and people started to believe that creativity came completely from the self of the individual and for the first time in history you start to hear people referring to this or that artist as being a genius rather than having a genius and i've got to tell you i think that was a huge error you know i think that allowing somebody like one mere person to believe that he or she is like the vessel you know like the font and the essence and the source of all divine creative unknowable eternal mystery is just like a smidge too much responsibility to put on one fragile human psyche it's like asking somebody to swallow the sun you know it just completely warps into sorts egos and it creates all these unmanagable expectations about performance and i think the pressure of that that has been killing off our artists for the last five hundred years and if this is true and i think it is true the question becomes you know what now you know can we do this differently maybe go back to some more ancient understanding about the relationship between humans and the creative mystery maybe not you know maybe we can't just erase five hundred years of rational humanistic thought in one eighteen minutes teach and there's probably people in this audience who would raise like really legitimate scientific suspicions about the notion of basically fairies who follow people around like rubbing fairy juice on their projects and stuff like i'm not probably going to bring you all along with me on this but the question that i kind of want to pose is why not why not think about it this way because it makes as much sense as anything else i have ever heard in terms of explaining the utter maddening capriciousness of the creative process a process which as anybody who has ever tried to make something which is to say as basically everyone here knows does not always behave rationally and in fact can sometimes feel downright paranormal i had this encounter recently where i met the extraordinary american poet ruthstone who's now in her nineties but she's been to poet her entire life and she told me that when she was growing up in rural virginia she would be out working in the fields and she said she would like feel and hear a poem coming at her from over the landscape and she said it was like a thunderous train of error and it would come barreling down at her over the landscape and when she felt it coming because it would like shaped the earth under her feet she knew that she had only one thing to do at that point and that was two in her words runlike hall and she was like runlike hall to the house and she be getting chased by this poem and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pencil fast enough so that when it thundered through her she could collect it and grab it on the page and other times she wouldn't be fast enough so she'd be like running and running running and she wouldn't get to the house and the poem would like barrel through her and she would miss it and she said it would continue on across the landscape looking as she put it for another poet and then there were these times and this is the piece i never forgot she said that there are moments when she would almost miss it right so she's like running in the house and she's looking for the paper and the poem passes through her and she grabs a pencil justice it's going through it and then she said it was like she would reach out with her other hand and she would catch it she'd catch the poem by its tail and she would pull it backwards into her body as she was transcribing on the page and in these instances the poem would come up on the page perfect and intact but backwards from the last word to the first so when i heard that i was like you know that's uncanny that's exactly what my creative process is like it's not at all my creative process i'm not the pipeline you know like i'm a muel and the way that i have to work is that i have to get up at the same time every day like sweat and labor and like barrel through it really awkwardly but even i in my muelishness even i have brushed up against that thing you know at times and i would imagine that a lot of you have to you know like even i have had work our ideas come through me from a source that i honestly cannot identify and what is that thing and how are we to relate to it in a way that will not make us lose our minds but in fact might actually keep us saying and for me the best contemporary example that i have of how to do that is the musician tom waits who i got to interview several years ago on a magazine assignment and we were talking

[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3685161)[0m i am my writer writing books is my profession but it's more than that of course it is also my great lifelong love and fascination and i don't expect that that's ever going to change but that said something kind of peculiar has happened recently in my life and in my career which has caused me to have to sort of recalibrate my whole relationship with this work and the peculiar thing is that i recently wrote this book this memoir called a pre love which decidedly unlike any of my previous books went out in the world for some reason and became this big mega sensation international best seller thing the result of which is that everywhere i go now people treat me like i'm doomed seriously doomed they come up to me all worried and they say aren't you afraid aren't you afraid you're never going to be able to top that aren't you afraid you're going to keep writing for your whole life and you're never again going to create a book that anybody in the world cares about at all ever again so that's reassuring you know but it would be worse except for that i happened to remember that over twenty years ago when i first started telling people when i was a teenager that i wanted to be a writer i was met with this same kind of sort of fear based reaction and people would say aren't too afraid you're never going to have any success aren't too afraid the humiliation of rejection will kill you aren't too afraid that you're going to work your whole life at this craft and nothings that are going to come with it you're going to die on a scrap of broken dreams with your mouth filled with bitter ash of failure like that you know and the answer the short answer to all those questions is yes yes i'm afraid of all those things and i always have been and i'm afraid of many many more things besides that you know people can't even guess out like seaweed and other things that are scary but when it comes to writing the thing that i've been sort of thinking about lately and wondering about lately is why you know is it rational is it logical that anybody should be expected to be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this earth to do you know and what is it specifically about creative ventures this seems to make us really nervous about each other's mental health in a way that other careers kind of don't do you know like my dad for example was a chemical engineer i don't recall once in his forty years of chemical engineering anybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer you know it just didn't like that chemical engineering block john you know housical and it just didn't come up like that you know but to be fair right chemical engineers as a group you know haven't really earned a reputation over the centuries for being alcoholic manic depressives and we writers you know we kind of do have that reputation not just writers but creative people across all shores it seems to have this reputation for being enormously mentally unstable and you know all you have to do is look at the very grim death count in the twentieth century alone of really magnificent creative minds who died young and often at their own hands you know and even the ones who didn't literally commit suicide seem to be really undone and by their gifts you know norman mayler just before he died the last interview he said every one of my books has killed me a little more an extraordinary statement to make about your life's work you know but we don't even blink when we hear somebody say this because we've heard that kind of stuff for so long and somehow we've completely internalized and accepted collectively this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow inherently linked and that artistry in the end will always ultimately lead to anguish and the question that i want to ask everybody here today is are you guys all cool with that idea think are you comfortable with that because you look at it even from an inch way and you know i'm not at all comfortable with that assumption i think it's odious and i also think it's dangerous and i don't want to see it perpetuated into the next century i think better if we encourage you know our great creative minds to live you know and i definitely know that in my case in my situation it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of leaking down that dark path of assumption you know particularly given the circumstance that i'm in right now in my career which is you know like check it out i'm pretty young i'm only about forty years old i still have maybe another four decades of work left in me and it's exceedingly likely that anything i write from this point forward is going to be judged by the world as the work that came after the freakish success of my last book i should just go bluntly because we're all sort of friends here now it's exceedingly likely that my greatest success is behind me jesus what a thought like that's the kind of thought that could lead a person to start drinking gin at nine o'clock in the morning and you know i don't want to go there you know i would prefer to keep doing this work that i love and so the question becomes how you know and so it seems to me upon a lot of reflection the way that i have to work now in order to continue writing is that i have to create some sort of protective psychological construct right i have to find some way to have a safe distance you know between me as i am writing and my very natural anxiety about what the reaction to that writing is going to be from now on and as i've been looking over the last year for like models for how to do that i've been sort of looking across time and i've been trying to find like other societies to see if they might have had better and saner ideas than we have about how to help creative people manage the inherent emotional risks of creativity and that search has led me to ancient grease in ancient rome to stay with me because it does circle around back but ancient crease ancient rome people did not happen to believe that creativity came from human beings back then ok people believed that creativity was this divine attendant spirit that came to human beings from some distant and unknowable source for distant and unknowable reasons the greeks famously called these divine attendant spirits of creativity daymens socrates famously believed that he had a dayman who spoke wisdom to him from far the romans had the same idea but they called that sort of disembodied creative spirit a genius which is great because the romans did not actually think that a genius was a particularly clever individual they believe that a genius was the sort of magical divine entity who was believed to literally live in the walls of an artist's studio kind of like doobby the houself and who would come out and invisibly assist the artist with the work and would shape the outcome of that work so brilliant there it is right there at that distance that i'm talking about that psychological construct to protect you from the results of your work you know and everyone knew that this is how it functioned right so the ancient artist was protected from certain things like for example too much narcissism right if your work was brilliant couldn't take all the credit for it everybody knew you had this like disembody genius who had helped you if your work bombed not entirely your fault you know everyone knew your genius was kind of lame and this is how people thought about creativity in the west for a really long time creativity in the west for a really long time and then the renaissance came and everything changed and we had this big idea and the big idea was let's put the individual human being at the center of the universe right above all gods and mysteries and there's no more room for like mystical creatures who take dictation from the divine and it's the beginning of rational humanism and people started to believe that creativity came completely from the self of the individual and for the first time in history you start to hear people referring to this or that artist as being a genius rather than having a genius and i've got to tell you i think that was a huge error you know i think that allowing somebody like one mere person to believe that he or she is like the vessel you know like the font and the essence and the source of all divine creative unknowable eternal mystery is just like a smidge too much responsibility to put on one fragile human psyche it's like asking somebody to swallow the sun you know it just completely warps into sorts egos and it creates all these unmanagable expectations about performance and i think the pressure of that that has been killing off our artists for the last five hundred years and if this is true and i think it is true the question becomes you know what now you know can we do this differently maybe go back to some more ancient understanding about the relationship between humans and the creative mystery maybe not you know maybe we can't just erase five hundred years of rational humanistic thought in one eighteen minutes teach and there's probably people in this audience who would raise like really legitimate scientific suspicions about the notion of basically fairies who follow people around like rubbing fairy juice on their projects and stuff like i'm not probably going to bring you all along with me on this but the question that i kind of want to pose is why not why not think about it this way because it makes as much sense as anything else i have ever heard in terms of explaining the utter maddening capriciousness of the creative process a process which as anybody who has ever tried to make something which is to say as basically everyone here knows does not always behave rationally and in fact can sometimes feel downright paranormal i had this encounter recently where i met the extraordinary american poet ruthstone who's now in her nineties but she's been to poet her entire life and she told me that when she was growing up in rural virginia she would be out working in the fields and she said she would like feel and hear a poem coming at her from over the landscape and she said it was like a thunderous train of error and it would come barreling down at her over the landscape and when she felt it coming because it would like shaped the earth under her feet she knew that she had only one thing to do at that point and that was two in her words runlike hall and she was like runlike hall to the house and she be getting chased by this poem and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pencil fast enough so that when it thundered through her she could collect it and grab it on the page and other times she wouldn't be fast enough so she'd be like running and running running and she wouldn't get to the house and the poem would like barrel through her and she would miss it and she said it would continue on across the landscape looking as she put it for another poet and then there were these times and this is the piece i never forgot she said that there are moments when she would almost miss it right so she's like running in the house and she's looking for the paper and the poem passes through her and she grabs a pencil justice it's going through it and then she said it was like she would reach out with her other hand and she would catch it she'd catch the poem by its tail and she would pull it backwards into her body as she was transcribing on the page and in these instances the poem would come up on the page perfect and intact but backwards from the last word to the first so when i heard that i was like you know that's uncanny that's exactly what my creative process is like it's not at all my creative process i'm not the pipeline you know like i'm a muel and the way that i have to work is that i have to get up at the same time every day like sweat and labor and like barrel through it really awkwardly but even i in my muelishness even i have brushed up against that thing you know at times and i would imagine that a lot of you have to you know like even i have had work our ideas come through me from a source that i honestly cannot identify and what is that thing and how are we to relate to it in a way that will not make us lose our minds but in fact might actually keep us saying and for me the best contemporary example that i have of how to do that is the musician tom waits who i got to interview several years ago on a magazine assignment and we were talking about this and you know you know tom i mean for most of his life he was pretty much the embodiment of the tormented contemporary modern artist you know like trying to control and manage and dominate these sort of uncontrollable creative impulses you know that were totally internalized but then he got older and he got calmer and one day he was driving on the freeway in los angeles he told me and this is when it all changed for him and he's speeding along and all the sudden hears this little fragment of melody you know that comes into his head as inspiration often comes elusive and tentalizing and he wants it you know it's gorgeous and he lungs for it but he has no way to get it he doesn't have a peace paper he doesn't have a pencil he doesn't have a tape recorder so he starts to feel all that old anxiety starts to rise on him like i'm going to lose this thing you know and i'm going to be hunted by this sum forever and i'm not good enough and i can't do it and instead of panicking he just stopped he just stopped that whole mental process and he did something completely novel he just looked up at the sky and he said excuse me can you not see that i'm driving do i look like i can write down a song right now you know if you really want to exist come back at a more opportune moment when i can take care of you otherwise go bother somebody else today go bother leonard coin you know and his whole work process changed after that not the work the work was still oftentimes as dark as ever you know but the process and the heavy anxiety around it was released when he took the gene the genius out of him where it was causing nothing but trouble and released it kind of backward it came from and realized that this didn't have to be this internalized tormented thing it could be this peculiar wondrous bizarre collaboration kind of conversation between tom and the strange external thing that was not quite tom so when i heard that story it started to shift a little bit the way that i worked too and it already saved me once this idea it saved me when i was in the middle of writing eat pray love and i fell into one of those sort of pits of despair that we all fall into and we're working on something that's not coming and you start to think this is going to be a disaster this is going to be the worst book ever not just but but the worst book ever written and i sort of think i should just dump this project you know but then i remembered tom talking to the open air and i tried it so i just lifted my face up from the manuscript and i directed my comments to an empty corner of the room and i said allowed listen to you thing

going to keep writing anyway because that's my job and i would please like the record to reflect today that i showed up for my part of the job because in the end it's like this okay centuries ago in the deserts of north africa people used to gather for these moonlight dances of sacred dance and music that would go on for hours and hours until dawn and they were always magnificent because the dancers were professionals and they were terrific right but every once in a while very rarely something would happen and one of these performers would actually become transcendent and i know you know what i'm talking about because i know you've all seen at some point in your life a performance like this you know and it was like time would stop and the dancer was sort of step through some kind of portal and he wasn't doing anything different than he had ever done you know a thousand lines before but everything little line and all of a sudden he would no longer appear to be nearly human you know he would be lit from within and lit from below and all like lit up on fire with divinity and when this happened back then people knew it for what it was you know they called it by its name they would put their hands together and they would start to chant

their own hands you know and even the ones who didn't literally commit suicide seem to be really undone and by their gifts you know norman mayler just before he died the last interview he said every one of my books has killed me a little more an extraordinary statement to make about your life's work you know but we don't even blink when we hear somebody say this because we've heard that kind of stuff for so long and somehow we've completely internalized and accepted collectively this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow inherently linked and that artistry in the end will always ultimately lead to anguish and the question that i want to ask everybody here today is are you guys all cool with that idea think are you comfortable with that because you look at it even from an inch way and you know i'm not at all comfortable with that assumption i think it's odious and i also think it's dangerous and i don't want to see it perpetuated into the next century i think better if we encourage you know our great creative minds to live you know and i definitely know that in my case in my situation it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of leaking down that dark path of assumption you know particularly given the circumstance that i'm in right now in my career which is you know like check it out i'm pretty young i'm only about forty years old i still have maybe another four decades of work left in me and it's exceedingly likely that anything i write from this point forward is going to be judged by the world as the work that came after the freakish success of my last book i should just go bluntly because we're all sort of friends here now it's exceedingly likely that my greatest success is behind me jesus what a thought like that's the kind of thought that could lead a person to start drinking gin at nine o'clock in the morning and you know i don't want to go there you know i would prefer to keep doing this work that i love and so the question becomes how you know and so it seems to me upon a lot of reflection the way that i have to work now in order to continue writing is that i have to create some sort of protective psychological construct right i have to find some way to have a safe distance you know between me as i am writing and my very natural anxiety about what the reaction to that writing is going to be from now on and as i've been looking over the last year for like models for how to do that i've been sort of looking across time and i've been trying to find like other societies to see if they might have had better and saner ideas than we have about how to help creative people manage the inherent emotional risks of creativity and that search has led me to ancient grease in ancient rome to stay with me because it does circle around back but ancient crease ancient rome people did not happen to believe that creativity came from human beings back then ok people believed that creativity was this divine attendant spirit that came to human beings from some distant and unknowable source for distant and unknowable reasons the greeks famously called these divine attendant spirits of creativity daymens socrates famously believed that he had a dayman who spoke wisdom to him from far the romans had the same idea but they called that sort of disembodied creative spirit a genius which is great because the romans did not actually think that a genius was a particularly clever individual they believe that a genius was the sort of magical divine entity who was believed to literally live in the walls of an artist's studio kind of like doobby the houself and who would come out and invisibly assist the artist with the work and would shape the outcome of that work so brilliant there it is right there at that distance that i'm talking about that psychological construct to protect you from the results of your work you know and everyone knew that this is how it functioned right so the ancient artist was protected from certain things like for example too much narcissism right if your work was brilliant couldn't take all the credit for it everybody knew you had this like disembody genius who had helped you if your work bombed not entirely your fault you know everyone knew your genius was kind of lame and this is how people thought about creativity in the west for a really long time creativity in the west for a really long time and then the renaissance came and everything changed and we had this big idea and the big idea was let's put the individual human being at the center of the universe right above all gods and mysteries and there's no more room for like mystical creatures who take dictation from the divine and it's the beginning of rational humanism and people started to believe that creativity came completely from the self of the individual and for the first time in history you start to hear people referring to this or that artist as being a genius rather than having a genius and i've got to tell you i think that was a huge error you know i think that allowing somebody like one mere person to believe that he or she is like the vessel you know like the font and the essence and the source of all divine creative unknowable eternal mystery is just like a smidge too much responsibility to put on one fragile human psyche it's like asking somebody to swallow the sun you know it just completely warps into sorts egos and it creates all these unmanagable expectations about performance and i think the pressure of that that has been killing off our artists for the last five hundred years and if this is true and i think it is true the question becomes you know what now you know can we do this differently maybe go back to some more ancient understanding about the relationship between humans and the creative mystery maybe not you know maybe we can't just erase five hundred years of rational humanistic thought in one eighteen minutes teach and there's probably people in this audience who would raise like really legitimate scientific suspicions about the notion of basically fairies who follow people around like rubbing fairy juice on their projects and stuff like i'm not probably going to bring you all along with me on this but the question that i kind of want to pose is why not why not think about it this way because it makes as much sense as anything else i have ever heard in terms of explaining the utter maddening capriciousness of the creative process a process which as anybody who has ever tried to make something which is to say as basically everyone here knows does not always behave rationally and in fact can sometimes feel downright paranormal i had this encounter recently where i met the extraordinary american poet ruthstone who's now in her nineties but she's been to poet her entire life and she told me that when she was growing up in rural virginia she would be out working in the fields and she said she would like feel and hear a poem coming at her from over the landscape and she said it was like a thunderous train of error and it would come barreling down at her over the landscape and when she felt it coming because it would like shaped the earth under her feet she knew that she had only one thing to do at that point and that was two in her words runlike hall and she was like runlike hall to the house and she be getting chased by this poem and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pencil fast enough so that when it thundered through her she could collect it and grab it on the page and other times she wouldn't be fast enough so she'd be like running and running running and she wouldn't get to the house and the poem would like barrel through her and she would miss it and she said it would continue on across the landscape looking as she put it for another poet and then there were these times and this is the piece i never forgot she said that there are moments when she would almost miss it right so she's like running in the house and she's looking for the paper and the poem passes through her and she grabs a pencil justice it's going through it and then she said it was like she would reach out with her other hand and she would catch it she'd catch the poem by its tail and she would pull it backwards into her body as she was transcribing on the page and in these instances the poem would come up on the page perfect and intact but backwards from the last word to the first so when i heard that i was like you know that's uncanny that's exactly what my creative process is like it's not at all my creative process i'm not the pipeline you know like i'm a muel and the way that i have to work is that i have to get up at the same time every day like sweat and labor and like barrel through it really awkwardly but even i in my muelishness even i have brushed up against that thing you know at times and i would imagine that a lot of you have to you know like even i have had work our ideas come through me from a source that i honestly cannot identify and what is that thing and how are we to relate to it in a way that will not make us lose our minds but in fact might actually keep us saying and for me the best contemporary example that i have of how to do that is the musician tom waits who i got to interview several years ago on a magazine assignment and we were talking about this and you know you know tom i mean for most of his life he was pretty much the embodiment of the tormented contemporary modern artist you know like trying to control and manage and dominate these sort of uncontrollable creative impulses you know that were totally internalized but then he got older and he got calmer and one day he was driving on the freeway in los angeles he told me and this is when it all changed for him and he's speeding along and all the sudden hears this little fragment of melody you know that comes into his head as inspiration often comes elusive and tentalizing and he wants it you know it's gorgeous and he lungs for it but he has no way to get it he doesn't have a peace paper he doesn't have a pencil he doesn't have a tape recorder so he starts to feel all that old anxiety starts to rise on him like i'm going to lose this thing you know and i'm going to be hunted by this sum forever and i'm not good enough and i can't do it and instead of panicking he just stopped he just stopped that whole mental process and he did something completely novel he just looked up at the sky and he said excuse me can you not see that i'm driving do i look like i can write down a song right now you know if you really want to exist come back at a more opportune moment when i can take care of you otherwise go bother somebody else today go bother leonard coin you know and his whole work process changed after that not the work the work was still oftentimes as dark as ever you know but the process and the heavy anxiety around it was released when he took the gene the genius out of him where it was causing nothing but trouble and released it kind of backward it came from and realized that this didn't have to be this internalized tormented thing it could be this peculiar wondrous bizarre collaboration kind of conversation between tom and the strange external thing that was not quite tom so when i heard that story it started to shift a little bit the way that i worked too and it already saved me once this idea it saved me when i was in the middle of writing eat pray love and i fell into one of those sort of pits of despair that we all fall into and we're working on something that's not coming and you start to think this is going to be a disaster this is going to be the worst book ever not just but but the worst book ever written and i sort of think i should just dump this project you know but then i remembered tom talking to the open air and i tried it so i just lifted my face up from the manuscript and i directed my comments to an empty corner of the room and i said allowed listen to you thing you and i both know that if this book isn't brilliant that is not entirely my fault right because you can see that i am putting everything i have into this you know i don't have any more than this so if you want to be better then you've got to show up and do your part of the deal ok but if you don't do that you know at the hell of it i'm going to keep writing anyway because that's my job and i would please like the record to reflect today that i showed up for my part of the job because in the end it's like this okay centuries ago in the deserts of north africa people used to gather for these moonlight dances of sacred dance and music that would go on for hours and hours until dawn and they were always magnificent because the dancers were professionals and they were terrific right but every once in a while very rarely something would happen and one of these performers would actually become transcendent and i know you know what i'm talking about because i know you've all seen at some point in your life a performance like this you know and it was like time would stop and the dancer was sort of step through some kind of portal and he wasn't doing anything different than he had ever done you know a thousand lines before but everything little line and all of a sudden he would no longer appear to be nearly human you know he would be lit from within and lit from below and all like lit up on fire with divinity and when this happened back then people knew it for what it was you know they called it by its name they would put their hands together and they would start to chant ah lah ah lah ah lah god god god god you know a curious historical footnote when the moores invaded southern spain they took this custom with them and the pronunciation changed over the centuries from ala ala to a lay a lay a lay which you still hear in both fights and inflao dances in spain when a performer has done something impossible and magic ala a lay a lay ala magnificent bravo incomprehensible there it is a glimpse of god which is great because we need that but the tricky bit comes the next morning right for the dancer himself when he wakes up and discovers that it's tuesday eleven a m and he's no longer a glimpse of god he's just an aging mortal with really bad needs and maybe he's never going to ascend to that height again and maybe nobody will ever
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3685161)[0m i am my writer writing books is my profession but it's more than that of course it is also my great lifelong love and fascination and i don't expect that that's ever going to change but that said something kind of peculiar has happened recently in my life and in my career which has caused me to have to sort of recalibrate my whole relationship with this work and the peculiar thing is that i recently wrote this book this memoir called a pre love which decidedly unlike any of my previous books went out in the world for some reason and became this big mega sensation international best seller thing the result of which is that everywhere i go now people treat me like i'm doomed seriously doomed they come up to me all worried and they say aren't you afraid aren't you afraid you're never going to be able to top that aren't you afraid you're going to keep writing for your whole life and you're never again going to create a book that anybody in the world cares about at all ever again so that's reassuring you know but it would be worse except for that i happened to remember that over twenty years ago when i first started telling people when i was a teenager that i wanted to be a writer i was met with this same kind of sort of fear based reaction and people would say aren't too afraid you're never going to have any success aren't too afraid the humiliation of rejection will kill you aren't too afraid that you're going to work your whole life at this craft and nothings that are going to come with it you're going to die on a scrap of broken dreams with your mouth filled with bitter ash of failure like that you know and the answer the short answer to all those questions is yes yes i'm afraid of all those things and i always have been and i'm afraid of many many more things besides that you know people can't even guess out like seaweed and other things that are scary but when it comes to writing the thing that i've been sort of thinking about lately and wondering about lately is why you know is it rational is it logical that anybody should be expected to be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this earth to do you know and what is it specifically about creative ventures this seems to make us really nervous about each other's mental health in a way that other careers kind of don't do you know like my dad for example was a chemical engineer i don't recall once in his forty years of chemical engineering anybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer you know it just didn't like that chemical engineering block john you know housical and it just didn't come up like that you know but to be fair right chemical engineers as a group you know haven't really earned a reputation over the

could lead a person to start drinking gin at nine o'clock in the morning and you know i don't want to go there you know i would prefer to keep doing this work that i love and so the question becomes how you know and so it seems to me upon a lot of reflection the way that i have to work now in order to continue writing is that i have to create some sort of protective psychological construct right i have to find some way to have a safe distance you know between me as i am writing and my very natural anxiety about what the reaction to that writing is going to be from now on and as i've been looking over the last year for like models for how to do that i've been sort of looking across time and i've been trying to find like other societies to see if they might have had better and saner ideas than we have about how to help creative people manage the inherent emotional risks of creativity and that search has led me to ancient grease in ancient rome to stay with me because it does circle around back but ancient crease ancient rome people did not happen to believe that creativity came from human beings back then ok people believed that creativity was this divine attendant spirit that came to human beings from some distant and unknowable source for distant and unknowable reasons the greeks famously called these divine attendant spirits of creativity daymens socrates famously believed that he had a dayman who spoke wisdom to him from far the romans had the same idea but they called that sort of disembodied creative spirit a genius which is great because the romans did not actually think that a genius was a particularly clever individual they believe that a genius was the sort of magical divine entity who was believed to literally live in the walls of an artist's studio kind of like doobby the houself and who would come out and invisibly assist the artist with the work and would shape the outcome of that work so brilliant there it is right there at that distance that i'm talking about that psychological construct to protect you from the results of your work you know and everyone knew that this is how it functioned right so the ancient artist was protected from certain things like for example too much narcissism right if your work was brilliant couldn't take all the credit for it everybody knew you had this like disembody genius who had helped you if your work bombed not entirely your fault you know everyone knew your genius was kind of lame and this is how people thought about creativity in the west for a really long time creativity in the west for a really long time and then the renaissance came and everything changed and we had this big idea and the big idea was let's put the individual human being at the center of the universe right above all gods and mysteries and there's no more room for like mystical creatures who take dictation from the divine and it's the beginning of rational humanism and people started to believe that creativity came completely from the self of the individual and for the first time in history you start to hear people referring to this or that artist as being a genius rather than having a genius and i've got to tell you i think that was a huge error you know i think that allowing somebody like one mere person to believe that he or she is like the vessel you know like the font and the essence and the source of all divine creative unknowable eternal mystery is just like a smidge too much responsibility to put on one fragile human psyche it's like asking somebody to swallow the sun you know it just completely warps into sorts egos and it creates all these unmanagable expectations about performance and i think the pressure of that that has been killing off our artists for the last five hundred years and if this is true and i think it is true the question becomes you know what now you know can we do this differently maybe go back to some more ancient understanding about the relationship between humans and the creative mystery maybe not you know maybe we can't just erase five hundred years of rational humanistic thought in one eighteen minutes teach and there's probably people in this audience who would raise like really legitimate scientific suspicions about the notion of basically fairies who follow people around like rubbing fairy juice on their projects and stuff like i'm not probably going to bring you all along with me on this but the question that i kind of want to pose is why not why not think about it this way because it makes as much sense as anything else i have ever heard in terms of explaining the utter maddening capriciousness of the creative process a process which as anybody who has ever tried to make something which is to say as basically everyone here knows does not always behave rationally and in fact can sometimes feel downright paranormal i had this encounter recently where i met the extraordinary american poet ruthstone who's now in her nineties but she's been to poet her entire life and she told me that when she was growing up in rural virginia she would be out working in the fields and she said she would like feel and hear a poem coming at her from over the landscape and she said it was like a thunderous train of error and it would come barreling down at her over the landscape and when she felt it coming because it would like shaped the earth under her feet she knew that she had only one thing to do at that point and that was two in her words runlike hall and she was like runlike hall to the house and she be getting chased by this poem and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pencil fast enough so that when it thundered through her she could collect it and grab it on the page and other times she wouldn't be fast enough so she'd be like running and running running and she wouldn't get to the house and the poem would like barrel through her and she would miss it and she said it would continue on across the landscape looking as she put it for another poet and then there were these times and this is the piece i never forgot she said that there are moments when she would almost miss it right so she's like running in the house and she's looking for the paper and the poem passes through her and she grabs a pencil justice it's going through it and then she said it was like she would reach out with her other hand and she would catch it she'd catch the poem by its tail and she would pull it backwards into her body as she was transcribing on the page and in these instances the poem would come up on the page perfect and intact but backwards from the last word to the first so when i heard that i was like you know that's uncanny that's exactly what my creative process is like it's not at all my creative process i'm not the pipeline you know like i'm a muel and the way that i have to work is that i have to get up at the same time every day like sweat and labor and like barrel through it really awkwardly but even i in my muelishness even i have brushed up against that thing you know at times and i would imagine that a lot of you have to you know like even i have had work our ideas come through me from a source that i honestly cannot identify and what is that thing and how are we to relate to it in a way that will not make us lose our minds but in fact might actually keep us saying and for me the best contemporary example that i have of how to do that is the musician tom waits who i got to interview several years ago on a magazine assignment and we were talking about this and you know you know tom i mean for most of his life he was pretty much the embodiment of the tormented contemporary modern artist you know like trying to control and manage and dominate these sort of uncontrollable creative impulses you know that were totally internalized but then he got older and he got calmer and one day he was driving on the freeway in los angeles he told me and this is when it all changed for him and he's speeding along and all the sudden hears this little fragment of melody you know that comes into his head as inspiration often comes elusive and tentalizing and he wants it you know it's gorgeous and he lungs for it but he has no way to get it he doesn't have a peace paper he doesn't have a pencil he doesn't have a tape recorder so he starts to feel all that old anxiety starts to rise on him like i'm going to lose this thing you know and i'm going to be hunted by this sum forever and i'm not good enough and i can't do it and instead of panicking he just stopped he just stopped that whole mental process and he did something completely novel he just looked up at the sky and he said excuse me can you not see that i'm driving do i look like i can write down a song right now you know if you really want to exist come back at a more opportune moment when i can take care of you otherwise go bother somebody else today go bother leonard coin you know and his whole work process changed after that not the work the work was still oftentimes as dark as ever you know but the process and the heavy anxiety around it was released when he took the gene the genius out of him where it was causing nothing but trouble and released it kind of backward it came from and realized that this didn't have to be this internalized tormented thing it could be this peculiar wondrous bizarre collaboration kind of conversation between tom and the strange external thing that was not quite tom so when i heard that story it started to shift a little bit the way that i worked too and it already saved me once this idea it saved me when i was in the middle of writing eat pray love and i fell into one of those sort of pits of despair that we all fall into and we're working on something that's not coming and you start to think this is going to be a disaster this is going to be the worst book ever not just but but the worst book ever written and i sort of think i should just dump this project you know but then i remembered tom talking to the open air and i tried it so i just lifted my face up from the manuscript and i directed my comments to an empty corner of the room and i said allowed listen to you thing you and i both know that if this book isn't brilliant that is not entirely my fault right because you can see that i am putting everything i have into this you know i don't have any more than this so if you want to be better then you've got to show up and do your part of the deal ok but if you don't do that you know at the hell of it i'm going to keep writing anyway because that's my job and i would please like the record to reflect today that i showed up for my part of the job because in the end it's like this okay centuries ago in the deserts of north africa people used to gather for these moonlight dances of sacred dance and music that would go on for hours and hours until dawn and they were always magnificent because the dancers were professionals and they were terrific right but every once in a while very rarely something would happen and one of these performers would actually become transcendent and i know you know what i'm talking about because i know you've all seen at some point in your life a performance like this you know and it was like time would stop and the dancer was sort of step through some kind of portal and he wasn't doing anything different than he had ever done you know a thousand lines before but everything little line and all of a sudden he would no longer appear to be nearly human you know he would be lit from within and lit from below and all like lit up on fire with divinity and when this happened back then people knew it for what it was you know they called it by its name they would put their hands together and they would start to chant ah lah ah lah ah lah god god god god you know a curious historical footnote when the moores invaded southern spain they took this custom with them and the pronunciation changed over the centuries from ala ala to a lay a lay a lay which you still hear in both fights and inflao dances in spain when a performer has done something impossible and magic ala a lay a lay ala magnificent bravo incomprehensible there it is a glimpse of god which is great because we need that but the tricky bit comes the next morning right for the dancer himself when he wakes up and discovers that it's tuesday eleven a m and he's no longer a glimpse of god he's just an aging mortal with really bad needs and maybe he's never going to ascend to that height again and maybe nobody will ever which god's name again as he spends and what is he then to do with the rest of his life this is hard this is one of the most painful reconciliations to make in a creative life you know but maybe it doesn't have to be quite so full of anguish if you never happened to believe in the first place that the most extraordinary aspects of your being came from you but maybe if you just believe that they were unlown to you you know from some unimaginable source for some exquisite portion of your life to be passed along when you're finished with somebody else and you know if we think about it this way it starts to change everything you know this is how i've started to think and this is certainly how i was thinking about it in the last few months you know as i've been working on the book that will soon be published as the dangerously frighteningly over anticipated follow up to my freakish success and what i have to keep telling my myself when i get really psyched out about that is don't be afraid don't be daunted just do your job
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3685162)[0m you know one of the intense pleasures of travel and one of the delights of ethnographic research is the opportunity to live amongst those who have not forgotten the old ways who still feel their past and the wind touch it in stones polished by rain tasted in the bitter leaves of plants just to know that jaguar shamans still journey beyond the milky way or the the myths of the inuit elders still resonate with meaning or that in the himalaya the buddhist still pursue the breath of the darma is to really remember the central revelation of anthropology and that is the idea that the world in which we live in does not exist in some absolute sense but it's just one model of reality the consequence of one particular set of adapt of choices that our lineage made i'll be it successfully many generations ag and of course we all share the same adaptive imperatives we're all born we all bring our children to the world we go through initiation rights we have to deal with the inexible separation of death so it should't surprise us that we all see we all dance we all have art but what's interesting is the unique cadence of the song the rhythm of the dance in every culture and whether it is the panan in the forests of borneo or the vodo atollites in haiti or the warriors in the kissed desert of northern kenya the quandta in the mountains of the andes or a cut of a city in the middle of the sahara this is incidentally the fellow that i traveled into the desert with a month ago or indeed a yakurt in the slopes of chamilunga everest the godmother of the world all of these peoples teach us there are other ways of being other ways of thinking other ways of oringing yourself in the earth and this is an idea that you think about it can only fill you with hope now together the myriad cultures of the world make up a web of spiritual life and cultural life that envelopes the planet as as important to the well being of the planet as indeed as a biological web of life that you know as a biosphere and you might think of this cultural web of life as being an ethnosphere and you might define the ethnosphere as being the some total of all thoughts and dreams ness ideas inspirations intuitions brought to being by the human imagination since the dawn of consciousness the ethnosphere is humanity's great legacy it's a symbol of all that we are and all that we can be as an astonishingly inquisitive species and just as the biosphere is being severely eroded so to as the ethnosphere and if anything at a far greater rate no biologists for example would there suggest that fifty percent of all species are more bender on the brink of extinction because it simply is not true and yet that the most apocalyptic scenario in the realm of biological diversity scarcely approaches what we know to be the most optimistic scenario in the realm of cultural diversity and the great indicator of that of course is language loss when each of you in this room were born there are six thousand languages spoken on the planet now a language is not just a body of vocabulary or set of dramatical rules a language is a flash of the human spirit it's a vehicle through which the soul of each particular culture it comes into the material world every language is an old growth forest of the mind a watershed of thought an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities and of those six thousand languages as we see here today in monterey fully half are no longer being whispered into the ears of children they're no longer being taught to babies which means effectively unless something changes they're already dead what could be more lonely than to be enveloped in silence to be the last of your people to speak your language to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors or anticipate the promise of the children and yet that dreadful fate is indeed the play is somebody somewhere on earth roughly every two weeks because every two weeks some elder dies and carries with them into the grade of the last sybles of an ancient ton and i know there some of you say well wouldn't it be better would the world be a better place if we all justpoke one language and i say great let's make that language your but let's make it cantines let's make it kogi and you'll suddenly discover what it would be like to be unable to speak your own language and so what i'd like to do with you today is to sort of take you on a journey through the ethnosphere a brief journey through the ethnosphere to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost now there are many of us who sort of forget that when i say different ways of being i really do mean different ways of being take for example this child of the barasana northwest amazon people of the anaconda who believe that mythologically they came up the milk rivers in the east and the belly of sacred snakes now this is a people who cognitively do not distinguish the color blue from the color green because the canopy of the heavens is equated to the canopy of the forest upon which the people depend they have a curious language and marriage rule which is called linguistic exogamy you must marry someone who speaks a different language and this is all rooted in mythological past you have the curious things in these long houses where there are six or seven languages spoken because of intermarriage you never hear anyone practicing a language they simply listen and then begin to speak or one of the most fascinating tribes ever lived with the watani of north eastern ecuador and astonishing people first contacted peacefully in nineteen fifty eight and nineteen fifty seven five missionaries attempted contact made a critical mistake they dropped from the air eight by ten glossy photographs of themselves and what we would say to be friendly gestures for getting these people of the rainforest had never seen anything two dimensional in their lives they picked up these photographs on the forest floor tried to look behind the face to fly the form of the figure found nothing and concluded these were calling cards in the devil so they speared the five missionaries to death but the watan didn't just spear outsiders they speared each other fifty four percent of the mortality was to do them spearing each other we traced genealogies backage generations and we found two instances of natural death and when we pressured the people a little bit about it they admitted that one of the fellows had gotten so old that he died getting old so we speared him anyway but at the same time at a postercatious knowledge of the force that was astonishing their hunters could smell animals yearn at forty paces and tell you what species left behind in the early eighties i had a really astonishing assignment when i was asked by my professor at harvard if i was interested in going down to haiti infiltrating the secret societies which were the foundation of devaluous strength and the tota mac and security and the poison used to make zambies in order to make sense of sensation of course i had to understand something about this remarkable faith of medune and buda is not a black magic cult on the contrary it's a complex metaphysical worldview it's interesting if i asked you the name of the great religions of the world what would you say christianity islam buddhism judhism whatever there's always one continent left out is the assumption being that sub saharan africa had no religious belief well of course they did and vod is simply the distallation of these very the found religious ideas that came over during the tragic diosor of the slavery era but what makes vote so interesting is that it's this living relationship between living and the deads the living the birth the spirits the spirits can be invoked from beneath the great water responding to the rhythm of the dance to momentarily displays the soul of the living for that brief shining moment the a light becomes the god that's why the vodouists like to say that the white people go to church and speak about god we dance in the temple and become god and because you are possessed you are taken by a spirit how can you be harmed you see these astonishing demonstrations food acollites in a state of trance handling burning embers with impunity a rather astonishing example of the ability of the mind to affect the body that bears it when catalyzing the state of extreme excitation now of all the peoples that i've ever been with the most extraordinary or the kogi of the sihanovare de senta marka northern columbia the sentants of the ancient tairona civilization which ones corporated the caribbean coastal plane of columbia in the wake of the conquest these people retreated into an isolated volcanic massif that ss above the caribbean coastal plane in a bloodstained continent these people alone were never conquered by a spanish to this day they remain ruled by a ritual priesthood but they're training for the priesthood is rather extraordinary the young aclights are taken away from their families at the age of three and four sequestered in a shadowy world of darkness and stone huts the base of glaciers for eighteen years to nine year periods deliberately chose to mimic the nine months of gestation they spend in their natural mother's mom now they're metaphorically in the home of the great mother and for this entire time they are inculturating into the values of their society values that maintain the proposition of their prayers and their prayers alone maintain the cosmic where we might say the ecological balance and at the end of this amazing initiation one day they're suddenly taken out and for the first time in their lives the age of eighteen they see a sunrise and in that crystal moment of awareness the first light as the sun begins to be the slopes of this stunningly beautiful landscape suddenly everything they have learned in the abstract is a firm and stunning glory and the pre steps back and so you see it's really as i told you it is that beautiful it is yours to protect they call themselves the elder brothers and they say we who are the younger brothers are the ones responsible for destroying the world now this level of intuition becomes very important whenever we think of indigenous people in landscape we either invoke who's so in the old car of rino the noble savage which is an idea racist into simplicity or alternatively we invoke fero and so these people are closer to the earth and we are well indigenous people are neither sentimental nor week and by astalgia there's not a lot of room for either in the malarial swamp of the asthmat where the chilling winds of tibet but they have nevertheless through time and ritual forage the traditional mistake of the earth that is based not an idea of being self consciously close to it but on a far subtler intuition the idea that the earth itself can only exist because it has breathed into being by human consciousness now what does that mean it means that a young kid from the andes who's raised to believe that that mountain is an apple spirit that will direct his or her destiny will be a profoundly different human being and have a different relationship to that resource or that place that a young kid from montana raised to believe that a mountains a pile of raw ready to be mind whether it's a boot of a spirit or a pile of or is irrelevant what's interesting is a metaphor that definds a relationship between the individual and the natural world i was raised in the force the british columbia to believe those force existed to be cut that made me a different human being and my friends amongst the quails who believe that those forces were the abode of hokok and the crooked beak of heaven and the cannable spirits that dwelled to the north end of the world spirits they would have to engage during their homita initiation now if you begin to look at the idea that these cultures could create different realities you can begin to understand some of their extraordinary discoveries take this plant here a photograph i took in the northwest amazon just last april this is alaska which many of you have heard about the most powerful psychoactive the preparation of the shaman's repertoire what makes aoca fascinating is not the sure pharmacological potential of this preparation but the elaboration of it it's made really of two different sources on the one hand this woody leona which has into a series of beta carbolans harming harmly and mildly hallucingenic to take the vine alone is rather to have sort of blue hazey smoke drift across your consciousness but it's mixed with leaves of a shrub in the coffee family called psychoatria veardis this plant has in it some very powerful trip to mean it's very close to brain serotonin diamethal trip to mean five methoxy diamethal trip to mean if you've ever seen the yamami blowing that snuff up their noses that that substance they make from a different set of species it also contains five methoxy diameter trip i mean to have that powder blowing up your nose is rather like being shot out of a riful barrow line with broke paintings and landing on the sea of electricity it doesn't it doesn't cranky it doesn't the distortion of reality it creates the disillusion of reality in fact i used to argue with my professor richard am schultes who is a man who sparked this psychedelic era with his discovery of the magic mushrooms in mexico in the nineteen thirties i used to argue that you couldn't classify these trip to means as lucinogenic because by the time you're under the effects there's no in home anymore to experience lucination but the thing about trick means is they cannot be taken orally because they're denatured by an enzyme found naturally in the human gut called monor monoxidays they can only be taken orally taken in conjunction with some other chemical that denatures emo now the faciting thing is that the beta carbolans found within that leona are mao inhibitors of the precise sort necessary to potentiate the trip to means so you ask yourself a question how in a flora of eighty thousand species of vascular plants that these people find these two morphologically unrelated plants that when combined in this way created a kind of biochemical version of the whole being grid in some of the parts well we use that great euphemism trial and error which is exposed to be meaningless but you ask the indians and they say that plants talk to us well what does that mean this tribe the kofan has seventeen varieties of aaska all of which they distinguish a great distance in the forest all of which are referable to our eye as one species and then you ask them how they establish your taxonomy and they say didn't i thought you know something about plants i mean don't you know anything i have to know well it turns out you take each of the seventeen varieties on the night of a full moon and it sings to you in a different key now that's not going to get your ph d at harvard but it's a lot more interesting in counting statements now the problem the problem is that even those of us sympathetic with applied indigenous people view them as quaint and colorful but somehow reduce to the margins of history as a real world meaning our world moves on well the truth is the twentieth century three hundred years from now it's not going to be remembered for its wars or its technological innovations but rather the air in which we stood by and either actively endorsed or passively accepted the massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity on the planet now the problem isn't change all cultures through all time have constant being engaged in a dance with new possibilities of life and the problem is not technology itself the swinians did not stop being suen they gave up the bone arrow any more than american stop being american we gave up the horse and buggy it's not change or technology that threatens the integrity of the ethnosphere it is power the crude face of domination and whenever you look around the world you discover that these are not cultures destined to fade away these are dynamic living peoples being driven on its existence by identifiable forces that are beyond their capacity to adapt to whether it's the egregious deforestation in the homeland of the panan a nomadic people from southeast asia from sarawa a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago and now have all been reduced to servitude in prostitution on the banks of the rivers where you can see the river itself is soiled with the silt that seems to be carrying half of borne away to the sea china sea where the japanese freighters hang light in the horizon ready to fill their holds with raw logs rip from the forest or in the case of the animami it's a disease entities that have come in in the wake of the discovery of gold or if we go into the mountain of tibet where i'm doing a lot of research recently you'll see it's a crude face of political domination no genocide the physical extinction of a people is universally condowned but ethnicide the destruction of a people's way of life is not only not condemned it's universally in many quarters celebrated as part of a development strategy and you cannot understand the pain of tibet until you move through it at the ground level i once traveled six thousand miles from chindu and western china over land through southeastern tibet to lhasa with a young colleague and it was only when i got to lhasa that i understood the face behind the statistics you hear about six thousand sacred monuments torn apart to dust and ashes one point two million people killed by the cadrator in the cultural revolution this young man's father had been described for the pain lama that meant he was instantly killed at the time of the chinese invasion his uncle fled with his holiness in the diaspora that took the people to nepal his mother was incarcerated for the price for the crime of being wealthy he was smuggled into the jail at the age of two to hide beneath her skirt tail becausehe couldn't barely be without him the sister had done that brave deed was put into an education camp one day she'd invertently stepped on an armband of mo and for that transgression she was given seven years of hard labor the pain of tibet can be impossible to bear but the redentive spirit of the people is something to behold and in the end then it really comes down to a choice do we want to live in a monochromatic world of monotany where do we want to embrace a polychromatic world of diversity margaret me the great anthropologist said beforece you died the greatest sphere that was that as we drifted toward this blandly morphist generic worldview not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination reduced to a more narrow and more narrow modality of thought but that we would wake for a dream one day having forgotten that there were even other possibilities and it's humbly to remember that our species has perhaps been around for six hundred thousand years the neolithic revolution which gave us agriculture at which time we succumbed to the cult of the seed the poetry of the shaman was displaced by the prose of the priesthood we created hierarchy specialization surplus is only ten thousand years ago the modern industrial world as we know it is barely three hundred years old now that shallow history doesn't suggest to me that we have all the answers for all of the challenges that will confront us in the ensuing millennia when these myriad cultures of the world are asked the meaning of being human they respond with ten thousand different voices and it's within that song that we will all rediscover the possibility of being what we are a fully conscious species fully aware of ensuring that all peoples in all gardens find a way to flourish and there are great moments of optimism this is a photograph i took at the northern tip of bafin island when i went narvel hunting with some inuit people and this man or told me a marvelous story of his grandfather the canadian government has not always been kind of the inuit people and during the nineteen fifties to establish her sovereignty we forced them into settlements this old man grandfather refused to go the family fearful for his life took away all of his weapons all of his tools

language and so what i'd like to do with you today is to sort of take you on a journey through the ethnosphere a brief journey through the ethnosphere to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost now there are many of us who sort of forget that when i say different ways of being i really do mean different ways of being take for example this child of the barasana northwest amazon people of the anaconda who believe that mythologically they came up the milk rivers in the east and the belly of sacred snakes now this is a people who cognitively do not distinguish the color blue from the color green because the canopy of the heavens is equated to the canopy of the forest upon which the people depend they have a curious language and marriage rule which is called linguistic exogamy you must marry someone who speaks a different language and this is all rooted in mythological past you have the curious things in these long houses where there are six or seven languages spoken because of intermarriage you never hear anyone practicing a language they simply listen and then begin to speak or one of the most fascinating tribes ever lived with the watani of north eastern ecuador and astonishing people first contacted peacefully in nineteen fifty eight and nineteen fifty seven five missionaries attempted contact made a critical mistake they dropped from the air eight by ten glossy photographs of themselves and what we would say to be friendly gestures for getting these people of the rainforest had never seen anything two dimensional in their lives they picked up these photographs on the forest floor tried to look behind the face to fly the form of the figure found nothing and concluded these were calling cards in the devil so they speared the five missionaries to death but the watan didn't just spear outsiders they speared each other fifty four percent of the mortality was to do them spearing each other we traced genealogies backage generations and we found two instances of natural death and when we pressured the people a little bit about it they admitted that one of the fellows had gotten so old that he died getting old so we speared him anyway but at the same time at a postercatious knowledge of the force that was astonishing their hunters could smell animals yearn at forty paces and tell you what species left behind in the early eighties i had a really astonishing assignment when i was asked by my professor at harvard if i was interested in going down to haiti infiltrating the secret societies which were the foundation of devaluous strength and the tota mac and security and the poison used to make zambies in order to make sense of sensation of course i had to understand something about this remarkable faith of medune and buda is not a black magic cult on the contrary it's a complex metaphysical worldview it's interesting if i asked you the name of the great religions of the world what would you say christianity islam buddhism judhism whatever there's always one continent left out is the assumption being that sub saharan africa had no religious belief well of course they did and vod is simply the distallation of these very the found religious ideas that came over during the tragic diosor of the slavery era but what makes vote so interesting is that it's this living relationship between living and the deads the living the birth the spirits the spirits can be invoked from beneath the great water responding to the rhythm of the dance to momentarily displays the soul of the living for that brief shining moment the a light becomes the god that's why the vodouists like to say that the white people go to church and speak about god we dance in the temple and become god and because you are possessed you are taken by a spirit how can you be harmed you see these astonishing demonstrations food acollites in a state of trance handling burning embers with impunity a rather astonishing example of the ability of the mind to affect the body that bears it when catalyzing the state of extreme excitation now of all the peoples that i've ever been with the most extraordinary or the kogi of the sihanovare de senta marka northern columbia the sentants of the ancient tairona civilization which ones corporated the caribbean coastal plane of columbia in the wake of the conquest these people retreated into an isolated volcanic massif that ss above the caribbean coastal plane in a bloodstained continent these people alone were never conquered by a spanish to this day they remain ruled by a ritual priesthood but they're training for the priesthood is rather extraordinary the young aclights are taken away from their families at the age of three and four sequestered in a shadowy world of darkness and stone huts the base of glaciers for eighteen years to nine year periods deliberately chose to mimic the nine months of gestation they spend in their natural mother's mom now they're metaphorically in the home of the great mother and for this entire time they are inculturating into the values of their society values that maintain the proposition of their prayers and their prayers alone maintain the cosmic where we might say the ecological balance and at the end of this amazing initiation one day they're suddenly taken out and for the first time in their lives the age of eighteen they see a sunrise and in that crystal moment of awareness the first light as the sun begins to be the slopes of this stunningly beautiful landscape suddenly everything they have learned in the abstract is a firm and stunning glory and the pre steps back and so you see it's really as i told you it is that beautiful it is yours to protect they call themselves the elder brothers and they say we who are the younger brothers are the ones responsible for destroying the world now this level of intuition becomes very important whenever we think of indigenous people in landscape we either invoke who's so in the old car of rino the noble savage which is an idea racist into simplicity or alternatively we invoke fero and so these people are closer to the earth and we are well indigenous people are neither sentimental nor week and by astalgia there's not a lot of room for either in the malarial swamp of the asthmat where the chilling winds of tibet but they have nevertheless through time and ritual forage the traditional mistake of the earth that is based not an idea of being self consciously close to it but on a far subtler intuition the idea that the earth itself can only exist because it has breathed into being by human consciousness now what does that mean it means that a young kid from the andes who's raised to believe that that mountain is an apple spirit that will direct his or her destiny will be a profoundly different human being and have a different relationship to that resource or that place that a young kid from montana raised to believe that a mountains a pile of raw ready to be mind whether it's a boot of a spirit or a pile of or is irrelevant what's interesting is a metaphor that definds a relationship between the individual and the natural world i was raised in the force the british columbia to believe those force existed to be cut that made me a different human being and my friends amongst the quails who believe that those forces were the abode of hokok and the crooked beak of heaven and the cannable spirits that dwelled to the north end of the world spirits they would have to engage during their homita initiation now if you begin to look at the idea that these cultures could create different realities you can begin to understand some of their extraordinary discoveries take this plant here a photograph i took in the northwest amazon just last april this is alaska which many of you have heard about the most powerful psychoactive the preparation of the shaman's repertoire what makes aoca fascinating is not the sure pharmacological potential of this preparation but the elaboration of it it's made really of two different sources on the one hand this woody leona which has into a series of beta carbolans harming harmly and mildly hallucingenic to take the vine alone is rather to have sort of blue hazey smoke drift across your consciousness but it's mixed with leaves of a shrub in the coffee family called psychoatria veardis this plant has in it some very powerful trip to mean it's very close to brain serotonin diamethal trip to mean five methoxy diamethal trip to mean if you've ever seen the yamami blowing that snuff up their noses that that substance they make from a different set of species it also contains five methoxy diameter trip i mean to have that powder blowing up your nose is rather like being shot out of a riful barrow line with broke paintings and landing on the sea of electricity it doesn't it doesn't cranky it doesn't the distortion of reality it creates the disillusion of reality in fact i used to argue with my professor richard am schultes who is a man who sparked this psychedelic era with his discovery of the magic mushrooms in mexico in the nineteen thirties i used to argue that you couldn't classify these trip to means as lucinogenic because by the time you're under the effects there's no in home anymore to experience lucination but the thing about trick means is they cannot be taken orally because they're denatured by an enzyme found naturally in the human gut called monor monoxidays they can only be taken orally taken in conjunction with some other chemical that denatures emo now the faciting thing is that the beta carbolans found within that leona are mao inhibitors of the precise sort necessary to potentiate the trip to means so you ask yourself a question how in a flora of eighty thousand species of vascular plants that these people find these two morphologically unrelated plants that when combined in this way created a kind of biochemical version of the whole being grid in some of the parts well we use that great euphemism trial and error which is exposed to be meaningless but you ask the indians and they say that plants talk to us well what does that mean this tribe the kofan has seventeen varieties of aaska all of which they distinguish a great distance in the forest all of which are referable to our eye as one species and then you ask them how they establish your taxonomy and they say didn't i thought you know something about plants i mean don't you know anything i have to know well it turns out you take each of the seventeen varieties on the night of a full moon and it sings to you in a different key now that's not going to get your ph d at harvard but it's a lot more interesting in counting statements now the problem the problem is that even those of us sympathetic with applied indigenous people view them as quaint and colorful but somehow reduce to the margins of history as a real world meaning our world moves on well the truth is the twentieth century three hundred years from now it's not going to be remembered for its wars or its technological innovations but rather the air in which we stood by and either actively endorsed or passively accepted the massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity on the planet now the problem isn't change all cultures through all time have constant being engaged in a dance with new possibilities of life and the problem is not technology itself the swinians did not stop being suen they gave up the bone arrow any more than american stop being american we gave up the horse and buggy it's not change or technology that threatens the integrity of the ethnosphere it is power the crude face of domination and whenever you look around the world you discover that these are not cultures destined to fade away these are dynamic living peoples being driven on its existence by identifiable forces that are beyond their capacity to adapt to whether it's the egregious deforestation in the homeland of the panan a nomadic people from southeast asia from sarawa a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago and now have all been reduced to servitude in prostitution on the banks of the rivers where you can see the river itself is soiled with the silt that seems to be carrying half of borne away to the sea china sea where the japanese freighters hang light in the horizon ready to fill their holds with raw logs rip from the forest or in the case of the animami it's a disease entities that have come in in the wake of the discovery of gold or if we go into the mountain of tibet where i'm doing a lot of research recently you'll see it's a crude face of political domination no genocide the physical extinction of a people is universally condowned but ethnicide the destruction of a people's way of life is not only not condemned it's universally in many quarters celebrated as part of a development strategy and you cannot understand the pain of tibet until you move through it at the ground level i once traveled six thousand miles from chindu and western china over land through southeastern tibet to lhasa with a young colleague and it was only when i got to lhasa that i understood the face behind the statistics you hear about six thousand sacred monuments torn apart to dust and ashes one point two million people killed by the cadrator in the cultural revolution this young man's father had been described for the pain lama that meant he was instantly killed at the time of the chinese invasion his uncle fled with his holiness in the diaspora that took the people to nepal his mother was incarcerated for the price for the crime of being wealthy he was smuggled into the jail at the age of two to hide beneath her skirt tail becausehe couldn't barely be without him the sister had done that brave deed was put into an education camp one day she'd invertently stepped on an armband of mo and for that transgression she was given seven years of hard labor the pain of tibet can be impossible to bear but the redentive spirit of the people is something to behold and in the end then it really comes down to a choice do we want to live in a monochromatic world of monotany where do we want to embrace a polychromatic world of diversity margaret me the great anthropologist said beforece you died the greatest sphere that was that as we drifted toward this blandly morphist generic worldview not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination reduced to a more narrow and more narrow modality of thought but that we would wake for a dream one day having forgotten that there were even other possibilities and it's humbly to remember that our species has perhaps been around for six hundred thousand years the neolithic revolution which gave us agriculture at which time we succumbed to the cult of the seed the poetry of the shaman was displaced by the prose of the priesthood we created hierarchy specialization surplus is only ten thousand years ago the modern industrial world as we know it is barely three hundred years old now that shallow history doesn't suggest to me that we have all the answers for all of the challenges that will confront us in the ensuing millennia when these myriad cultures of the world are asked the meaning of being human they respond with ten thousand different voices and it's within that song that we will all rediscover the possibility of being what we are a fully conscious species fully aware of ensuring that all peoples in all gardens find a way to flourish and there are great moments of optimism this is a photograph i took at the northern tip of bafin island when i went narvel hunting with some inuit people and this man or told me a marvelous story of his grandfather the canadian government has not always been kind of the inuit people and during the nineteen fifties to establish her sovereignty we forced them into settlements this old man grandfather refused to go the family fearful for his life took away all of his weapons all of his tools now you must understand that the inuit did not fear the cold they took advantage of it the runners of their sledge were originally made of fish wrapped in carebohide so this man's grandfather was not intimidated by the arctic night the blizzart was blowing he simply slipped outside

[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3685162)[0m you know one of the intense pleasures of travel and one of the delights of ethnographic research is the opportunity to live amongst those who have not forgotten the old ways who still feel their past and the wind touch it in stones polished by rain tasted in the bitter leaves of plants just to know that jaguar shamans still journey beyond the milky

that our lineage made i'll be it successfully many generations ag and of course we all share the same adaptive imperatives we're all born we all bring our children to the world we go through initiation rights we have to deal with the inexible separation of death so it should't surprise us that we all see we all dance we all have art but what's interesting is the unique cadence of the song the rhythm of the dance in every culture and whether it is the panan in the forests of borneo or the vodo atollites in haiti or the warriors in the kissed desert of northern kenya the quandta in the mountains of the andes or a cut of a city in the middle of the sahara this is incidentally the fellow that i traveled into the desert with a month ago or indeed a yakurt in the slopes of chamilunga everest the godmother of the world all of these peoples teach us there are other ways of being other ways of thinking other ways of oringing yourself in the earth and this is an idea that you think about it can only fill you with hope now together the myriad cultures of the world make up a web of spiritual life and cultural life that envelopes the planet as as important to the well being of the planet as indeed as a biological web of life that you know as a biosphere and you might think of this cultural web of life as being an ethnosphere and you might define the ethnosphere as being the some total of all thoughts and dreams ness ideas inspirations intuitions brought to being by the human imagination since the dawn of consciousness the ethnosphere is humanity's great legacy it's a symbol of all that we are and all that we can be as an astonishingly inquisitive species and just as the biosphere is being severely eroded so to as the ethnosphere and if anything at a far greater rate no biologists for example would there suggest that fifty percent of all species are more bender on the brink of extinction because it simply is not true and yet that the most apocalyptic scenario in the realm of biological diversity scarcely approaches what we know to be the most optimistic scenario in the realm of cultural diversity and the great indicator of that of course is language loss when each of you in this room were born there are six thousand languages spoken on the planet now a language is not just a body of vocabulary or set of dramatical rules a language is a flash of the human spirit it's a vehicle through which the soul of each particular culture it comes into the material world every language is an old growth forest of the mind a watershed of thought an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities and of those six thousand languages as we see here today in monterey fully half are no longer being whispered into the ears of children they're no longer being taught to babies which means effectively unless something changes they're already dead what could be more lonely than to be enveloped in silence to be the last of your people to speak your language to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors or anticipate the promise of the children and yet that dreadful fate is indeed the play is somebody somewhere on earth roughly every two weeks because every two weeks some elder dies and carries with them into the grade of the last sybles of an ancient ton and i know there some of you say well wouldn't it be better would the world be a better place if we all justpoke one language and i say great let's make that language your but let's make it cantines let's make it kogi and you'll suddenly discover what it would be like to be unable to speak your own

mountains of the andes or a cut of a city in the middle of the sahara this is incidentally the fellow that i traveled into the desert with a month ago or indeed a yakurt in the slopes of chamilunga everest the godmother of the world all of these peoples teach us there are other ways of being other ways of thinking other ways of oringing yourself in the earth and this is an idea that you think about it can only fill you with hope now together the myriad cultures of the world make up a web of spiritual life and cultural life that envelopes the planet as as important to the well being of the planet as indeed as a biological web of life that you know as a biosphere and you might think of this cultural web of life as being an ethnosphere and you might define the ethnosphere as being the some total of all thoughts and dreams ness ideas inspirations intuitions brought to being by the human imagination since the dawn of consciousness the ethnosphere is humanity's great legacy it's a symbol of all that we are and all that we can be as an astonishingly inquisitive species and just as the biosphere is being severely eroded so to as the ethnosphere and if anything at a far greater rate no biologists for example would there suggest that fifty percent of all species are more bender on the brink of extinction because it simply is not true and yet that the most apocalyptic scenario in the realm of biological diversity scarcely approaches what we know to be the most optimistic scenario in the realm of cultural diversity and the great indicator of that of course is language loss when each of you in this room were born there are six thousand languages spoken on the planet now a language is not just a body of vocabulary or set of dramatical rules a language is a flash of the human spirit it's a vehicle through which the soul of each particular culture it comes into the material world every language is an old growth forest of the mind a watershed of thought an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities and of those six thousand languages as we see here today in monterey fully half are no longer being whispered into the ears of children they're no longer being taught to babies which means effectively unless something changes they're already dead what could be more lonely than to be enveloped in silence to be the last of your people to speak your language to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors or anticipate the promise of the children and yet that dreadful fate is indeed the play is somebody somewhere on earth roughly every two weeks because every two weeks some elder dies and carries with them into the grade of the last sybles of an ancient ton and i know there some of you say well wouldn't it be better would the world be a better place if we all justpoke one language and i say great let's make that language your but let's make it cantines let's make it kogi and you'll suddenly discover what it would be like to be unable to speak your own language and so what i'd like to do with you today is to sort of take you on a journey through the ethnosphere a brief journey through the ethnosphere to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost now there are many of us who sort of forget that when i say different ways of being i really do mean different ways of being take for example this child of the barasana northwest amazon people of the anaconda who believe that mythologically they came up the milk rivers in the east and the belly of sacred snakes now this is a people who cognitively do not distinguish the color blue from the color green because the canopy of the heavens is equated to the canopy of the forest upon which the people depend they have a curious language and marriage rule which is called linguistic exogamy you must marry someone who speaks a different language and this is all rooted in mythological past you have the curious things in these long houses where there are six or seven languages spoken because of intermarriage you never hear anyone practicing a language they simply listen and then begin to speak or one of the most fascinating tribes ever lived with the watani of north eastern ecuador and astonishing people first contacted peacefully in nineteen fifty eight and nineteen fifty seven five missionaries attempted contact made a critical mistake they dropped from the air eight by ten glossy photographs of themselves and what we would say to be friendly gestures for getting these people of the rainforest had never seen anything two dimensional in their lives they picked up these photographs on the forest floor tried to look behind the face to fly the form of the figure found nothing and concluded these were calling cards in the devil so they speared the five missionaries to death but the watan didn't just spear outsiders they speared each other fifty four percent of the mortality was to do them spearing each other we traced genealogies backage generations and we found two instances of natural death and when we pressured the people a little bit about it they admitted that one of the fellows had gotten so old that he died getting old so we speared him anyway but at the same time at a postercatious knowledge of the force that was astonishing their hunters could smell animals yearn at forty paces and tell you what species left behind in the early eighties i had a really astonishing assignment when i was asked by my professor at harvard if i was interested in going down to haiti infiltrating the secret societies which were the foundation of devaluous strength and the tota mac and security and the poison used to make zambies in order to make sense of sensation of course i had to understand something about this remarkable faith of medune and buda is not a black magic cult on the contrary it's a complex metaphysical worldview it's interesting if i asked you the name of the great religions of the world what would you say christianity islam buddhism judhism whatever there's always one continent left out is the assumption being that sub saharan africa had no religious belief well of course they did and vod is simply the distallation of these very the found religious ideas that came over during the tragic diosor of the slavery era but what makes vote so interesting is that it's this living relationship between living and the deads the living the birth the spirits the spirits can be invoked from beneath the great water responding to the rhythm of the dance to momentarily displays the soul of the living for that brief shining moment the a light becomes the god that's why the vodouists like to say that the white people go to church and speak about god we dance in the temple and become god and because you are possessed you are taken by a spirit how can you be harmed you see these astonishing demonstrations food acollites in a state of trance handling burning embers with impunity a rather astonishing example of the ability of the mind to affect the body that bears it when catalyzing the state of extreme excitation now of all the peoples that i've ever been with the most extraordinary or the kogi of the sihanovare de senta marka northern columbia the sentants of the ancient tairona civilization which ones corporated the caribbean coastal plane of columbia in the wake of the conquest these people retreated into an isolated volcanic massif that ss above the caribbean coastal plane in a bloodstained continent these people alone were never conquered by a spanish to this day they remain ruled by a ritual priesthood but they're training for the priesthood is rather extraordinary the young aclights are taken away from their families at the age of three and four sequestered in a shadowy world of darkness and stone huts the base of glaciers for eighteen years to nine year periods deliberately chose to mimic the nine months of gestation they spend in their natural mother's mom now they're metaphorically in the home of the great mother and for this entire time they are inculturating into the values of their society values that maintain the proposition of their prayers and their prayers alone maintain the cosmic where we might say the ecological balance and at the end of this amazing initiation one day they're suddenly taken out and for the first time in their lives the age of eighteen they see a sunrise and in that crystal moment of awareness the first light as the sun begins to be the slopes of this stunningly beautiful landscape suddenly everything they have learned in the abstract is a firm and stunning glory and the pre steps back and so you see it's really as i told you it is that beautiful it is yours to protect they call themselves the elder brothers and they say we who are the younger brothers are the ones responsible for destroying the world now this level of intuition becomes very important whenever we think of indigenous people in landscape we either invoke who's so in the old car of rino the noble savage which is an idea racist into simplicity or alternatively we invoke fero and so these people are closer to the earth and we are well indigenous people are neither sentimental nor week and by astalgia there's not a lot of room for either in the malarial swamp of the asthmat where the chilling winds of tibet but they have nevertheless through time and ritual forage the traditional mistake of the earth that is based not an idea of being self consciously close to it but on a far subtler intuition the idea that the earth itself can only exist because it has breathed into being by human consciousness now what does that mean it means that a young kid from the andes who's raised to believe that that mountain is an apple spirit that will direct his or her destiny will be a profoundly different human being and have a different relationship to that resource or that place that a young kid from montana raised to believe that a mountains a pile of raw ready to be mind whether it's a boot of a spirit or a pile of or is irrelevant what's interesting is a metaphor that definds a relationship between the individual and the natural world i was raised in the force the british columbia to believe those force existed to be cut that made me a different human being and my friends amongst the quails who believe that those forces were the abode of hokok and the crooked beak of heaven and the cannable spirits that dwelled to the north end of the world spirits they would have to engage during their homita initiation now if you begin to look at the idea that these cultures could create different realities you can begin to understand some of their extraordinary discoveries take this plant here a photograph i took in the northwest amazon just last april this is alaska which many of you have heard about the most powerful psychoactive the preparation of the shaman's repertoire what makes aoca fascinating is not the sure pharmacological potential of this preparation but the elaboration of it it's made really of two different sources on the one hand this woody leona which has into a series of beta carbolans harming harmly and mildly hallucingenic to take the vine alone is rather to have sort of blue hazey smoke drift across your consciousness but it's mixed with leaves of a shrub in the coffee family called psychoatria veardis this plant has in it some very powerful trip to mean it's very close to brain serotonin diamethal trip to mean five methoxy diamethal trip to mean if you've ever seen the yamami blowing that snuff up their noses that that substance they make from a different set of species it also contains five methoxy diameter trip i mean to have that powder blowing up your nose is rather like being shot out of a riful barrow line with broke paintings and landing on the sea of electricity it doesn't it doesn't cranky it doesn't the distortion of reality it creates the disillusion of reality in fact i used to argue with my professor richard am schultes who is a man who sparked this psychedelic era with his discovery of the magic mushrooms in mexico in the nineteen thirties i used to argue that you couldn't classify these trip to means as lucinogenic because by the time you're under the effects there's no in home anymore to experience lucination but the thing about trick means is they cannot be taken orally because they're denatured by an enzyme found naturally in the human gut called monor monoxidays they can only be taken orally taken in conjunction with some other chemical that denatures emo now the faciting thing is that the beta carbolans found within that leona are mao inhibitors of the precise sort necessary to potentiate the trip to means so you ask yourself a question how in a flora of eighty thousand species of vascular plants that these people find these two morphologically unrelated plants that when combined in this way created a kind of biochemical version of the whole being grid in some of the parts well we use that great euphemism trial and error which is exposed to be meaningless but you ask the indians and they say that plants talk to us well what does that mean this tribe the kofan has seventeen varieties of aaska all of which they distinguish a great distance in the forest all of which are referable to our eye as one species and then you ask them how they establish your taxonomy and they say didn't i thought you know something about plants i mean don't you know anything i have to know well it turns out you take each of the seventeen varieties on the night of a full moon and it sings to you in a different key now that's not going to get your ph d at harvard but it's a lot more interesting in counting statements now the problem the problem is that even those of us sympathetic with applied indigenous people view them as quaint and colorful but somehow reduce to the margins of history as a real world meaning our world moves on well the truth is the twentieth century three hundred years from now it's not going to be remembered for its wars or its technological innovations but rather the air in which we stood by and either actively endorsed or passively accepted the massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity on the planet now the problem isn't change all cultures through all time have constant being engaged in a dance with new possibilities of life and the problem is not technology itself the swinians did not stop being suen they gave up the bone arrow any more than american stop being american we gave up the horse and buggy it's not change or technology that threatens the integrity of the ethnosphere it is power the crude face of domination and whenever you look around the world you discover that these are not cultures destined to fade away these are dynamic living peoples being driven on its existence by identifiable forces that are beyond their capacity to adapt to whether it's the egregious deforestation in the homeland of the panan a nomadic people from southeast asia from sarawa a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago and now have all been reduced to servitude in prostitution on the banks of the rivers where you can see the river itself is soiled with the silt that seems to be carrying half of borne away to the sea china sea where the japanese freighters hang light in the horizon ready to fill their holds with raw logs rip from the forest or in the case of the animami it's a disease entities that have come in in the wake of the discovery of gold or if we go into the mountain of tibet where i'm doing a lot of research recently you'll see it's a crude face of political domination no genocide the physical extinction of a people is universally condowned but ethnicide the destruction of a people's way of life is not only not condemned it's universally in many quarters celebrated as part of a development strategy and you cannot understand the pain of tibet until you move through it at the ground level i once traveled six thousand miles from chindu and western china over land through southeastern tibet to lhasa with a young colleague and it was only when i got to lhasa that i understood the face behind the statistics you hear about six thousand sacred monuments torn apart to dust and ashes one point two million people killed by the cadrator in the cultural revolution this young man's father had been described for the pain lama that meant he was instantly killed at the time of the chinese invasion his uncle fled with his holiness in the diaspora that took the people to nepal his mother was incarcerated for the price for the crime of being wealthy he was smuggled into the jail at the age of two to hide beneath her skirt tail becausehe couldn't barely be without him the sister had done that brave deed was put into an education camp one day she'd invertently stepped on an armband of mo and for that transgression she was given seven years of hard labor the pain of tibet can be impossible to bear but the redentive spirit of the people is something to behold and in the end then it really comes down to a choice do we want to live in a monochromatic world of monotany where do we want to embrace a polychromatic world of diversity margaret me the great anthropologist said beforece you died the greatest sphere that was that as we drifted toward this blandly morphist generic worldview not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination reduced to a more narrow and more narrow modality of thought but that we would wake for a dream one day having forgotten that there were even other possibilities and it's humbly to remember that our species has perhaps been around for six hundred thousand years the neolithic revolution which gave us agriculture at which time we succumbed to the cult of the seed the poetry of the shaman was displaced by the prose of the priesthood we created hierarchy specialization surplus is only ten thousand years ago the modern industrial world as we know it is barely three hundred years old now that shallow history doesn't suggest to me that we have all the answers for all of the challenges that will confront us in the ensuing millennia when these myriad cultures of the world are asked the meaning of being human they respond with ten thousand different voices and it's within that song that we will all rediscover the possibility of being what we are a fully conscious species fully aware of ensuring that all peoples in all gardens find a way to flourish and there are great moments of optimism this is a photograph i took at the northern tip of bafin island when i went narvel hunting with some inuit people and this man or told me a marvelous story of his grandfather the canadian government has not always been kind of the inuit people and during the nineteen fifties to establish her sovereignty we forced them into settlements this old man grandfather refused to go the family fearful for his life took away all of his weapons all of his tools now you must understand that the inuit did not fear the cold they took advantage of it the runners of their sledge were originally made of fish wrapped in carebohide so this man's grandfather was not intimidated by the arctic night the blizzart was blowing he simply slipped outside full down his sealskin trousers and defecated into his hand and as a thesis began to freeze he shaped it in the form of a blade he put a spray of saliva on the edge of the shit knife and as it finally throws solid he puts a dog with it he skinned the dog and improvised a harness took the ribcage of the dog and improvised a sled harness up in the jacon dog and disappeared over the ice flows shit knife and belt talk about getting by with nothing and this in many ways is a symbol of the resilience of the inuit people and of all indigenous people around the world the canadian government apple of ninety ninety nine gave back to total control of the inuit an area of land large and california and texas put together it's our new homeland it's called nunavits an independent territory they control all mineral resources an amazing example of how a nation state can reach seek restitution with its people and finally in the end i think it's pretty obvious at least to all of us who have traveled in these remote reaches of the planet to realize that they are not remote at all their homelands of somebody they represent branches of the human imagination they go back to the dawn of time and for all of us the dreams of these children like the dreams of our own children become part of the naked geography of hope so what we're trying to do at the national geographic finally is we believe that politicians will never accomplish anything we think that polymics we think that polymics
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3685162)[0m you know one of the intense pleasures of travel and one of the delights of ethnographic research is the opportunity to live amongst those who have not forgotten the old ways who still feel their past and the wind touch it in stones polished by rain tasted in the bitter leaves of plants just to know that jaguar shamans still journey beyond the milky way or the the myths of the inuit elders still resonate with meaning or that in the himalaya the buddhist still pursue the breath of the darma is to really remember the central revelation of anthropology and that is the idea that the world in which we live in does not exist in some absolute sense but it's just one model of reality the consequence of one particular set of adapt of choices that our lineage made i'll be it successfully many generations ag and of course we all share the same adaptive imperatives we're all born we all bring our children to the world we go through initiation rights we have to deal with the inexible separation of death so it should't surprise us that we all see we all dance we all have art but what's interesting is the unique cadence of the song the rhythm of the dance in every culture and whether it is the panan in the forests of borneo or the vodo atollites in haiti or the warriors in the kissed desert of northern kenya the quandta in the

down to a choice do we want to live in a monochromatic world of monotany where do we want to embrace a polychromatic world of diversity margaret me the great anthropologist said beforece you died the greatest sphere that was that as we drifted toward this blandly morphist generic worldview not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination reduced to a more narrow and more narrow modality of thought but that we would wake for a dream one day having forgotten that there were even other possibilities and it's humbly to remember that our species has perhaps been around for six hundred thousand years the neolithic revolution which gave us agriculture at which time we succumbed to the cult of the seed the poetry of the shaman was displaced by the prose of the priesthood we created hierarchy specialization surplus is only ten thousand years ago the modern industrial world as we know it is barely three hundred years old now that shallow history doesn't suggest to me that we have all the answers for all of the challenges that will confront us in the ensuing millennia when these myriad cultures of the world are asked the meaning of being human they respond with ten thousand different voices and it's within that song that we will all rediscover the possibility of being what we are a fully conscious species fully aware of ensuring that all peoples in all gardens find a way to flourish and there are great moments of optimism this is a photograph i took at the northern tip of bafin island when i went narvel hunting with some inuit people and this man or told me a marvelous story of his grandfather the canadian government has not always been kind of the inuit people and during the nineteen fifties to establish her sovereignty we forced them into settlements this old man grandfather refused to go the family fearful for his life took away all of his weapons all of his tools now you must understand that the inuit did not fear the cold they took advantage of it the runners of their sledge were originally made of fish wrapped in carebohide so this man's grandfather was not intimidated by the arctic night the blizzart was blowing he simply slipped outside full down his sealskin trousers and defecated into his hand and as a thesis began to freeze he shaped it in the form of a blade he put a spray of saliva on the edge of the shit knife and as it finally throws solid he puts a dog with it he skinned the dog and improvised a harness took the ribcage of the dog and improvised a sled harness up in the jacon dog and disappeared over the ice flows shit knife and belt talk about getting by with nothing and this in many ways is a symbol of the resilience of the inuit people and of all indigenous people around the world the canadian government apple of ninety ninety nine gave back to total control of the inuit an area of land large and california and texas put together it's our new homeland it's called nunavits an independent territory they control all mineral resources an amazing example of how a nation state can reach seek restitution with its people and finally in the end i think it's pretty obvious at least to all of us who have traveled in these remote reaches of the planet to realize that they are not remote at all their homelands of somebody they represent branches of the human imagination they go back to the dawn of time and for all of us the dreams of these children like the dreams of our own children become part of the naked geography of hope so what we're trying to do at the national geographic finally is we believe that politicians will never accomplish anything we think that polymics we think that polymics are not persuasive but we think that storytelling can change the world and so we are probably the best storytelling institution in the world we get thirty five million
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3685162)[0m you know one of the intense pleasures of travel and one of the delights of ethnographic research is the opportunity to live amongst those who have not forgotten the old ways who still feel their past and the wind touch it in stones polished by rain tasted in the bitter leaves of plants just to know that jaguar shamans still journey beyond the milky way or the the myths of the inuit elders still resonate with meaning or that in the himalaya the buddhist still pursue the breath of the darma is to really remember the central revelation of anthropology and that is the idea that the world in which we live in does not exist in some absolute sense but it's just one model of reality the consequence of one particular set of adapt of choices that our lineage made i'll be it successfully many generations ag and of course we all share the same adaptive imperatives we're all born we all bring our children to the world we go through initiation rights we have to deal with the inexible separation of death so it should't surprise us that we all see we all dance we all have art but what's interesting is the unique cadence of the song the rhythm of the dance in every culture and whether it is the panan in the forests of borneo or the vodo atollites in haiti or the warriors in the kissed desert of northern kenya the quandta in the mountains of the andes or a cut of a city in the middle of the sahara this is incidentally the fellow that i traveled into the desert with a month ago or indeed a yakurt in the slopes of chamilunga everest the godmother of the world all of these peoples teach us there are other ways of being other ways of thinking other ways of oringing yourself in the earth and this is an idea that you think about it can only fill you with hope now together the myriad cultures of the world make up a web of spiritual life and cultural life that envelopes the planet as as important to the well being of the planet as indeed as a biological web of life that you know as a biosphere and you might think of this cultural web of life as being an ethnosphere and you might define the ethnosphere as being the some total of all thoughts and dreams ness ideas inspirations intuitions brought to being by the human imagination since the dawn of consciousness the ethnosphere is humanity's great legacy it's a symbol of all that we are and all that we can be as an astonishingly inquisitive species and just as the biosphere is being severely eroded so to as the ethnosphere and if anything at a far greater rate no biologists for example would there suggest that fifty percent of all species are more bender on the brink of extinction because it simply is not true and yet that the most apocalyptic scenario in the realm of biological diversity scarcely approaches what we know to be the most optimistic scenario in the realm of cultural diversity and the great indicator of that of course is language loss when each of you in this room were born there are six thousand languages spoken on the planet now a language is not just a body of vocabulary or set of dramatical rules a language is a flash of the human spirit it's a vehicle through which the soul of each particular culture it comes into the material world every language is an old growth forest of the mind a watershed of thought an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities and of those six thousand languages as we see here today in monterey fully half are no longer being whispered into the ears of children they're no longer being taught to babies which means effectively unless something changes they're already dead what could be more lonely than to be enveloped in silence to be the last of your people to speak your language to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors or anticipate the promise of the children and yet that dreadful fate is indeed the play is somebody somewhere on earth roughly every two weeks because every two weeks some elder dies and carries with them into the grade of the last sybles of an ancient ton and i know there some of you say well wouldn't it be better would the world be a better place if we all justpoke one language and i say great let's make that language your but let's make it cantines let's make it kogi and you'll suddenly discover what it would be like to be unable to speak your own language and so what i'd like to do with you today is to sort of take you on a journey through the ethnosphere a brief journey through the ethnosphere to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost now there are many of us who sort of forget that when i say different ways of being i really do mean different ways of being take for example this child of the barasana northwest amazon people of the anaconda who believe that mythologically they came up the milk rivers in the east and the belly of sacred snakes now this is a people who cognitively do not distinguish the color blue from the color green because the canopy of the heavens is equated to the canopy of the forest upon which the people depend they have a curious language and marriage rule which is called linguistic exogamy you must marry someone who speaks a different language and this is all rooted in mythological past you have the curious things in these long houses where there are six or seven languages spoken because of intermarriage you never hear anyone practicing a language they simply listen and then begin to speak or one of the most fascinating tribes ever lived with the watani of north eastern ecuador and astonishing people first contacted peacefully in nineteen fifty eight and nineteen fifty seven five missionaries attempted contact made a critical mistake they dropped from the air eight by ten glossy photographs of themselves and what we would say to be friendly gestures for getting these people of the rainforest had never seen anything two dimensional in their lives they picked up these photographs on the forest floor tried to look behind the face to fly the form of the figure found nothing and concluded these were calling cards in the devil so they speared the five missionaries to death but the watan didn't just spear outsiders they speared each other fifty four percent of the mortality was to do them spearing each other we traced genealogies backage generations and we found two instances of natural death and when we pressured the people a little bit about it they admitted that one of the fellows had gotten so old that he died getting old so we speared him anyway but at the same time at a postercatious knowledge of the force that was astonishing their hunters could smell animals yearn at forty paces and tell you what species left behind in the early eighties i had a really astonishing assignment when i was asked by my professor at harvard if i was interested in going down to haiti infiltrating the secret societies which were the foundation of devaluous strength and the tota mac and security and the poison used to make zambies in order to make sense of sensation of course i had to understand something about this remarkable faith of medune and buda is not a black magic cult on the contrary it's a complex metaphysical worldview it's interesting if i asked you the name of the great religions of the world what would you say christianity islam buddhism judhism whatever there's always one continent left out is the assumption being that sub saharan africa had no religious belief well of course they did and vod is simply the distallation of these very the found religious ideas that came over during the tragic diosor of the slavery era but what makes vote so interesting is that it's this living relationship between living and the deads the living the birth the spirits the spirits can be invoked from beneath the great water responding to the rhythm of the dance to momentarily displays the soul of the living for that brief shining moment the a light becomes the god that's why the vodouists like to say that the white people go to church and speak about god we dance in the temple and become god and because you are possessed you are taken by a spirit how can you be harmed you see these astonishing demonstrations food acollites in a state of trance handling burning embers with impunity a rather astonishing example of the ability of the mind to affect the body that bears it when catalyzing the state of extreme excitation now of all the peoples that i've ever been with the most extraordinary or the kogi of the sihanovare de senta marka northern columbia the sentants of the ancient tairona civilization which ones corporated the caribbean coastal plane of columbia in the wake of the conquest these people retreated into an isolated volcanic massif that ss above the caribbean coastal plane in a bloodstained continent these people alone were never conquered by a spanish to this day they remain ruled by a ritual priesthood but they're training for the priesthood is rather extraordinary the young aclights are taken away from their families at the age of three and four sequestered in a shadowy world of darkness and stone huts the base of glaciers for eighteen years to nine year periods deliberately chose to mimic the nine months of gestation they spend in their natural mother's mom now they're metaphorically in the home of the great mother and for this entire time they are inculturating into the values of their society values that maintain the proposition of their prayers and their prayers alone maintain the cosmic where we might say the ecological balance and at the end of this amazing initiation one day they're suddenly taken out and for the first time in their lives the age of eighteen they see a sunrise and in that crystal moment of awareness the first light as the sun begins to be the slopes of this stunningly beautiful landscape suddenly everything they have learned in the abstract is a firm and stunning glory and the pre steps back and so you see it's really as i told you it is that beautiful it is yours to protect they call themselves the elder brothers and they say we who are the younger brothers are the ones responsible for destroying the world now this level of intuition becomes very important whenever we think of indigenous people in landscape we either invoke who's so in the old car of rino the noble savage which is an idea racist into simplicity or alternatively we invoke fero and so these people are closer to the earth and we are well indigenous people are neither sentimental nor week and by astalgia there's not a lot of room for either in the malarial swamp of the asthmat where the chilling winds of tibet but they have nevertheless through time and ritual forage the traditional mistake of the earth that is based not an idea of being self consciously close to it but on a far subtler intuition the idea that the earth itself can only exist because it has breathed into being by human consciousness now what does that mean it means that a young kid from the andes who's raised to believe that that mountain is an apple spirit that will direct his or her destiny will be a profoundly different human being and have a different relationship to that resource or that place that a young kid from montana raised to believe that a mountains a pile of raw ready to be mind whether it's a boot of a spirit or a pile of or is irrelevant what's interesting is a metaphor that definds a relationship between the individual and the natural world i was raised in the force the british columbia to believe those force existed to be cut that made me a different human being and my friends amongst the quails who believe that those forces were the abode of hokok and the crooked beak of heaven and the cannable spirits that dwelled to the north end of the world spirits they would have to engage during their homita initiation now if you begin to look at the idea that these cultures could create different realities you can begin to understand some of their extraordinary discoveries take this plant here a photograph i took in the northwest amazon just last april this is alaska which many of you have heard about the most powerful psychoactive the preparation of the shaman's repertoire what makes aoca fascinating is not the sure pharmacological potential of this preparation but the elaboration of it it's made really of two different sources on the one hand this woody leona which has into a series of beta carbolans harming harmly and mildly hallucingenic to take the vine alone is rather to have sort of blue hazey smoke drift across your consciousness but it's mixed with leaves of a shrub in the coffee family called psychoatria veardis this plant has in it some very powerful trip to mean it's very close to brain serotonin diamethal trip to mean five methoxy diamethal trip to mean if you've ever seen the yamami blowing that snuff up their noses that that substance they make from a different set of species it also contains five methoxy diameter trip i mean to have that powder blowing up your nose is rather like being shot out of a riful barrow line with broke paintings and landing on the sea of electricity it doesn't it doesn't cranky it doesn't the distortion of reality it creates the disillusion of reality in fact i used to argue with my professor richard am schultes who is a man who sparked this psychedelic era with his discovery of the magic mushrooms in mexico in the nineteen thirties i used to argue that you couldn't classify these trip to means as lucinogenic because by the time you're under the effects there's no in home anymore to experience lucination but the thing about trick means is they cannot be taken orally because they're denatured by an enzyme found naturally in the human gut called monor monoxidays they can only be taken orally taken in conjunction with some other chemical that denatures emo now the faciting thing is that the beta carbolans found within that leona are mao inhibitors of the precise sort necessary to potentiate the trip to means so you ask yourself a question how in a flora of eighty thousand species of vascular plants that these people find these two morphologically unrelated plants that when combined in this way created a kind of biochemical version of the whole being grid in some of the parts well we use that great euphemism trial and error which is exposed to be meaningless but you ask the indians and they say that plants talk to us well what does that mean this tribe the kofan has seventeen varieties of aaska all of which they distinguish a great distance in the forest all of which are referable to our eye as one species and then you ask them how they establish your taxonomy and they say didn't i thought you know something about plants i mean don't you know anything i have to know well it turns out you take each of the seventeen varieties on the night of a full moon and it sings to you in a different key now that's not going to get your ph d at harvard but it's a lot more interesting in counting statements now the problem the problem is that even those of us sympathetic with applied indigenous people view them as quaint and colorful but somehow reduce to the margins of history as a real world meaning our world moves on well the truth is the twentieth century three hundred years from now it's not going to be remembered for its wars or its technological innovations but rather the air in which we stood by and either actively endorsed or passively accepted the massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity on the planet now the problem isn't change all cultures through all time have constant being engaged in a dance with new possibilities of life and the problem is not technology itself the swinians did not stop being suen they gave up the bone arrow any more than american stop being american we gave up the horse and buggy it's not change or technology that threatens the integrity of the ethnosphere it is power the crude face of domination and whenever you look around the world you discover that these are not cultures destined to fade away these are dynamic living peoples being driven on its existence by identifiable forces that are beyond their capacity to adapt to whether it's the egregious deforestation in the homeland of the panan a nomadic people from southeast asia from sarawa a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago and now have all been reduced to servitude in prostitution on the banks of the rivers where you can see the river itself is soiled with the silt that seems to be carrying half of borne away to the sea china sea where the japanese freighters hang light in the horizon ready to fill their holds with raw logs rip from the forest or in the case of the animami it's a disease entities that have come in in the wake of the discovery of gold or if we go into the mountain of tibet where i'm doing a lot of research recently you'll see it's a crude face of political domination no genocide the physical extinction of a people is universally condowned but ethnicide the destruction of a people's way of life is not only not condemned it's universally in many quarters celebrated as part of a development strategy and you cannot understand the pain of tibet until you move through it at the ground level i once traveled six thousand miles from chindu and western china over land through southeastern tibet to lhasa with a young colleague and it was only when i got to lhasa that i understood the face behind the statistics you hear about six thousand sacred monuments torn apart to dust and ashes one point two million people killed by the cadrator in the cultural revolution this young man's father had been described for the pain lama that meant he was instantly killed at the time of the chinese invasion his uncle fled with his holiness in the diaspora that took the people to nepal his mother was incarcerated for the price for the crime of being wealthy he was smuggled into the jail at the age of two to hide beneath her skirt tail becausehe couldn't barely be without him the sister had done that brave deed was put into an education camp one day she'd invertently stepped on an armband of mo and for that transgression she was given seven years of hard labor the pain of tibet can be impossible to bear but the redentive spirit of the people is something to behold and in the end then it really comes down to a choice do we want to live in a monochromatic world of monotany where do we want to embrace a polychromatic world of diversity margaret me the great anthropologist said beforece you died the greatest sphere that was that as we drifted toward this blandly morphist generic worldview not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination reduced to a more narrow and more narrow
