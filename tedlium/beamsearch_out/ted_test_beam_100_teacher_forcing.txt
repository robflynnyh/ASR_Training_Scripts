[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3659047)[0m now for some time i have been interested in the placebo effect which might seem like an odd thing for a magician to be interested in unless you think of it in the terms that i do which is something fake is believed in enough by somebody that it becomes something real in other words sugar pills have a measurable effect in certain kinds of studies the placebo effect just because the person thinks what's happening to them is a pharmaceutical or some sort of for pain management for example if they believe it enough there's a measurable effect in the body called the placebo effect something fake becomes something real because of someone's perception of it in order for us to understand each other i want to start by showing you a rudimentary very simple magic trick and i'm going to show you how it works this trick that's been in every children's magic book since at least the nineteen fifties i learned myself from cub scout magic in the nineteen seventies so i'll do it for you and then i'll explain it and then i'll explain why i explained it ok so here's what happens the life which you could examine my hand which you could examine i was going to hold the knife in my fish like this i get my sleeve back and to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve i'm just going to squeeze my wrist right here that way you can see that at no time can anything travel as long as i'm squeezing there nothing can go up or down my sleep and the object of this is quite simple i'm going to open my hand and hopefully if all as well my pure animal magnetism will hold the knife in fact it's held so tightly in place that i can shake it and the knife does not come off nothing goes up or down my sleeve no trickery and you can examine everything ca so this is a trick that i often teach to young children that are interested in magic because you can learn a great deal about deception by studying this even though it's a very simple trick methodlogically probably many of you in the room know this trick what happens is this i hold the night in my hand and i say i'm going to grab all of my risk to make sure nothing goes up and down my sleeve that is a lie the reason i'm holding on to my risk is because that's actually the secret of the illusion in a moment when my hand moves from facing you to being away from you this finger right here my index fingers are just going to shift from where it is to a position pointing out like this nice one someone who didn't have a childhood out there so it goes like this from here right and as i move around my finger shift so we can talk about why this is deceptive why you don't notice there are only three fingers down here because the mine in the way it processes information it doesn't count one two three groups them but that's not really what this is about right and then i open my hand obviously it's clinging there not by animal magnetism but by chic canary next finger being there and then when i closed my finger same thing as i moved back this motion kind of covers the moving back of my finger i take this hand away you give the knife out there is a trick you can do for your friends and neighbors and thanks now what does that have to do with the perceval effect well i read a study a year or so ago that really blew my mind wide open i'm not a doctor or a researcher so this to me was an astonishing thing it turns out that if you administer a placebo in the form of a white pill that's like aspirin shaped just a round white pill it has some certain measurable effect but if you change the form that you give the placebo in like you make a smaller pill and color it blue and stamp a letter into it it is actually measurably more effective even though neither one of these things has any pharmaceutical there sugar pills but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill they're going to be about what
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3659056)[0m i grew up on study diet of sides fiction in high school i took a bus to school an hour each way every day and i was always absorbed in a book science fiction book which took my mind to other worlds and satisfied in a narrative form this insatiable sense of curiosity that i had and you know that curiosity also manifested itself in the fact that whenever i was in school i was out in the woods hiking and taking samples frogs and snakes and bugs and pond water and bringing it back looking at it under the microscope i was you know i was real science peak but it was all about trying to understand understand the world understand the limits of possibility and my love of science fiction actually seemed to be mirred in the world around me because what was happening this was in the late sixties you know we were going to the moon we were exploring the deep oceans jacques cousteau was coming into our living rooms with his amazing specials that showed us animals and places in a wondrous world that we could never really have previously imagined so that seemed to resonate with the whole science fiction part of it and i was an artist i could draw paint and i found that because there weren't video games and this saturation of sg movies and all of this imagery in the media landscape i had to create these images in my head you know we all did as kids having to read a book and through the office description put something on the screen the movie screen in our heads and so my response to this was to paint to draw alien creatures alien worlds robots spaceships all that stuff i was endlessly getting busted in math class you know doodling behind the textbook and that was the creativity had to find its outlet somehow and an interesting thing happened there jack cousteo that shows actually got me very excited about the fact that there was an alien world right here on earth i might not really go to an alien world on a spaceship someday that seemed pretty darn unlikely but that was a world i could really go to right here on earth it was as rich and exotic as anything that i had imagined from reading these books so i decided i was going to become a scuba diver at the age of fifteen and the only problem with that was that i lived in a little village in canada six hundred miles from the nearest ocean but i didn't let that daunt me i pastured my father until he finally found a scuba class in buffalo new york right across the border from where we live then i actually got certified in a pool at a ymca in the dead of winter in buffalo new york and i didn't see the ocean a real ocean for another two years and so we moved to california and now since then in the intervening forty years i've spent about three thousand hours underwater and five hundred hours of that was in submersibles and i've learned that that deep ocean environment and even the shallow oceans are so rich with amazing life that really is beyond beyond our imagination and nature's imagination is so so boundless compared to our own mere human imagination i still to this day stand in absolute awe of what i see when i make these dives and i love afair with the oceans is ongoing and just as strong as it ever was but when i chose career as an adult it was filmmaking and that seemed to be the best way to reconcile this urge i had to tell stories with my urges to create images and i was as a kid constantly drawing comic puts and so on so film making was the way to put pictures and stories together and that made sense and of course the stories that i chose to tell were science fiction stories terminator aliens then the abyss and with the abyss i was putting together my love of underwater and diving with filmmaking so you know merging the two passions something interesting came out of the abyss which was to solve a specific narrative problem on that film which was to create this kind of liquid water creature we actually embraced a computer generated animation sg and this resulted in the first soft surface character seg animation that was ever in him in a movie

[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3659045)[0m i'm game i'm a game designer in making games online now for ten years and my goal for the next decade is to try to make it as easy to save the world in

we spend three billion hours a week playing online games some of you might be thinking that's a lot of time to spend playing games maybe too much time considering how many urgent problems we have to solve in the real world but actually according to my research at the institute for the future it's actually the opposite is true three billion hours a week is not nearly enough game play to solve the world's most urgent problems in fact i believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet we need to increase that total dramatically i've calculated the total we need at twenty one billion hours of game play every week so that's probably a bit of a counterintuitive idea so i'll just say it again let it sync in and if we want to solve problems like hunger poverty climate change global conflict obesity with i believe that we need to aspire to play games online for at least twenty one billion hours a week by the end of the next decade now i'm serious i am here's why this picture pretty much sums up why i think games are so essential to the future survival of the human species truly this is a portrait by a photographer named phil told dono he wanted to capture the

crinkle of the eyes up and around the mouth is the sign of optimism and the highbrls up is surprised this is a gamer who's on the verge of something called an epic wind no well you heard of that okay

imagination and when you get there you're shocked to discover what you're truly capable of that's an epic win this is a gamer on the verge of an ethic win and this is the face that we need to see on millions of problem solvers all over the world as we try to tackle the obstacles of the next century the face of someone who against all odds is on the verge of an epic win now unfortunately this is more of the face that we see in everyday life now as we try to tackle urgent problems this is what i call the i'm not good at life face and this is actually me making it can you see it yes good this is actually me making the i'm not good at life face this is a piece of graffiti in my old neighborhood in berkeley california where i did my phd on why we're better in games than we are in real life and this is a problem that a lot of gamers have we feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games and i don't mean just good as in successful although it's part of it we do achieve more in game worlds but i also mean good as in motivated to do something that matters inspired to collaborate and to cooperate when we're in game worlds i believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves the most likely to help at a moment notice the most likely to stick with a problem as long as it takes to get up after failure and try again and in real life when we face failure when we confront obstacles we often don't feel that way we feel overcome we feel overwhelmed we feel anxious may be depressed frustrated or cynical we never have this feelings from we're playing games they just don't exist in games so that's what i wanted to study when i was a graduate student what about games makes it impossible to feel that we can't achieve everything how can we take those feelings from games and apply them to real world work so i looked at games like world of warcraft which is really the ideal collaborative problem solving environment and i started to notice a few things that make epequins so possible in allline worlds so the first thing is whenever you show up in one of these allline games especially in world of worecraft there are lots and lots of different characters who are willing to trust you with a world saving mission right away but not just any mission it's a mission that is perfectly matched with your current level in the game right so you can do it they

want to go back before there were automobiles or twitter or american idle i don't know i'm convinced that there's some sort of pull and nostalgia to wishful thinking and i understand that i'm not part

there's never been a time like this my great grandparents died all of them by the time they were sixty my grandparents pushed that number to seventy my parents were closing in our navy so they're

they're going away and they're going away soon and unless we innovate our way out of this mess we're going away to so the question is can we do that and i think we can i think it's clear that we can make food that will feed billions of people without raping the land that they live on i think we can power this world with energy that doesn't also destroy it i really do believe that and no it ain't wishful thinking but here's the thing that keeps me up at night one of the things that keeps me up at night we've never needed progress in science more than we need it right now never and we've also never been in a position to deploy it properly in the way that we can today we're on the verge of amazing amazing events in many fields and yet i actually think we'd have to go back hundreds three hundred years before the enlightenment to find a time when we battle progress when we thought about these things more vigorously on more fronts than we do now people wrap themselves in their beliefs and they do it so tightly that you can't set them free not even the truth will set them free and listen everyone's entitled to their opinion they're even entitled to their opinion about progress but you know you're not entitled to you're not entitled to your own facts sorry you're not and this took me a while to figure out about a decade ago i wrote a story about vaccines from the new yorker a

i moved on and soon after that i wrote a story about genetically engineered food same thing only bigger people were going crazy so i wrote a story about that too and i couldn't understand why people

moved on i mean i'm a journalist we type we file we go to dinner it's fun but these stories bothered me and i couldn't figure out why and eventually i did and that's because of those fanatics that

[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3659056)[0m i grew up on study diet of sides fiction in high school i took a bus to school an hour each way every day and i was always absorbed in a book science fiction book which took my mind to other worlds and satisfied in a narrative form this insatiable sense of curiosity that i had and you know that curiosity also manifested itself in the fact that whenever i was in school i was out in the woods hiking and taking samples frogs and snakes and bugs and pond water and bringing it back looking at it under the microscope i was you know i was real science peak but it was all about trying to understand understand the world understand the limits of possibility and my love of science fiction actually seemed to be mirred in the world around me because what was happening this was in the late sixties you know we were going to the moon we were exploring the deep oceans jacques cousteau was coming into our living rooms with his amazing specials that showed us animals and places in a wondrous world that we could never really have previously imagined so that seemed to resonate with the whole science fiction part of it and i was an artist i could draw paint and i found that because there weren't video games and this saturation of sg movies and all of this imagery in the media landscape i had to create these images in my head you know we all did as kids having to read a book and through the office description put something on the screen the movie screen in our heads and so my response to this was to paint to draw alien creatures alien worlds robots spaceships all that stuff i was endlessly getting busted in math class you know doodling behind the textbook and that was the creativity had to find its outlet somehow and an interesting thing happened there jack cousteo that shows actually got me very excited about the fact that there was an alien world right here on earth i might not really go to an alien world on a spaceship someday that seemed pretty darn unlikely but that was a world i could really go to right here on earth it was as rich and exotic as anything that i had imagined from reading these books so i decided i was going to become a scuba diver at the age of fifteen and the only problem with that was that i lived in a little village in canada six hundred miles from the nearest ocean but i didn't let that daunt me i pastured my father until he finally found a scuba class in buffalo new york right across the border from where we live then i actually got certified in a pool at a ymca in the dead of winter in buffalo new york and i didn't see the ocean a real ocean for another two years and so we moved to california and now since then in the intervening forty years i've spent about three thousand hours underwater and five hundred hours of that was in submersibles and i've learned that that deep ocean environment and even the shallow oceans are so rich with amazing life that really is beyond beyond our imagination and nature's imagination is so so boundless compared to our own mere human imagination i still to this day stand in absolute awe of what i see when i make these dives and i love afair with the oceans is ongoing and just as strong as it ever was but when i chose career as an adult it was filmmaking and that seemed to be the best way to reconcile this urge i had to tell stories with my urges to create images and i was as a kid constantly drawing comic puts and so on so film making was the way to put pictures and stories together and that made sense and of course the stories that i chose to tell were science fiction stories terminator aliens then the abyss and with the abyss i was putting together my love of underwater and diving with filmmaking so you know merging the two passions something interesting came out of the abyss which was to solve a specific narrative problem on that film which was to create this kind of liquid water creature we actually embraced a computer generated animation sg and this resulted in the first soft surface character seg animation that was ever in him in a movie and even though child been making money bare and broke even i should say i witness something amazing which is that the audience the global audience was mesmerized by this apparent magic you know arthur clark's law and any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable for magic they were seeing something magical and so that got me very excited i thought wow this is something that needs to be embraced into the systematic art so with terminator two which was my next film we took that much further working with ilm we created the liquid metal dude in that film and the success i in the balance on whether that effect would work and it did and we created magic again and we had the same result with an audience although we didn't make a little more money on that way so

[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3659033)[0m if i can leave you with one big idea today it's that the whole of the data in which we consume is greater than the sum of the parts and instead of thinking about information overload what i'd like you to think about is how we can use information to that pattern's pop and we can see trends that would otherwise be invisible so what we're looking at right here is a typical mortality chart organized by age this the tool that i'm using here is a little experiment it's called pivot and with pivot what i can do is i can choose to filter in one particular cause of death say accidents right away i see there's a different pattern that emerges this is because in the mid area here people are the most active and over here they're most frail we can step back out again and then reorganize the data by cause of death seeing that circulatory diseases and cancers are the usual suspects but not for everyone if we go ahead and we filter but by age forty years or less we see that accidents are actually the greatest cause that people have to be worried about and we've drilled into that it's especially the case for mat so you get the idea that viewing information viewing data in this way is a lot like swimming and living information and gographic and if we can do this for raw data why not do it for content as well so what we have right here is the cover of every single sports illustrate it ever produced it's all here it's all on the web you can go back to your rooms and try this after my talk with pivot you can drill into a decade you can drill into a particular year you can jump right into a specific issue so i'm looking at this i see the athletes that have appeared in this issue the sports i'm a lance armstrong fan so i'll go ahead and click on that which reveals for me all the issues in which lance armstrong has been part of now if i want to just kind of take a peak at these i'm going to think well what about taking a look at all of cycling so i can step back and expand on that and i see greg lamo now and so you get the idea that when you navigate over information this way going narrow broader backing in backing out you're not searching you're not browsing you're doing something that's actually a little bit different it's in between and we think it changes the way information can be used so i want to extrapolate on this idea with something that's a little bit crazy what we've done here is we've taken every single wikipedia page and we reduce it down to a little summary so the summary consists of just a little synopsis and the icon to indicate the topical area that it comes from i'm only showing the top five hundred most popular wikipedia page is right here but even in this limited view we can do a lot of things right away we get a sense of what are the topical domains that are most popular and wikipedia i'm going to go ahead and slight government now having selected government i can now see that the wikipedia categories that was frequently correspond to that our time magazine people of the year so this is really important because this is an insight that was not contained within anyone wikipedia page it's only possible to see that insight when you step back and look at all of them looking at one of these particular summaries i can then drill into the concept of a time magazine person of the year bringing up all of them so looking at these people i can see that the majority come from government some have come from natural sciences some if you still have come from business there's my boss and one has come from music and interestingly enough bono is also a ted prize winner so we can go jump and take a look at all the ted prize winners so you see we're navigating the web for the first time as if it's actually a web not from page to page but at a higher level of abstraction and so i want to show you one other thing that may catch a little bit by surprise i'm just showing the new york times website here so pivot this application i don't want to call it to browsers really not a browser but you can view web pages with it and we bring that zoomable technology to every single web page like this so i can step back pop right back into a specific section now the reason why this is important is because by virtue of just viewing web pages in this way i can look at in my entire browsing history in the exact same way so i can drill into what i've done over specific time frames here in fact is the state of all the demo that i just gave and i can sort of replace some stuff that i was looking at earlier today and if i want to step back and look at everything i can slice and die my history perhaps by my search history here is doing some napatistic searching looking for being over here for live labs bit of it and from these i can drill into the web pages and just launch them again it's one metaph that re purpose multiple times and in each case it makes the whole greater than the sum of the parts with the data so right now in this world we think about data as being this curse we talk about the curse of information overload we talk about drowning in data what if we can actually turn that upside down and turn the web upside down
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3659047)[0m now for some time i have been interested in the placebo effect which might seem like an odd thing for a magician to be interested in unless you think of it in the terms that i do which is something fake is believed in enough by somebody that it becomes something real in other words sugar pills have a measurable effect in certain kinds of studies the placebo effect just because the person thinks what's happening to them is a pharmaceutical or some sort of for pain management for example if they believe it enough there's a measurable effect in the body called the placebo effect something fake becomes something real because of someone's perception of it in order for us to understand each other i want to start by showing you a rudimentary very simple magic trick and i'm going to show you how it works this trick that's been in every children's magic book since at least the nineteen fifties i learned myself from cub scout magic in the nineteen seventies so i'll do it for you and then i'll explain it and then i'll explain why i explained it ok so here's what happens the life which you could examine my hand which you could examine i was going to hold the knife in my fish like this i get my sleeve back and to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve i'm just going to squeeze my wrist right here that way you can see that at no time can anything travel as long as i'm squeezing there nothing can go up or down my sleep and the object of this is quite simple i'm going to open my hand and hopefully if all as well my pure animal magnetism will hold the knife in fact it's held so tightly in place that i can shake it and the knife does not come off nothing goes up or down my sleeve no trickery and you can examine everything ca so this is a trick that i often teach to young children that are interested in magic because you can learn a great deal about deception by studying this even though it's a very simple trick methodlogically probably many of you in the room know this trick what happens is this i hold the night in my hand and i say i'm going to grab all of my risk to make sure nothing goes up and down my sleeve that is a lie the reason i'm holding on to my risk is because that's actually the secret of the illusion in a moment when my hand moves from facing you to being away from you this finger right here my index fingers are just going to shift from where it is to a position pointing out like this nice one someone who didn't have a childhood out there so it goes like this from here right and as i move around my finger shift so we can talk about why this is deceptive why you don't notice there are only three fingers down here because the mine in the way it processes information it doesn't count one two three groups them but that's not really what this is about right and then i open my hand obviously it's clinging there not by animal magnetism but by chic canary next finger being there and then when i closed my finger same thing as i moved back this motion kind of covers the moving back of my finger i take this hand away you give the knife out there is a trick you can do for your friends and neighbors and thanks now what does that have to do with the perceval effect well i read a study a year or so ago that really blew my mind wide open i'm not a doctor or a researcher so this to me was an astonishing thing it turns out that if you administer a placebo in the form of a white pill that's like aspirin shaped just a round white pill it has some certain measurable effect but if you change the form that you give the placebo in like you make a smaller pill and color it blue and stamp a letter into it it is actually measurably more effective even though neither one of these things has any pharmaceutical there sugar pills but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill they're going to be about what that really flit meown turns out though that's not even where it stops if you have capsules they're more effective than tablets in any form a colored capsule that's yellow on one end and red on the other is better than a white capsule dosage has something to do with this you know one pill twice a day is not as good as three pills but i don't remember the statistic now but the point is these dosages have something to do with it and the form has something and if you want the ultimate in placebo you go to the needle right a syringe with some inert a couple of ccs of some inert something and you inject this into a patient well this is such a powerful image in their mind that it's so much stronger than the white pill it's really this graph well i'll show it to you some other time when we have slides the point is the white pill is not as good as the blue pill is not as good as the capsule is not as good as the needle and none of it has any real pharmaceutical quality it's only your belief that makes it real in your body and makes a stronger effect i wanted to see if i could take that idea and apply it to a magic trick and take something that is obviously a fake trick and make it seem real

we spend three billion hours a week playing online games some of you might be thinking that's a lot of time to spend playing games maybe too much time considering how many urgent problems we have to solve in the real world but actually according to my research at the institute for the future it's actually the opposite is true three billion hours a week is not nearly enough game play to solve the world's most urgent problems in fact i believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet we need to increase that total dramatically i've calculated the total we need at twenty one billion hours of game play every week so that's probably a bit of a counterintuitive idea so i'll just say it again let it sync in and if we want to solve problems like hunger poverty climate change global conflict obesity with i believe that we need to aspire to play games online for at least twenty one billion hours a week by the end of the next decade now i'm serious i am here's why this

crinkle of the eyes up and around the mouth is the sign of optimism and the highbrls up is surprised this is a gamer who's on the verge of something called an epic wind no well you heard of that okay good so we have some gamers among us so an epic win is an outcome that is so extraordinarily positive you had no idea it was even possible until you achieved it it was almost beyond the threshold of imagination and when you get there you're shocked to discover what you're truly capable of that's an epic win this is a gamer on the verge of an ethic win and this is the face that we need to see on millions of problem solvers all over the world as we try to tackle the obstacles of the next century the face of someone who against all odds is on the verge of an epic win now unfortunately this is more of the face that we see in everyday life now as we try to tackle urgent problems this is what i call the i'm not good at life face and this is actually me making it can you see it yes good this is actually me making the i'm not good at life face this is a piece of graffiti in my old neighborhood in berkeley california where i did my phd on why we're better in games than we are in real life and this is a problem that a lot of gamers have we feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games and i don't mean just good as in successful although it's part of it we do achieve more in game worlds but i also mean good as in motivated to do something that matters inspired to collaborate and to cooperate when we're in game worlds i believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves the most likely to help at a moment notice the most likely to stick with a problem as long as it takes to get up after failure and try again and in real life when we face failure when we confront obstacles we often don't feel that way we feel overcome we feel overwhelmed we feel anxious may be depressed frustrated or cynical we never have this feelings from we're playing games they just don't exist in games so that's what i wanted to study when i was a graduate student what about games makes it impossible to feel that we can't achieve everything how can we take those feelings from games and apply them to real world work so i looked at games like world of warcraft which is really the ideal collaborative problem solving environment and i started to notice a few things that make epequins so possible in allline worlds so the first thing is whenever you show up in one of these allline games especially in world of worecraft there are lots and lots of different characters who are willing to trust you with a world saving mission right away but not just any mission it's a mission that is perfectly matched with your current level in the game right so you can do it they never give you a challenge that you can't achieve but it is on the verge of what you're capable of so you have to try hard but there's no unemployment in world of warcraft there's no sitting around bringing your hands there is always something specific and important to be done and there are also tons of collaborators everywhere you go hundreds of thousands of people ready to work with you to achieve your epic mission that's not something we have in real life that easily the sense that at our fingertips are tons of collaborators and also this epic story this inspiring story of why were there and what we're doing and then we get all this positive feedback you guys have heard of leveling up and plus one strength plus ones intelligence we don't get the kind of constant feedback in real life when i get off the stage i'm not going to have plus one speaking and plus one crazy idea plus twenty crazy idea i don't get that feedback in real life now the problem with collaborative online environments like world of warcraft is that it's so satisfying to be on the verge of an epic one all the time that we decide to spend all our time in these game worlds it's just better than reality so

[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3659049)[0m that's ted right here we have a machine a big machine a cool tedish machine and it's a time machine and everyone in this room's again into it and you can go backwards you can go forwards you cannot stay where you are and i wonder what you'd choose because i've been asking my friends this question a lot lately and they all want to go back i don't know i want to go back before there were automobiles or twitter or american idle i don't know i'm convinced that there's some sort of pull and nostalgia to wishful thinking and i understand that i'm not part of that crowd i have to say but i don't want to go back and it's not because i'm adventurous it's because possibilities on this planet they don't go back they go forward so i want to get in the machine and i want to go forward this is the greatest time there's ever been on this planet by any measure that you wish to choose health wealth but mobility opportunity declining rates of disease there's never been a time like this my great grandparents died all of them by the time they were sixty my grandparents pushed that number to seventy my parents were closing in our navy so they're better be it they're better be a nine in the beginning of my death number but it's not even about people like us because now this is a bigger deal than that a kid born in new delhi today can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world did one hundred years ago think about that it's an incredible fact and why is it true smallpox smallpox killed billions of people on this planet it reshaped the demography of the globe in a way that no more ever has it's gone now it's vanished we've vanquished it both in the rich world diseases that threatened millions of us just a generation ago no longer exists hardly dipheria rebella polio does anyone even know what those things are vaccines modern medicine our ability to feed billions of people those are triumphs of the scientific method into my mind the scientific method trying stuff out seeing if it works changing it when it doesn't is one of the great accomplishments of humanity so that's the good news unfortunately that's all the good news because there's some other problems and they've been mentioned many times and one of them is that despite all the accomplishments a billion people go to bed hungry in this world every day that number is rising and it's rising really rapidly and it's discraceful and not only that we've used our imagination to thoroughly trash this globe potable water arable land rainforests oil gas they're going away and they're going away soon and unless we innovate our way out of this mess we're going away to so the question is can we do that and i think we can i think it's clear that we can make food that will feed billions of people without raping the land that they live on i think we can power this world with energy that doesn't also destroy it i really do believe that and no it ain't wishful thinking but here's the thing that keeps me up at night one of the things that keeps me up at night we've never needed progress in science more than we need it right now never and we've also never been in a position to deploy it properly in the way that we can today we're on the verge of amazing amazing events in many fields and yet i actually think we'd have to go back hundreds three hundred years before the enlightenment to find a time when we battle progress when we thought about these things more vigorously on more fronts than we do now people wrap themselves in their beliefs and they do it so tightly that you can't set them free not even the truth will set them free and listen everyone's entitled to their opinion they're even entitled to their opinion about progress but you know you're not entitled to you're not entitled to your own facts sorry you're not and this took me a while to figure out about a decade ago i wrote a story about vaccines from the new yorker a little story and i was amazed to find opposition opposition to what is after all the most effective public health measure in human history i know what to do so i just did what i do i wrote a story and i moved on and soon after that i wrote a story about genetically engineered food same thing only bigger people were going crazy so i wrote a story about that too and i couldn't understand why people thought this was franking foods why they thought moving molecules around in a specific rather than a half hazard way was trespassing on nature's ground but you know i do what i do i wrote this story i moved on i mean i'm a journalist we type we file we go to dinner it's fun but these stories bothered me and i couldn't figure out why and eventually i did and that's because of those fanatics that were driving me crazy weren't actually fanatics at all they were thoughtful people educated people decent people they were exactly like the people in this room and it just disturbed me so much but then i thought you know let's be honest we're at a point in this world but where we don't have the same relationship to progress that we used to talk about it ambivalently we talk about it in ironic terms with little quotes around it progress ok there are reasons for that and i think we know what those reasons are we've lost faith and institutions in authority and sometimes in science itself and there's no reason we should enough you can just say a few names and people will understand a ternoble bopal the challenger viox weapons of mass destruction hanging chads i mean you know you can choose your list there are questions and problems with the people we used to believe we're always right so be skeptical ask questions demand proof demand evidence don't take anything for granted but here's the thing when you get proof you need to accept the proof and we're not that good at doing that and the reason that i can say that is because we're now in an epidemic of fear like one that i've never seen and hope never to see again about twelve years ago there was a story published a horrible story that linked the epidemic of autism to the misles months and rebella vaccine shot very scary tons of studies were done to see if this was true tons of studies should have been done it's in a serious issue the data came back the data came back from the united states from england from sweden from canada and it was all the same no correlation no connection none at all but doesn't matter it doesn't matter because we believe anecdotes we believe what we see what we think we see what makes us feel real but we don't believe a bunch of documents from a government official giving us data and i do understand that i think we all do but you know what
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3659036)[0m i'm going to talk today about energy and climate and that might seem a bit surprising because my full time work of the foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds about the things that we need to invent and deliver to help the poorest two billion live better lives but energy and climate are extremely important to these people in fact more important than to anyone else on the planet the climate getting worse means that many years their crops won't grow there'll be too much rain not enough rain things will change in ways that their fragile environment simply can't support and that leads to starvation it leads to uncertainty it leads to unrest so that the climate changes will be terrible for them also the price of energy is very important to them in fact if you could pick just one thing the lower the price up to reduce poverty by far you would pick energy now the price of energy has come down over time really advanced civilization is based on advances in energy the coal revolution fueled the industrial revolution in the nineteen hundreds we've seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity and that's why we have refrigerators air conditioning we can make modern materials and do so many things and so we're in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world but as we make it cheaper and let's say let's go for making it twice as cheap we need to meet a new constraint and that constraint has to do with co two co two is warming the planet and the equation on co two is actually a very straightforward one if you sum up the co two that gets submitted that leads to a temperature increase and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects the effects on the weather perhaps worse the indirect effects in the natural ecosystems can't adjust to these rapid changes and so you get ecosystem collapses now the exact amount of how you map from a certain increase of co two to what temperature will be and where the positive feedbacks are there's some uncertainty there but not very much and there's certainly uncertainty about how bad those effects will be but they will be extremely bad i asked the top scientists and the several times do we really have to get down to near zero can't we just cut it in half a quarter and the answer is that until we get near to zero the temperature will continue to rise and so that's a big challenge it's very different than saying you know we're a twelve foot high truck trying to get under a ten foot bridge and we can just sort of squeeze under this is something that has to get to zero now we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year over twenty six billion tons for each american it's about twenty tons for people in poor countries it's less than one ton it's an average about five tons for everyone on the planet and somehow we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero it's been constantly going up it's only various economic changes that have even flattened at all so we have to go from rapidly rising to falling and falling all the way to zero this equation has four factors a little bit of multiplication so you've got a thing on the left co two that you want to get to zero and that's going to be based on the number of people the services each person juicy on average the energy on average for each service and the co two being put out a per unit of energy so let's look at each one of these and see how we can get this out into zero probably one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero that's back from high school algebra let's take a look first we've got population the world today has six point eight billion people that's headed up to about nine billion now if we do a really great job on new vaccines healthcare reproductive health services we could lower that by perhaps ten or fifteen percent but there we see an increase of about one point three the second factor is the services we use this encompasses everything the food we clothing tv heating these are very good things getting rid of poverty means providing these services to almost everyone on the planet and it's a great thing for this number to go up in the rich world perhaps the top one billion we probably could cut back and use less but every year this number on average is going to go up and so overall that will more than double the services delivered per person here we have a very basic service do you have lighting in your house to be able to read your homework and then in fact these kids don't so they're going out and reading their schoolwork under the street laps and now efficiency the energy for each service here finally we have some good news we have something that's not going up through various inventions and new ways of doing lighting through different types of cars different ways of building buildings there are a lot of services where you can bring the energy for that service down quite substantially some individual services even bring it down by ninety percent there are other services like how we make fertilizes or how we do our transport where the rooms for improvement are far far less and so overall here if we're optimistic we may get a reduction of a factor of three to even perhaps a factor of sex but for these first three factors now we've gone from twenty six billion to its best maybe thirteen billion tons and that just won't cut it so let's look at this fourth factor there's going to be a key one and this is the amount of co two put out for each unit of energy and so the question is can you actually get that to zero if you burn coal no if you burn natural gas almost every way we make electricity today except for the emerging renewables and nuclear puts out co two and so what we're going to have to do at a global scale is create a new system and so we need energy miracles now when i use the term miracle i don't mean something that's impossible the microprocessors a miracle the personal computers a miracle the internet and services are a miracle so the people here have participated in the creation of many miracles usually we don't have a deadline where you have to get the miracle by a certain date usually just kind of stand by and some come along some don't this is a case where we actually have to drive a full speed and get a miracle in a pretty tight timeline now i thought how could i really capture this is there's some kind of natural illustration some demonstration that would grab people's imagination here i thought back to a year ago when i brought mosquitoes and somehow people enjoyed that it really got them involved in the idea of you know there are people who lived in mosquitoes so with energy i like to come up with is this i decided that releasing fireflies

then when i closed my finger same thing as i moved back this motion kind of covers the moving back of my finger i take this hand away you give the knife out there is a trick you can do for your

mind that it's so much stronger than the white pill it's really this graph well i'll show it to you some other time when we have slides the point is the white pill is not as good as the blue pill is not as good as the capsule is not as good as the needle and none of it has any real pharmaceutical quality it's only your belief that makes it real in your body and makes a stronger effect i wanted to see if i could take that idea and apply it to a magic trick and take something that is obviously a fake trick and make it seem real and we know from that study that when you want reality you go to the needle this is a seven inch hatpin it's very very sharp and i'm going to just sterilize it a tiny bit ok this is really my flesh this is not damien's special grown flesh that's my skin right there this is not a hollywood special effect i'm going to pierce my skin and run this needle through to the other side if you're queasy if you faint easily i was doing this for some friends in the hotel room last night and some people that i didn't know and one woman almost passed out so i suggest if you get queasy easy to look awave for about the next thirty in fact you know i'll do the first bad part behind it you'll get to see you can look away to if you'd like to so here is what happens right here at the beginning of my flesh at the lower part of my arm i just make a little pierce i'm sorry man i'm freaking it out ok and then just threw my skin a tiny bit and out the other side like this
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3659047)[0m now for some time i have been interested in the placebo effect which might seem like an odd thing for a magician to be interested in unless you think of it in the terms that i do which is something fake is believed in enough by somebody that it becomes something real in other words sugar pills have a measurable effect in certain kinds of studies the placebo effect just because the person thinks what's happening to them is a pharmaceutical or some sort of for pain management for example if they believe it enough there's a measurable effect in the body called the placebo effect something fake becomes something real because of someone's perception of it in order for us to understand each other i want to start by showing you a rudimentary very simple magic trick and i'm going to show you how it works this trick that's been in every children's magic book since at least the nineteen fifties i learned myself from cub scout magic in the nineteen seventies so i'll do it for you and then i'll explain it and then i'll explain why i explained it ok so here's what happens the life which you could examine my hand which you could examine i was going to hold the knife in my fish like this i get my sleeve back and to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve i'm just going to squeeze my wrist right here that way you can see that at no time can anything travel as long as i'm squeezing there nothing can go up or down my sleep and the object of this is quite simple i'm going to open my hand and hopefully if all as well my pure animal magnetism will hold the knife in fact it's held so tightly in place that i can shake it and the knife does not come off nothing goes up or down my sleeve no trickery and you can examine everything ca so this is a trick that i often teach to young children that are interested in magic because you can learn a great deal about deception by studying this even though it's a very simple trick methodlogically probably many of you in the room know this trick what happens is this i hold the night in my hand and i say i'm going to grab all of my risk to make sure nothing goes up and down my sleeve that is a lie the reason i'm holding on to my risk is because that's actually the secret of the illusion in a moment when my hand moves from facing you to being away from you this finger right here my index fingers are just going to shift from where it is to a position pointing out like this nice one someone who didn't have a childhood out there so it goes like this from here right and as i move around my finger shift so we can talk about why this is deceptive why you don't notice there are only three fingers down here because the mine in the way it processes information it doesn't count one two three groups them but that's not really what this is about right and then i open my hand obviously it's clinging there not by animal magnetism but by chic canary next finger being there and then when i closed my finger same thing as i moved back this motion kind of covers the moving back of my finger i take this hand away you give the knife out there is a trick you can do for your friends and neighbors and thanks now what does that have to do with the perceval effect well i read a study a year or so ago that really blew my mind wide open i'm not a doctor or a researcher so this to me was an astonishing thing it turns out that if you administer a placebo in the form of a white pill that's like aspirin shaped just a round white pill it has some certain measurable effect but if you change the form that you give the placebo in like you make a smaller pill and color it blue and stamp a letter into it it is actually measurably more effective even though neither one of these things has any pharmaceutical there sugar pills but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill they're going to be about what that really flit meown turns out though that's not even where it stops if you have capsules they're more effective than tablets in any form a colored capsule that's yellow on one end and red on the other is better than a white capsule dosage has something to do with this you know one pill twice a day is not as good as three pills but i don't remember the statistic now but the point is these dosages have something to do with it and the form has something and if you want the ultimate in placebo you go to the needle right a syringe with some inert a couple of ccs of some inert something and you inject this into a patient well this is such a powerful image in their mind that it's so much stronger than the white pill it's really this graph well i'll show it to you some other time when we have slides the point is the white pill is not as good as the blue pill is

man i'm freaking it out ok and then just threw my skin a tiny bit and out the other side like this now essentially we're in the same position we were in with the knife trick
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3659049)[0m that's ted right here we have a machine a big machine a cool tedish machine and it's a time machine and everyone in this room's again into it and you can go backwards you can go forwards you cannot stay where you are and i wonder what you'd choose because i've been asking my friends this question a lot lately and they all want to go back i don't know i want to go back before there were automobiles or twitter or american idle i don't know i'm convinced that there's some sort of pull and nostalgia to wishful thinking and i understand that i'm not part of that crowd i have to say but i don't want to go back and it's not because i'm adventurous it's because possibilities on this planet they don't go back they go forward so i want to get in the machine and i want to go forward this is the greatest time there's ever been on this planet by any measure that you wish to choose health wealth but mobility opportunity declining rates of disease there's never been a time like this my great grandparents died all of them by the time they were sixty my grandparents pushed that number to seventy my parents were closing in our navy so they're better be it they're better be a nine in the beginning of my death number but it's not even about people like us because now this is a bigger deal than that a kid born in new delhi today can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world did one hundred years ago think about that it's an incredible fact and why is it true smallpox smallpox killed billions of people on this planet it reshaped the demography of the globe in a way that no more ever has it's gone now it's vanished we've vanquished it both in the rich world diseases that threatened millions of us just a generation ago no longer exists hardly dipheria rebella polio does anyone even know what those things are vaccines modern medicine our ability to feed billions of people those are triumphs of the scientific method into my mind the scientific method trying stuff out seeing if it works changing it when it doesn't is one of the great accomplishments of humanity so that's the good news unfortunately that's all the good news because there's some other problems and they've been mentioned many times and one of them is that despite all the accomplishments a billion people go to bed hungry in this world every day that number is rising and it's rising really rapidly and it's discraceful and not only that we've used our imagination to thoroughly trash this globe potable water arable land rainforests oil gas they're going away and they're going away soon and unless we innovate our way out of this mess we're going away to so the question is can we do that and i think we can i think it's clear that we can make food that will feed billions of people without raping the land that they live on i think we can power this world with energy that doesn't also destroy it i really do believe that and no it ain't wishful thinking but here's the thing that keeps me up at night one of the things that keeps me up at night we've never needed progress in science more than we need it right now never and we've also never been in a position to deploy it properly in the way that we can today we're on the verge of amazing amazing events in many fields and yet i actually think we'd have to go back hundreds three hundred years before the enlightenment to find a time when we battle progress when we thought about these things more vigorously on more fronts than we do now people wrap themselves in their beliefs and they do it so tightly that you can't set them free not even the truth will set them free and listen everyone's entitled to their opinion they're even entitled to their opinion about progress but you know you're not entitled to you're not entitled to your own facts sorry you're not and this took me a while to figure out about a decade ago i wrote a story about vaccines from the new yorker a little story and i was amazed to find opposition opposition to what is after all the most effective public health measure in human history i know what to do so i just did what i do i wrote a story and i moved on and soon after that i wrote a story about genetically engineered food same thing only bigger people were going crazy so i wrote a story about that too and i couldn't understand why people thought this was franking foods why they thought moving molecules around in a specific rather than a half hazard way was trespassing on nature's ground but you know i do what i do i wrote this story i moved on i mean i'm a journalist we type we file we go to dinner it's fun but these stories bothered me and i couldn't figure out why and eventually i did and that's because of those fanatics that were driving me crazy weren't actually fanatics at all they were thoughtful people educated people decent people they were exactly like the people in this room and it just disturbed me so much but then i thought you know let's be honest we're at a point in this world but where we don't have the same relationship to progress that we used to talk about it ambivalently we talk about it in ironic terms with little quotes around it progress ok there are reasons for that and i think we know what those reasons are we've lost faith and institutions in authority and sometimes in science itself and there's no reason we should enough you can just say a few names and people will understand a ternoble bopal the challenger viox weapons of mass destruction hanging chads i mean you know you can choose your list there are questions and problems with the people we used to believe we're always right so be skeptical ask questions demand proof demand evidence don't take anything for granted but here's the thing when you get proof you need to accept the proof and we're not that good at doing that and the reason that i can say that is because we're now in an epidemic of fear like one that i've never seen and hope never to see again about twelve years ago there was a story published a horrible story that linked the epidemic of autism to the misles months and rebella vaccine shot very scary tons of studies were done to see if this was true tons of studies should have been done it's in a serious issue the data came back the data came back from the united states from england from sweden from canada and it was all the same no correlation no connection none at all but doesn't matter it doesn't matter because we believe anecdotes we believe what we see what we think we see what makes us feel real but we don't believe a bunch of documents from a government official giving us data and i do understand that i think we all do but you know what the result of that has been disastrous disasters because here's a fact the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the vaccine rate for musels is going down that is disgraceful and we should be ashamed of ourselves it's horrible what kind of a thing happened that we could do that now
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3659054)[0m i'd like to share with you a discovery that i made a few months ago while writing an article for italian wired i always keep my sars handy never i'm writing anything but i'd already finished editing the peace and i realized that i had never once in my life looked up the word disabled to see what i'd find let me read you the entry disabled additive crippled helpless useless erect it stalled mamed wounded mangled lame mutilated run down worn out weakened impotent castrated paralyzed handicapped senile the crap it laid up done up done for done in cracked up counted out see also hurt useless and weak antony healthy strong capable i was reading this list out loud to a friend at first was laughing it was so ludicrous but i had just gotten passed mangled and my voice broke and i had to stop and collect myself from the emotional shock an impact that the assault from these words unleashed you know of course this is my ragedy old sars i'm thinking this must be an ancient printate right but in fact the printate was the early nineteen eighties when i would have been starting primary school and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as related to the other kids in the world around me and needed to say thank god i wasn't using it the sorus back then i mean from this entry it would seem that i was born into a world that perceived someone like me to have nothing positive whatsoever going for them when in fact today i'm celebrated for the opportunities and adventures my life have prepared so i immediately went to look up to two thousand and nine online edition expecting to find a revision worth noting here's the updated version of this entry unfortunately it's not much better i find the last two words undernear ant noms particularly unsettling hole and hold them so it's not just about the words it's what we believe about people when we name them with these words it's about the values behind the words and how we construct those values our language affects our thinking and how we view the world and how we view other people in fact many ancient societies including the greeks and the romans believed that to utter occurse verbally was so powerful because to say the thing out loud brought it into existence so what reality do we want to call into existence a person who is limited or a person who is empowered by casually doing something a symbol is naming a person a child we might be putting kids and casting shadows on their power wouldn't we want to open doors for them instead one such person who opened doors for me was my child a doctor at the aipant institute in wilmington delaware his name is doctor pizzatelo an italian american whose name apparently was too difficult for most americans to pronounce so he went by doctor p and doctor p always were really colorful booties and had the very perfect disposition to work with children i loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital which the exception of my physical therapy sessions i had to do what seemed like in numerable repetitions of exercises with these thick elastic band different colors you know to help build up my leg muscles and i hated these bands more than anything i hated them had names of them i hated them and you know i was already barging at a five year old child with doctor pe to try to get out of doing these exercises unsuccessfully of course and one day he came in to my session exhaustive and forgiving with these sessions and he said to me wow you are such a strong powerful little girl i think you're going to break one of those bands when you do break it i'm going to give you one hundred bucks now of course this was the simple bloy on doctor pe's part to get me to do the exercise i didn't want to do before the prospect of being the richest five year old in the second floor ward but what he effectively did for me was reshape an awful daily occurrence into a new and promising experience for me and i have to wonder today to what extent his vision and his declaration of me as a strong and powerful little girl shaped my own view of myself as an inherently strong powerful and athletic person well into the future this is an example of how adults and positions of power can ignite the power of a child but in the previous instances of those far century you know our language isn't allowing us to evolve into the reality that we would all want now the possibility of an individual to see themselves is capable our language hasn't caught up with the changes in our society many of which have been brought about by technology certainly for a medical standpoint my legs laser surgery for vision impairment titanium needs and hip replacements for aging bodies that are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities and move beyond the limits that nature imposed on them not to mention social networking platforms allows people to self identify to claim their own descriptions of themselves so they can go alone with global groups of their own choosing so perhaps technology is revealing more clearly to us now what has always been a truth that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest asset the human ability to adapt is an interesting thing because people have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity and i'm going to make an admission this phrase never sat right with me and i always felt an easy trying to answer people's questions about it and i think i'm starting to figure out why implicit in this phrase of overcoming adversity is the idea that success or happiness is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience unscathed or unmarked by the experience as if my successes in life have come about from an ability to side step or circum navigate to presume pitballs of a life with prosthetics or what other people perceive as my disability but in fact we are changed we are marked of course by a challenge whether physically emotionally or both and i'm going to suggest that this is a good thing adversity isn't an obstacle that we need to get around in order to resume living our lives it's part of our life
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3659050)[0m so i've known a lot of fish in my life i've loved only too the first one was it was more like a passionate affair it was a beautiful fish a flavorful textured me the best seller on the menu what a fish even better it was farm raised to the supposed highest standards of sustainability so you can feel good about selling it i was in a relationship with this beauty for several months one day the head of the company called and as if i'd speak out an event about the farm sustainability absolutely i said here is a company trying to solve but what's become this unimaginable problem for ashefs how do we keep fish on our menus for the past fifty years we've been fishing the seas like we clear cut forests it's hard to overstate the destruction ninety percent of large fish the ones we love the tunas the hellbits the salmon's swordfish the collapse there's nothing left so for better for worse agriculture fish farming part of our future a lot of arguments against it fish farms pollute most of them do anyway and they're inefficient take tuna a major drawback it's got a feed conversion ratio of fifteen to one that means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish to get you one pound a farm tuna not very sustainable it doesn't taste very good either so here finally it was a company trying to do it right i wanted to support the day before the event i called they had a pr for the company let's call him done donna said just to get the factor you guys are famous for farming so far out to see you don't pollute that's where he said we're so far out the waste of my fish gets distributed not concentrated and then he added are basically a world into ourselves a few conversion ratio two point five to one he said best in the business two point five to one great two point five what what what do you feed sustainable proteins he said great i said got off the phone and that night i was lying in bed and i thought what the hell is a sustainable protein so the next day just before the event i called down i said down what are some examples of sustainable proteins he said even know he would ask around well i got on the phone and a few people in the company no one could give me a straight answer until finally i got on the phone with the head biologist let's call him down to donna said what are some examples of sustainable proteins well we mentioned some algaees and some fish meals and then he said chicken palats as a chicken pox he said yeah feather skin bone meal scraps dried and processed into feat he said what percentage of your feed is chicken thinking two percent what's about thirty percent he said i said don what's sustainable about feeding chicken fish there's a long pause on the line and he said there's just too much chicken in the world i fell out of love with this fish now not because some self righteous goody too shoes foody i actually am and i fell out of love with this fish because i sort of got after that conversation the fish tasted like chicken the second fish what's a different kind of love story it's the romantic kind a kind where the more you get to know your fish you love the fish i first ate at a restaurant in southern spain a journalist friend have been talking about this fish for a long time she kind of set us up ok it came to the table a bright almost simmering light color the chef had overcooked it like twice amazingly it was still delicious who can make a fish taste good after it's been overcooked i can't but this guy can't let's call him mego actually his name is mego and now he didn't cook the fish and he's not a chef at least in the way that you and i understand is a biologist at vetla pama it's a fish farm in the southwestern corner of spain it's at the tip of the guala cavere river until the nineteen eighties the farm was in the hands of the argentinians they raised beef cattle what was essentially wetlands they did it by training land they built this intricate series of canals and they pushed water off the land and out into the river well it couldn't make it work not economically and ecologically it was disaster killed ninety percent of the birds which for this place is a lot of birds and so in nineteen eighty two a spanish company with an environmental conscience purchased the land what did they do they reverse the flow of water they literally flip the switch instead of pushing water out they used the channels to pull water back in they flooded the canous they created a twenty seven thousand acre fish fund up bas mallet shrimp wheel any in the process negal and this company it completely reversed the ecological destruction now the farm is incredible i mean you've never seen anything like this you stare out at a horizon that is a million miles away and all you see are flooded canals and this thick rich marshland i was there not long ago with me and he's an amazing guy like three parts charles darwin and one part crocodile done be ok but here we are slowing through the wetland you know i'm panting and sweating i'm mut up to my knees and he is commly conducting a biology lecture here he's pointing out a rare black shoulder kite now he's mentioning the mineral needs of phytoplankton and here here he sees a grouping pattern that reminds him of the tanzanian giraff it turns out megal spent the better part of his career in the macumi national park in africa i asked him how he became such an expert on fish he said fish i don't know anything about fish i'm an expert in relationships and then he's off launching the more talk about rare birds and algaees and strange aquatic plants and don't get me wrong i was really fascinating you know the biotic community unplugged kind of thing you know it's great
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3659036)[0m i'm going to talk today about energy and climate and that might seem a bit surprising because my full time work of the foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds about the things that we need to invent and deliver to help the poorest two billion live better lives but energy and climate are extremely important to these people in fact more important than to anyone else on the planet the climate getting worse means that many years their crops won't grow there'll be too much rain not enough rain things will change in ways that their fragile environment simply can't support and that leads to starvation it leads to uncertainty it leads to unrest so that the climate changes will be terrible for them also the price of energy is very important to them in fact if you could pick just one thing the lower the price up to reduce poverty by far you would pick energy now the price of energy has come down over time really advanced civilization is based on advances in energy the coal revolution fueled the industrial revolution in the nineteen hundreds we've seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity and that's why we have refrigerators air conditioning we can make modern materials and do so many things and so we're in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world but as we make it cheaper and let's say let's go for making it twice as cheap we need to meet a new constraint and that constraint has to do with co two co two is warming the planet and the equation on co two is actually a very straightforward one if you sum up the co two that gets submitted that leads to a temperature increase and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects the effects on the weather perhaps worse the indirect effects in the natural ecosystems can't adjust to these rapid changes and so you get ecosystem collapses now the exact amount of how you map from a certain increase of co two to what temperature will be and where the positive feedbacks are there's some uncertainty there but not very much and there's certainly uncertainty about how bad those effects will be but they will be extremely bad i asked the top scientists and the several times do we really have to get down to near zero can't we just cut it in half a quarter and the answer is that until we get near to zero the temperature will continue to rise and so that's a big challenge it's very different than saying you know we're a twelve foot high truck trying to get under a ten foot bridge and we can just sort of squeeze under this is something that has to get to zero now we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year over twenty six billion tons for each american it's about twenty tons for people in poor countries it's less than one ton it's an average about five tons for everyone on the planet and somehow we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero it's been constantly going up it's only various economic changes that have even flattened at all so we have to go from rapidly rising to falling and falling all the way to zero this equation has four factors a little bit of multiplication so you've got a thing on the left co two that you want to get to zero and that's going to be based on the number of people the services each person juicy on average the energy on average for each service and the co two being put out a per unit of energy so let's look at each one of these and see how we can get this out into zero probably one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero that's back from high school algebra let's take a look first we've got population the world today has six point eight billion people that's headed up to about nine billion now if we do a really great job on new vaccines healthcare reproductive health services we could lower that by perhaps ten or fifteen percent but there we see an increase of about one point three the second factor is the services we use this encompasses everything the food we clothing tv heating these are very good things getting rid of poverty means providing these services to almost everyone on the planet and it's a great thing for this number to go up in the rich world perhaps the top one billion we probably could cut back and use less but every year this number on average is going to go up and so overall that will more than double the services delivered per person here we have a very basic service do you have lighting in your house to be able to read your homework and then in fact these kids don't so they're going out and reading their schoolwork under the street laps and now efficiency the energy for each service here finally we have some good news we have something that's not going up through various inventions and new ways of doing lighting through different types of cars different ways of building buildings there are a lot of services where you can bring the energy for that service down quite substantially some individual services even bring it down by ninety percent there are other services like how we make fertilizes or how we do our transport where the rooms for improvement are far far less and so overall here if we're optimistic we may get a reduction of a factor of three to even perhaps a factor of sex but for these first three factors now we've gone from twenty six billion to its best maybe thirteen billion tons and that just won't cut it so let's look at this fourth factor there's going to be a key one and this is the amount of co two put out for each unit of energy and so the question is can you actually get that to zero if you burn coal no if you burn natural gas almost every way we make electricity today except for the emerging renewables and nuclear puts out co two and so what we're going to have to do at a global scale is create a new system and so we need energy miracles now when i use the term miracle i don't mean something that's impossible the microprocessors a miracle the personal computers a miracle the internet and services are a miracle so the people here have participated in the creation of many miracles usually we don't have a deadline where you have to get the miracle by a certain date usually just kind of stand by and some come along some don't this is a case where we actually have to drive a full speed and get a miracle in a pretty tight timeline now i thought how could i really capture this is there's some kind of natural illustration some demonstration that would grab people's imagination here i thought back to a year ago when i brought mosquitoes and somehow people enjoyed that it really got them involved in the idea of you know there are people who lived in mosquitoes so with energy i like to come up with is this i decided that releasing fireflies would be my contribution to the environment here this year so here we have some natural fly flies i'm told they don't bite in fact they might even not even leave that jar now there's all sorts of geeky solutions like that one but they don't really add up too much we need solutions either one or several that have

one two three groups them but that's not really what this is about right and then i open my hand obviously it's clinging there not by animal magnetism but by chic canary next finger being there and then when i closed my finger same thing as i moved back this motion kind of covers the moving back of my finger i take this hand away you give the knife out there is a trick you can do for your friends and neighbors and thanks now what does that have to do with the perceval effect well i read a study a year or so ago that really blew my mind wide open i'm not a doctor or a researcher so this to me was an astonishing thing it turns out that if you administer a placebo in the form of a white pill that's like aspirin shaped just a round white pill it has some certain measurable effect but if you change the form that you give the placebo in like you make a smaller pill and color it blue and stamp a letter into it it is actually measurably more effective even though neither one of these things has any pharmaceutical there sugar pills but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill they're going to be about what that really flit meown turns out though that's not even where it stops if you have capsules they're more effective than tablets in any form a colored capsule that's yellow on one end and red on the other is better than a white capsule dosage has something to do with this you know one pill twice a day is not as good as three pills but i don't remember the statistic now but the point is these dosages have something to do with it and the form has something and if you want the ultimate in placebo you go to the needle right a syringe with some inert a couple of ccs of some inert something and you inject this into a patient well this is such a powerful image in their mind that it's so much stronger than the white pill it's really this graph well i'll show it to you some other time when we have slides the point is the white pill is not as good as the blue pill is not as good as the capsule is not as good as the needle and none of it has any real pharmaceutical quality it's only your belief that makes it real in your body and makes a stronger effect i wanted to see if i could take that idea and apply it to a magic trick and take something that is obviously a fake trick and make it seem real and we know from that study that when you want reality you go to the needle this is a seven inch hatpin it's very very sharp and i'm going to just sterilize it a tiny bit ok this is really my flesh this is not damien's special grown flesh that's my skin right there this is not a hollywood special effect i'm going to pierce my skin and run this needle through to the other side if you're queasy if you faint easily i was doing this for some friends in the hotel room last night and some people that i didn't know and one woman almost passed out so i suggest if you get queasy easy to look awave for about the next thirty in fact you know i'll do the first bad part behind it you'll get to see you can look away to if you'd like to so here is what happens right here at the beginning of my flesh at the lower part of my arm i just make a little pierce i'm sorry man i'm freaking it out ok and then just threw my skin a tiny bit and out the other side like this now essentially we're in the same position we were in with the knife trick and sort of but you can't count my fingers right now kenya so let me show them to you that's one two three four five hands i know what people think when they see this thing well he would certainly not dumb enough to stab himself through the skin to entertain us for a few minutes so let me give you a little peek
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3659047)[0m now for some time i have been interested in the placebo effect which might seem like an odd thing for a magician to be interested in unless you think of it in the terms that i do which is something fake is believed in enough by somebody that it becomes something real in other words sugar pills have a measurable effect in certain kinds of studies the placebo effect just because the person thinks what's happening to them is a pharmaceutical or some sort of for pain management for example if they believe it enough there's a measurable effect in the body called the placebo effect something fake becomes something real because of someone's perception of it in order for us to understand each other i want to start by showing you a rudimentary very simple magic trick and i'm going to show you how it works this trick that's been in every children's magic book since at least the nineteen fifties i learned myself from cub scout magic in the nineteen seventies so i'll do it for you and then i'll explain it and then i'll explain why i explained it ok so here's what happens the life which you could examine my hand which you could examine i was going to hold the knife in my fish like this i get my sleeve back and to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve i'm just going to squeeze my wrist right here that way you can see that at no time can anything travel as long as i'm squeezing there nothing can go up or down my sleep and the object of this is quite simple i'm going to open my hand and hopefully if all as well my pure animal magnetism will hold the knife in fact it's held so tightly in place that i can shake it and the knife does not come off nothing goes up or down my sleeve no trickery and you can examine everything ca so this is a trick that i often teach to young children that are interested in magic because you can learn a great deal about deception by studying this even though it's a very simple trick methodlogically probably many of you in the room know this trick what happens is this i hold the night in my hand and i say i'm going to grab all of my risk to make sure nothing goes up and down my sleeve that is a lie the reason i'm holding on to my risk is because that's actually the secret of the illusion in a moment when my hand moves from facing you to being away from you this finger right here my index fingers are just going to shift from where it is to a position pointing out like this nice one someone who didn't have a childhood out there so it goes like this from here right and as i move around my finger shift so we can talk about why this is deceptive why you don't notice there are only three fingers down here because the mine in the way it processes information it doesn't count

[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3659036)[0m i'm going to talk today about energy and climate and that might seem a bit surprising because my full time work of the foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds about the things that we need to invent and deliver to help the poorest two billion live better lives but energy and climate are extremely important to these people in fact more important than to anyone else on the planet the climate getting worse means that many years their crops won't grow there'll be too much rain not enough rain things will change in ways that their fragile environment simply can't support and that leads to starvation it leads to uncertainty it leads to unrest so that the climate changes will be terrible for them also the price of energy is very important to them in fact if you could pick just one thing the lower the price up to reduce poverty by far you would pick energy now the price of energy has come down over time really advanced civilization is based on advances in energy the coal revolution fueled the industrial revolution in the nineteen hundreds we've seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity and that's why we have refrigerators air conditioning we can make modern materials and do so many things and so we're in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world but as we make it cheaper and let's say let's go for making it twice as cheap we need to meet a new constraint and that constraint has to do with co two co two is warming the planet and the equation on co two is actually a very straightforward one if you sum up the co two that gets submitted that leads to a temperature increase and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects the effects on the weather perhaps worse the indirect effects in the natural ecosystems can't adjust to these rapid changes and so you get ecosystem collapses now the exact amount of how you map from a certain increase of co two to what temperature will be and where the positive feedbacks are there's some uncertainty there but not very much and there's certainly uncertainty about how bad those effects will be but they will be extremely bad i asked the top scientists and the several times do we really have to get down to near zero can't we just cut it in half a quarter and the answer is that until we get near to zero the temperature will continue to rise and so that's a big challenge it's very different than saying you know we're a twelve foot high truck trying to get under a ten foot bridge and we can just sort of squeeze under this is something that has to get to zero now we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year over twenty six billion tons for each american it's about twenty tons for people in poor countries it's less than one ton it's an average about five tons for everyone on the planet and somehow we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero it's been constantly going up it's only various economic changes that have even flattened at all so we have to go from rapidly rising to falling and falling all the way to zero this equation has four factors a little bit of multiplication so you've got a thing on the left co two that you want to get to zero and that's going to be based on the number of people the services each person juicy on average the energy on average for each service and the co two being put out a per unit of energy so let's look at each one of these and see how we can get this out into zero probably one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero that's back from high school algebra let's take a look first we've got population the world today has six point eight billion people that's headed up to about nine billion now if we do a really great job on new vaccines healthcare reproductive health services we could lower that by perhaps ten or fifteen percent but there we see an increase of about one point three the second factor is the services we use this encompasses everything the food we clothing tv heating these are very good things getting rid of poverty means providing these services to almost everyone on the planet and it's a great thing for this number to go up in the rich world perhaps the top one billion we probably could cut back and use less but every year this number on average is going to go up and so overall that will more than double the services delivered per person here we have a very basic service do you have lighting in your house to be able to read your homework and then in fact these kids don't so they're going out and reading their schoolwork under the street laps and now efficiency the energy for each service here finally we have some good news we have something that's not going up through various inventions and new ways of doing lighting through different types of cars different ways of building buildings there are a lot of services where you can bring the energy for that service down quite substantially some individual services even bring it down by ninety percent there are other services like how we make fertilizes or how we do our transport where the rooms for improvement are far far less and so overall here if we're optimistic we may get a reduction of a factor of three to even perhaps a factor of sex but for these first three factors now we've gone from twenty six billion to its best maybe thirteen billion tons and that just won't cut it so let's look at this fourth factor there's going to be a key one and this is the amount of co two put out for each unit of energy and so the question is can you actually get that to zero if you burn coal no if you burn natural gas almost every way we make electricity today except for the emerging renewables and nuclear puts out co two and so what we're going to have to do at a global scale is create a new system and so we need energy miracles now when i use the term miracle i don't mean something that's impossible the microprocessors a miracle the personal computers a miracle the internet and services are a miracle so the people here have participated in the creation of many miracles usually we don't have a deadline where you have to get the miracle by a certain date usually just kind of stand by and some come along some don't this is a case where we actually have to drive a full speed and get a miracle in a pretty tight timeline now i thought how could i really capture this is there's some kind of natural illustration some demonstration that would grab people's imagination here i thought back to a year ago when i brought mosquitoes and somehow people enjoyed that it really got them involved in the idea of you know there are people who lived in mosquitoes so with energy i like to come up with is this i decided that releasing fireflies would be my contribution to the environment here this year so here we have some natural fly flies i'm told they don't bite in fact they might even not even leave that jar now there's all sorts of geeky solutions like that one but they don't really add up too much we need solutions either one or several that have unbelievable scale and unbelievable reliability and although there's many directions of people seeking i really only see five that

go backwards you can go forwards you cannot stay where you are and i wonder what you'd choose because i've been asking my friends this question a lot lately and they all want to go back i don't know i want to go back before there were automobiles or twitter or american idle i don't know i'm convinced that there's some sort of pull and nostalgia to wishful thinking and i understand that i'm not part of that crowd i have to say but i don't want to go back and it's not because i'm adventurous it's because possibilities on this planet they don't go back they go forward so i want to get in the machine and i want to go forward this is the greatest time there's ever been on this planet by any measure that you wish to choose health wealth but mobility opportunity declining rates of disease there's never been a time like this my great grandparents died all of them by the time they were sixty my grandparents pushed that number to seventy my parents were closing in our navy so they're better be it they're better be a nine in the beginning of my death number but it's not even about people like us because now this is a bigger deal than that a kid born in new delhi today can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world did one hundred years ago think about that it's an incredible fact and why is it true smallpox smallpox killed billions of people on this planet it reshaped the demography of the globe in a way that no more ever has it's gone now it's vanished we've vanquished it both in the rich world diseases that threatened millions of us just a generation ago no longer exists hardly dipheria rebella polio does anyone even know what those things are vaccines modern medicine our ability to feed billions of people those are triumphs of the scientific method into my mind the scientific method trying stuff out seeing if it works changing it when it doesn't is one of the great accomplishments of humanity so that's the good news unfortunately that's all the good news because there's some other problems and they've been mentioned many times and one of them is that despite all the accomplishments a billion people go to bed hungry in this world every day that number is rising and it's rising really rapidly and it's discraceful and not only that we've used our imagination to thoroughly trash this globe potable water arable land rainforests oil gas they're going away and they're going away soon and unless we innovate our way out of this mess we're going away to so the question is can we do that and i think we can i think it's clear that we can make food that will feed billions of people without raping the land that they live on i think we can power this world with energy that doesn't also destroy it i really do believe that and no it ain't wishful thinking but here's the thing that keeps me up at night one of the things that keeps me up at night we've never needed progress in science more than we need it right now never and we've also never been in a position to deploy it properly in the way that we can today we're on the verge of amazing amazing events in many fields and yet i actually think we'd have to go back hundreds three hundred years before the enlightenment to find a time when we battle progress when we thought about these things more vigorously on more fronts than we do now people wrap themselves in their beliefs and they do it so tightly that you can't set them free not even the truth will set them free and listen everyone's entitled to their opinion they're even entitled to their opinion about progress but you know you're not entitled to you're not entitled to your own facts sorry you're not and this took me a while to figure out about a decade ago i wrote a story about vaccines from the new yorker a little story and i was amazed to find opposition opposition to what is after all the most effective public health measure in human history i know what to do so i just did what i do i wrote a story and i moved on and soon after that i wrote a story about genetically engineered food same thing only bigger people were going crazy so i wrote a story about that too and i couldn't understand why people thought this was franking foods why they thought moving molecules around in a specific rather than a half hazard way was trespassing on nature's ground but you know i do what i do i wrote this story i moved on i mean i'm a journalist we type we file we go to dinner it's fun but these stories bothered me and i couldn't figure out why and eventually i did and that's because of those fanatics that were driving me crazy weren't actually fanatics at all they were thoughtful people educated people decent people they were exactly like the people in this room and it just disturbed me so much but then i thought you know let's be honest we're at a point in this world but where we don't have the same relationship to progress that we used to talk about it ambivalently we talk about it in ironic terms with little quotes around it progress ok there are reasons for that and i think we know what those reasons are we've lost faith and institutions in authority and sometimes in science itself and there's no reason we should enough you can just say a few names and people will understand a ternoble bopal the challenger viox weapons of mass destruction hanging chads i mean you know you can choose your list there are questions and problems with the people we used to believe we're always right so be skeptical ask questions demand proof demand evidence don't take anything for granted but here's the thing when you get proof you need to accept the proof and we're not that good at doing that and the reason that i can say that is because we're now in an epidemic of fear like one that i've never seen and hope never to see again about twelve years ago there was a story published a horrible story that linked the epidemic of autism to the misles months and rebella vaccine shot very scary tons of studies were done to see if this was true tons of studies should have been done it's in a serious issue the data came back the data came back from the united states from england from sweden from canada and it was all the same no correlation no connection none at all but doesn't matter it doesn't matter because we believe anecdotes we believe what we see what we think we see what makes us feel real but we don't believe a bunch of documents from a government official giving us data and i do understand that i think we all do but you know what the result of that has been disastrous disasters because here's a fact the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the vaccine rate for musels is going down that is disgraceful and we should be ashamed of ourselves it's horrible what kind of a thing happened that we could do that now i understand it i do understand it because who did anyone have museles here it is one person in this audience ever see someone die of museles it doesn't happen very much it doesn't happen in this country at all but it happened one hundred and sixty thousand times in the world last year that's a lot of death of measles twenty an hour but since it didn't happen here we can put it out of our minds and people like gening the carte can go around preaching messages of fear and illiteracy from platforms like oprah and larry king live and they can do it because they don't make causation and correlation they don't understand that these things seem the same but they're almost never the same and it's something we need to learn and we

[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3659045)[0m i'm game i'm a game designer in making games online now for ten years and my goal for the next decade is to try to make it as easy to save the world in real life as it is to save the world in online games now i have a plan for this and it entails convincing more people including all of you to spend more time playing bigger and better games right now we spend three billion hours a week playing online games some of you might be thinking that's a lot of time to spend playing games maybe too much time considering how many urgent problems we have to solve in the real world but actually according to my research at the institute for the future it's actually the opposite is true three billion hours a week is not nearly enough game play to solve the world's most urgent problems in fact i believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet we need to increase that total dramatically i've calculated the total we need at twenty one billion hours of game play every week so that's probably a bit of a counterintuitive idea so i'll just say it again let it sync in and if we want to solve problems like hunger poverty climate change global conflict obesity with i believe that we need to aspire to play games online for at least twenty one billion hours a week by the end of the next decade now i'm serious i am here's why this picture pretty much sums up why i think games are so essential to the future survival of the human species truly this is a portrait by a photographer named phil told dono he wanted to capture the emotion of gaming so we set up a camera in front of gamers while they were playing and this is a classic gaming emotion now if you're not a gamer you might miss some of the nuance in this photo you probably see the sense of urgency a little bit of but fear but intense concentration deep deep focus on tackling a really difficult problem if you are a gamer you will notice a few nuances here the crinkle of the eyes up and around the mouth is the sign of optimism and the highbrls up is surprised this is a gamer who's on the verge of something called an epic wind no well you heard of that okay good so we have some gamers among us so an epic win is an outcome that is so extraordinarily positive you had no idea it was even possible until you achieved it it was almost beyond the threshold of imagination and when you get there you're shocked to discover what you're truly capable of that's an epic win this is a gamer on the verge of an ethic win and this is the face that we need to see on millions of problem solvers all over the world as we try to tackle the obstacles of the next century the face of someone who against all odds is on the verge of an epic win now unfortunately this is more of the face that we see in everyday life now as we try to tackle urgent problems this is what i call the i'm not good at life face and this is actually me making it can you see it yes good this is actually me making the i'm not good at life face this is a piece of graffiti in my old neighborhood in berkeley california where i did my phd on why we're better in games than we are in real life and this is a problem that a lot of gamers have we feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games and i don't mean just good as in successful although it's part of it we do achieve more in game worlds but i also mean good as in motivated to do something that matters inspired to collaborate and to cooperate when we're in game worlds i believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves the most likely to help at a moment notice the most likely to stick with a problem as long as it takes to get up after failure and try again and in real life when we face failure when we confront obstacles we often don't feel that way we feel overcome we feel overwhelmed we feel anxious may be depressed frustrated or cynical we never have this feelings from we're playing games they just don't exist in games so that's what i wanted to study when i was a graduate student what about games makes it impossible to feel that we can't achieve everything how can we take those feelings from games and apply them to real world work so i looked at games like world of warcraft which is really the ideal collaborative problem solving environment and i started to notice a few things that make epequins so possible in allline worlds so the first thing is whenever you show up in one of these allline games especially in world of worecraft there are lots and lots of different characters who are willing to trust you with a world saving mission right away but not just any mission it's a mission that is perfectly matched with your current level in the game right so you can do it they never give you a challenge that you can't achieve but it is on the verge of what you're capable of so you have to try hard but there's no unemployment in world of warcraft there's no sitting around bringing your hands there is always something specific and important to be done and there are also tons of collaborators everywhere you go hundreds of thousands of people ready to work with you to achieve your epic mission that's not something we have in real life that easily the sense that at our fingertips are tons of collaborators and also this epic story this inspiring story of why were there and what we're doing and then we get all this positive feedback you guys have heard of leveling up and plus one strength plus ones intelligence we don't get the kind of constant feedback in real life when i get off the stage i'm not going to have plus one speaking and plus one crazy idea plus twenty crazy idea i don't get that feedback in real life now the problem with collaborative online environments like world of warcraft is that it's so satisfying to be on the verge of an epic one all the time that we decide to spend all our time in these game worlds it's just better than reality so so far collectively all the road of warcraft gamers have spent five point nine three million years solving the virtual problems of asora now that's not necessarily a bad thing it might sound like it's a bad thing but to put that in context five point nine three million years ago was when our earliest primate human ancestors stood up that was the first upright primate ok so when we talk about how much time we're currently investing in playing games the only way it makes sense to even think about it is to talk about time at the magnitude of human evolution which is an extraordinary thing but it's also act because it turns out that by spending all this time playing games we're actually changing what we are capable of as human beings we're evolving to be more collaborative and hardy species this is true i believe this so consider this really interesting statistic i was recently published by a researcher at carnegie mellon university the average young person today in a country with a strong gamer culture will have spent ten thousand hours playing online games by the age of twenty one now ten thousand hours is a really interesting number for two reasons first of all for children in the united states ten thousand and eighty hours is the exact amount of time you will spend in school from fifth grade to high school graduation if you have perfect attendance we have an entire parallel track of education going on where young people are learning as much about what it takes to be a good gamer as they're learning about everything else in school but some of you have probably read malcolm gladwell's new book outliers so you would have heard of his theory of success the ten thousand hour theory of success it's based on this great cognitive science research that if we can master ten thousand hours of effortful study at anything by the age of twenty one we will be virtuoso that it will be as good at whatever we do as the greatest people in the world and so now what we're looking at is an entire generation of young people who are virtuoso gamers so the big question is what exactly our gamer is getting so good at because if we could figure that out we would have a virtually unprecedented human resource on our hands
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3659036)[0m i'm going to talk today about energy and climate and that might seem a bit surprising because my full time work of the foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds about the things that we need to invent and deliver to help the poorest two billion live better lives but energy and climate are extremely important to these people in fact more important than to anyone else on the planet the climate getting worse means that many years their crops won't grow there'll be too much rain not enough rain things will change in ways that their fragile environment simply can't support and that leads to starvation it leads to uncertainty it leads to unrest so that the climate changes will be terrible for them also the price of energy is very important to them in fact if you could pick just one thing the lower the price up to reduce poverty by far you would pick energy now the price of energy has come down over time really advanced civilization is based on advances in energy the coal revolution fueled the industrial revolution in the nineteen hundreds we've seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity and that's why we have refrigerators air conditioning we can make modern materials and do so many things and so we're in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world but as we make it cheaper and let's say let's go for making it twice as cheap we need to meet a new constraint and that constraint has to do with co two co two is warming the planet and the equation on co two is actually a very straightforward one if you sum up the co two that gets submitted that leads to a temperature increase and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects the effects on the weather perhaps worse the indirect effects in the natural ecosystems can't adjust to these rapid changes and so you get ecosystem collapses now the exact amount of how you map from a certain increase of co two to what temperature will be and where the positive feedbacks are there's some uncertainty there but not very much and there's certainly uncertainty about how bad those effects will be but they will be extremely bad i asked the top scientists and the several times do we really have to get down to near zero can't we just cut it in half a quarter and the answer is that until we get near to zero the temperature will continue to rise and so that's a big challenge it's very different than saying you know we're a twelve foot high truck trying to get under a ten foot bridge and we can just sort of squeeze under this is something that has to get to zero now we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year over twenty six billion tons for each american it's about twenty tons for people in poor countries it's less than one ton it's an average about five tons for everyone on the planet and somehow we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero it's been constantly going up it's only various economic changes that have even flattened at all so we have to go from rapidly rising to falling and falling all the way to zero this equation has four factors a little bit of multiplication so you've got a thing on the left co two that you want to get to zero and that's going to be based on the number of people the services each person juicy on average the energy on average for each service and the co two being put out a per unit of energy so let's look at each one of these and see how we can get this out into zero probably one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero that's back from high school algebra let's take a look first we've got population the world today has six point eight billion people that's headed up to about nine billion now if we do a really great job on new vaccines healthcare reproductive health services we could lower that by perhaps ten or fifteen percent but there we see an increase of about one point three the second factor is the services we use this encompasses everything the food we clothing tv heating these are very good things getting rid of poverty means providing these services to almost everyone on the planet and it's a great thing for this number to go up in the rich world perhaps the top one billion we probably could cut back and use less but every year this number on average is going to go up and so overall that will more than double the services delivered per person here we have a very basic service do you have lighting in your house to be able to read your homework and then in fact these kids don't so they're going out and reading their schoolwork under the street laps and now efficiency the energy for each service here finally we have some good news we have something that's not going up through various inventions and new ways of doing lighting through different types of cars different ways of building buildings there are a lot of services where you can bring the energy for that service down quite substantially some individual services even bring it down by ninety percent there are other services like how we make fertilizes or how we do our transport where the rooms for improvement are far far less and so overall here if we're optimistic we may get a reduction of a factor of three to even perhaps a factor of sex but for these first three factors now we've gone from twenty six billion to its best maybe thirteen billion tons and that just won't cut it so let's look at this fourth factor there's going to be a key one and this is the amount of co two put out for each unit of energy and so the question is can you actually get that to zero if you burn coal no if you burn natural gas almost every way we make electricity today except for the emerging renewables and nuclear puts out co two and so what we're going to have to do at a global scale is create a new system and so we need energy miracles now when i use the term miracle i don't mean something that's impossible the microprocessors a miracle the personal computers a miracle the internet and services are a miracle so the people here have participated in the creation of many miracles usually we don't have a deadline where you have to get the miracle by a certain date usually just kind of stand by and some come along some don't this is a case where we actually have to drive a full speed and get a miracle in a pretty tight timeline now i thought how could i really capture this is there's some kind of natural illustration some demonstration that would grab people's imagination here i thought back to a year ago when i brought mosquitoes and somehow people enjoyed that it really got them involved in the idea of you know there are people who lived in mosquitoes so with energy i like to come up with is this i decided that releasing fireflies would be my contribution to the environment here this year so here we have some natural fly flies i'm told they don't bite in fact they might even not even leave that jar now there's all sorts of geeky solutions like that one but they don't really add up too much we need solutions either one or several that have unbelievable scale and unbelievable reliability and although there's many directions of people seeking i really only see five that can achieve the big numbers i've left out time geothermal fusion biopules those may make some contribution and if they can do better than i expect so much the better but my key point here is that we're going to have to work on each of these five and we can't give up any of them because they look daunting because they all that have significant challenges let's look first at the burning fossil fuels either burning coal or burning natural gas what you need to do there it seems like it might be simple but it's not and that's to take all the co two after you burn it going out the flu pressurize it create a liquid put it somewhere and hope it stays there
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3659047)[0m RESETTING HISORY
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3659038)[0m everybody talks about happiness these days i had somebody count the number of books with happiness in the title published in the last five years and they gave up after about forty and there were many more and there is a huge wave of interest in happiness among researchers there is a lot of happiness culturing everybody would like to make people happier but in spread of all this flood of work there are several cognitive traps that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight about happiness and my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive traps this applies to lay people thinking about their own happiness and it applies to scholars thinking about happiness because it turns out we're just as messed up as anybody else's the first of these traps are reluctance to admit complexity it turns out that the word happiness is just not a useful word anymore because we applied to too many different things i think there is one particular meaningful to which we might restrict it but by and large this is something that we'll have to give up and we'll have to adopt a more complicated view of what well being is the second trap is a confusion between experience and memory basically it's between being happy in your life and being happy about your life so happy with your life and those are two very different concepts and they're both lumped in the notion of happiness and the third is it's the focusing illusion and it's the unfortunate fact that we can't think about any circumstance that affects will be without distorting it's important i mean this is a real cognitive prop there's just no way of getting it right now i'd like to start with an example of somebody with a question an answer session after one of my lectures and reported a story and that was a story he said he had been listening to a symphony and it was absolutely glorious music and at the very end of the recording there was a dreadful screeching sound and then he added really quite emotionally and it drew in the whole experience but it happened when it had ruined with the memory of the experience he had had the experience he had had twenty minutes of glorious music they counted for nothing because he was left with the memory the memory was ruined and the memory was all that he had gotten keep what this is telling us really is that we might be thinking of ourselves and other people in terms of two cells there is an experiencing self who lives in the present and knows the present it's capable of re living the past but basically it has only the present it's the experiencing self that the doctor approaches you know when the doctor does it hurt now when i thought you hear and then there is a remembering self and the remembering self is the one that keeps score and maintains the story of our life and it's the one that the doctor approaches in asking the question how have you been feeling lately how is your trip torbania or something like that those are two very different entities the experiencing self and the remembering self and getting confused between them is part of the mess about the notion of happiness now the remembering self is a storyteller and that really starts with a basic a response of our memory it starts immediately we don't only tell stories when we set out to tell stories our memory tells our stories that is what we get to keep from our experiences is a story and let me begin with one example this is an old study those are actual patients undergoing a painful procedure i won't go into detail it's no longer painful these days but it was painful when they when the study was run in the nineteen nineties there is a report on their pain every sixty seconds and here are two patients those are their recordings and you are ask who of them suffered more and it's a very easy question i mean clearly patient be suffered more it's clonoscopy was longer and every a minute of pain that patient a had patient b had and more but now there's another question how much did these patients think they suffer and here is a surprise and the surprise is that patient a had a much worse memory of the clonoscopy the patient b the stories of the clonoscopies were different and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends and neither these stories is very inspiring or great but one of them is distinct but one of them is distinctly worse than the other and the one that is worse is the one where pain was that it speaks at the very end it's a bad story how do we know that because we asked these people after their colonoscopy and much later too how bad was the whole thing in total and it was much worse for aid than for me in memory now this is a direct conflict between the experiencing self and the remembering self from the point of view the experiencing self clearly be at a worst time now what you could do with patient aid and we actually ran clinical experiments and it has been done and it does work you could actually extend the monoscopy of patient aid by just keeping the tubin without driggling it too much that will that will cause the patient to suffer but just a little and much less than before and if you do that for a couple of minutes you have made the experiencing self of patient a will sof and you've made the remembering self of patient a lot better off because now you have a doubt patient a with a better story about his experience what defines a story and that is true of the stories that memory delivers for us and it's also true of the stories that we make up what finds a story changes significant moments and endings endings are very very important and in this case you know the ending dominated now the experiencing self lives its life continuously has moments of experience one after the other and you can ask what happens to these moments and the answer is really straightforward they are lost forever i mean most of the moments of our life when i calculated you know the psychological present is said to be about three seconds long that means that you know in a life there are about six hundred million of them in a month there are about six hundred thousand but most of them don't leave the trace most of them are completely ignored by the remembering self and yet somehow you get the sense that they should count that what happens during these moments of experience is our life it's the finite resource that we are spending where we are on the earth and how to spend it would seem to be relevant but that is not the story that our remembering self keeps for us so we have remembering self and the experiencing self and they're really quite distinct the biggest difference between them is in the handing of time from the point of view of the experiencing self if you have a vacation and the second week is just as good as the first then the two week vacation is twice as good as the one week vacation that's not the way it works at all for the remembering self for the remembering self the two week vacation is barely better than the one week vacation because there are no new memories added you have not changed the story and in this way time is actually the critical variable that distinguishes a remembering self from our experiencing self time has very little impact on the story now the remembering self does more than remember and tell stories it is actually the one that makes decisions because if you have a patient who has had say two clonoscopes with two different surgeons and is deciding which for them to choose then
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3659050)[0m so i've known a lot of fish in my life i've loved only too the first one was it was more like a passionate affair it was a beautiful fish a flavorful textured me the best seller on the menu what a fish even better it was farm raised to the supposed highest standards of sustainability so you can feel good about selling it i was in a relationship with this beauty for several months one day the head of the company called and as if i'd speak out an event about the farm sustainability absolutely i said here is a company trying to solve but what's become this unimaginable problem for ashefs how do we keep fish on our menus for the past fifty years we've been fishing the seas like we clear cut forests it's hard to overstate the destruction ninety percent of large fish the ones we love the tunas the hellbits the salmon's swordfish the collapse there's nothing left so for better for worse agriculture fish farming part of our future a lot of arguments against it fish farms pollute most of them do anyway and they're inefficient take tuna a major drawback it's got a feed conversion ratio of fifteen to one that means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish to get you one pound a farm tuna not very sustainable it doesn't taste very good either so here finally it was a company trying to do it right i wanted to support the day before the event i called they had a pr for the company let's call him done donna said just to get the factor you guys are famous for farming so far out to see you don't pollute that's where he said we're so far out the waste of my fish gets distributed not concentrated and then he added are basically a world into ourselves a few conversion ratio two point five to one he said best in the business two point five to one great two point five what what what do you feed sustainable proteins he said great i said got off the phone and that night i was lying in bed and i thought what the hell is a sustainable protein so the next day just before the event i called down i said down what are some examples of sustainable proteins he said even know he would ask around well i got on the phone and a few people in the company no one could give me a straight answer until finally i got on the phone with the head biologist let's call him down to donna said what are some examples of sustainable proteins well we mentioned some algaees and some fish meals and then he said chicken palats as a chicken pox he said yeah feather skin bone meal scraps dried and processed into feat he said what percentage of your feed is chicken thinking two percent what's about thirty percent he said i said don what's sustainable about feeding chicken fish there's a long pause on the line and he said there's just too much chicken in the world i fell out of love with this fish now not because some self righteous goody too shoes foody i actually am and i fell out of love with this fish because i sort of got after that conversation the fish tasted like chicken the second fish what's a different kind of love story it's the romantic kind a kind where the more you get to know your fish you love the fish i first ate at a restaurant in southern spain a journalist friend have been talking about this fish for a long time she kind of set us up ok it came to the table a bright almost simmering light color the chef had overcooked it like twice amazingly it was still delicious who can make a fish taste good after it's been overcooked i can't but this guy can't let's call him mego actually his name is mego and now he didn't cook the fish and he's not a chef at least in the way that you and i understand is a biologist at vetla pama it's a fish farm in the southwestern corner of spain it's at the tip of the guala cavere river until the nineteen eighties the farm was in the hands of the argentinians they raised beef cattle what was essentially wetlands they did it by training land they built this intricate series of canals and they pushed water off the land and out into the river well it couldn't make it work not economically and ecologically it was disaster killed ninety percent of the birds which for this place is a lot of birds and so in nineteen eighty two a spanish company with an environmental conscience purchased the land what did they do they reverse the flow of water they literally flip the switch instead of pushing water out they used the channels to pull water back in they flooded the canous they created a twenty seven thousand acre fish fund up bas mallet shrimp wheel any in the process negal and this company it completely reversed the ecological destruction now the farm is incredible i mean you've never seen anything like this you stare out at a horizon that is a million miles away and all you see are flooded canals and this thick rich marshland i was there not long ago with me and he's an amazing guy like three parts charles darwin and one part crocodile done be ok but here we are slowing through the wetland you know i'm panting and sweating i'm mut up to my knees and he is commly conducting a biology lecture here he's pointing out a rare black shoulder kite now he's mentioning the mineral needs of phytoplankton and here here he sees a grouping pattern that reminds him of the tanzanian giraff it turns out megal spent the better part of his career in the macumi national park in africa i asked him how he became such an expert on fish he said fish i don't know anything about fish i'm an expert in relationships and then he's off launching the more talk about rare birds and algaees and strange aquatic plants and don't get me wrong i was really fascinating you know the biotic community unplugged kind of thing you know it's great but i was in love and my head was sooning over that overcooked piece of delicious fish i had the night before i interacted and i said me now what makes your fish taste so good you point at the algae i know do the algae the phytoplankton the relationships amazing right but what are your fish eating what's the feed conversion ratio what goes on to tell me it's such a rich system that the fish are eating what they meeting in the wild the plant biomass the fight upline the zoo plants it's what feeds the fish the system is so healthy it's totally selfurning there is no feed ever heard of a farm that doesn't feed its animals later that day i was driving around this property with me go and i asked them i said for a place it seems so natural unlike any fish allegate farm i'd ever been at how do you measure success at that moment it's as if a film director called for a set change and we rounded the corner and saw the most amazing site thousands and thousands of pink filming gos a

point five to one great two point five what what what do you feed sustainable proteins he said great i said got off the phone and that night i was lying in bed and i thought what the hell is a sustainable protein so the next day just before the event i called down i said down what are some examples of sustainable proteins he said even know he would ask around well i got on the phone and a few people in the company no one could give me a straight answer until finally i got on the phone with the head biologist let's call him down to donna said what are some examples of sustainable proteins well we mentioned some algaees and some fish meals and then he said chicken palats as a chicken pox he said yeah feather skin bone meal scraps dried and processed into feat he said what percentage of your feed is chicken thinking two percent what's about thirty percent he said i said don what's sustainable about feeding chicken fish there's a long pause on the line and he said there's just too much chicken in the world i fell out of love with this fish now not because some self righteous goody too shoes foody i actually am and i fell out of love with this fish because i sort of got after that conversation the fish tasted like chicken the second fish what's a different kind of love story it's the romantic kind a kind where the more you get to know your fish you love the fish i first ate at a restaurant in southern spain a journalist friend have been talking about this fish for a long time she kind of set us up ok it came to the table a bright almost simmering light color the chef had overcooked it like twice amazingly it was still delicious who can make a fish taste good after it's been overcooked i can't but this guy can't let's call him mego actually his name is mego and now he didn't cook the fish and he's not a chef at least in the way that you and i understand is a biologist at vetla pama it's a fish farm in the southwestern corner of spain it's at the tip of the guala cavere river until the nineteen eighties the farm was in the hands of the argentinians they raised beef cattle what was essentially wetlands they did it by training land they built this intricate series of canals and they pushed water off the land and out into the river well it couldn't make it work not economically and ecologically it was disaster killed ninety percent of the birds which for this place is a lot of birds and so in nineteen eighty two a spanish company with an environmental conscience purchased the land what did they do they reverse the flow of water they literally flip the switch instead of pushing water out they used the channels to pull water back in they flooded the canous they created a twenty seven thousand acre fish fund up bas mallet shrimp wheel any in the process negal and this company it completely reversed the ecological destruction now the farm is incredible i mean you've never seen anything like this you stare out at a horizon that is a million miles away and all you see are flooded canals and this thick rich marshland i was there not long ago with me and he's an amazing guy like three parts charles darwin and one part crocodile done be ok but here we are slowing through the wetland you know i'm panting and sweating i'm mut up to my knees and he is commly conducting a biology lecture here he's pointing out a rare black shoulder kite now he's mentioning the mineral needs of phytoplankton and here here he sees a grouping pattern that reminds him of the tanzanian giraff it turns out megal spent the better part of his career in the macumi national park in africa i asked him how he became such an expert on fish he said fish i don't know anything about fish i'm an expert in relationships and then he's off launching the more talk about rare birds and algaees and strange aquatic plants and don't get me wrong i was really fascinating you know the biotic community unplugged kind of thing you know it's great but i was in love and my head was sooning over that overcooked piece of delicious fish i had the night before i interacted and i said me now what makes your fish taste so good you point at the algae i know do the algae the phytoplankton the relationships amazing right but what are your fish eating what's the feed conversion ratio what goes on to tell me it's such a rich system that the fish are eating what they meeting in the wild the plant biomass the fight upline the zoo plants it's what feeds the fish the system is so healthy it's totally selfurning there is no feed ever heard of a farm that doesn't feed its animals later that day i was driving around this property with me go and i asked them i said for a place it seems so natural unlike any fish allegate farm i'd ever been at how do you measure success at that moment it's as if a film director called for a set change and we rounded the corner and saw the most amazing site thousands and thousands of pink filming gos a literal pink carpet as far as you can see that success he said look at their ballies pink they're fishing feasting i was totally confused i said me aren't they feasting on your fish yes he said we lose twenty percent of our fish and fish eggs to birds last year this property had six hundred thousand birds on it more than two hundred and fifty different species it's become today the largest and one of the most important the private bird sanctuaries in all of europe i said me go isn't a thriving bird population like the last thing you want on a fish farm he should have said no he said that we farm extensively not intensively this is an ecological network the flumingos eat the shrimp the shrimp eat the fightoplankton so the pink of the belly the better the system ok so let's reveal a farm that doesn't feed its animals
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3659054)[0m i'd like to share with you a discovery that i made a few months ago while writing an article for italian wired i always keep my sars handy never i'm

went to look up to two thousand and nine online edition expecting to find a revision worth noting here's the updated version of this entry unfortunately it's not much better i find the last two words

words and how we construct those values our language affects our thinking and how we view the world and how we view other people in fact many ancient societies including the greeks and the romans believed that to utter occurse verbally was so powerful because to say the thing out loud brought it into existence so what reality do we want to call into existence a person who is limited or a person who is empowered by casually doing something a symbol is naming a person a child we might be putting kids and casting shadows on their power wouldn't we want to open doors for them instead one such person who opened doors for me was my child a doctor at the aipant institute in wilmington delaware his name is doctor pizzatelo an italian american whose name apparently was too difficult for most americans to pronounce so he went by doctor p and doctor p always were really colorful booties and had the very perfect disposition to work with children i loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital which the exception of my physical therapy sessions i had to do what seemed like in numerable repetitions of exercises with these thick elastic band different colors you know to help build up my leg muscles and i hated these bands more than anything i hated them had names of them i hated them and you know i was already barging at a five year old child with doctor pe to try to get out of doing these exercises unsuccessfully of course and one day he came in to my session exhaustive and forgiving with these sessions and he said to me wow you are such a strong powerful little girl i think you're going to break one of those bands when you do break it i'm going to give you one hundred bucks now of course this was the simple bloy on doctor pe's part to get me to do the exercise i didn't want to do before the prospect of being the richest five year old in the second floor ward but what he effectively did for me was reshape an awful daily occurrence into a new and promising experience for me and i have to wonder today to what extent his vision and his declaration of me as a strong and powerful little girl shaped my own view of myself as an inherently strong powerful and athletic person well into the future this is an example of how adults and positions of power can ignite the power of a child but in the previous instances of those far century you know our language isn't allowing us to evolve into the reality that we would all want now the possibility of an individual to see themselves is capable our language hasn't caught up with the changes in our society many of which have been brought about by technology certainly for a medical standpoint my legs laser surgery for vision impairment titanium needs and hip replacements for aging bodies that are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities and move beyond the limits that nature imposed on them not to mention social networking platforms allows people to self identify to claim their own descriptions of themselves so they can go alone with global groups of their own choosing so perhaps technology is revealing more clearly to us now what has always been a truth that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest asset the human ability to adapt is an interesting thing because people have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity and i'm going to make an admission this phrase never sat right with me and i always felt an easy trying to answer people's questions about it and i think i'm starting to figure out why implicit in this phrase of overcoming adversity is the idea that success or happiness is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience unscathed or unmarked by the experience as if my successes in life have come about from an ability to side step or circum navigate to presume pitballs of a life with prosthetics or what other people perceive as my disability but in fact we are changed we are marked of course by a challenge whether physically emotionally or both and i'm going to suggest that this is a good thing adversity isn't an obstacle that we need to get around in order to resume living our lives it's part of our life and i tend to think of it like my shadow sometimes i see a lot of it sometimes there's very little but it's always with me and certainly i'm not trying to diminish the impact the weight of a person's struggle there is adversity and challenge in life and it's all very real and relative to every single person but the question isn't whether or not you're going to meet adversity but how you're going to meet it so our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adversity but preparing them to meet it well and we do a service to our kids when we make them feel that they're not equipped to adapt there is an important difference and distinction between the objective medical fact of my being an empathy and the subjective societal opinion of whether or not i'm disabled and truthfully the only real and consistent disability i'd had to confront is the world ever thinking that i could be described by those definitions in our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold hard truth about their medical prognosis or indeed prognosis on the expected quality of their life we have to make sure that we don't put the first brick in a wall that will actually disabled someone perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it it serves to be more disabling to the individual than the pathology itself by not treating the wholeness of a person by not acknowledging their potency we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have we are effectively grading someone's worth to our community so we need to see through the pathology and into the range of human capability and most importantly there's a partnership between those perceived deficiencies and our greatest creative ability so it's not about devaluing or negating these more trying time is something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug but instead to find those opportunities wrapped in the adversity so maybe the idea i want to put out there is not so much overcoming adversity as it is opening ourselves up to it embracing it grappling with it use a restling term maybe even dancing with it
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3659056)[0m i grew up on study diet of sides fiction in high school i took a bus to school an hour each way every day and i was always absorbed in a book science fiction book which took my mind to other worlds and satisfied in a narrative form this insatiable sense of curiosity that i had and you know that curiosity also manifested itself in the fact that whenever i was in school i was out in the woods hiking and taking samples frogs and snakes and bugs and pond water and bringing it back looking at it under the microscope i was you know i was real science peak but it was all about trying to understand understand the world understand the limits of possibility and my love of science fiction actually seemed to be mirred in the world around me because what was happening this was in the late sixties you know we were going to the moon we were exploring the deep oceans jacques cousteau was coming into our living rooms with his amazing specials that showed us animals and places in a wondrous world that we could never really have previously imagined so that seemed to resonate with the whole science fiction part of it and i was an artist i could draw paint and i found that because there weren't video games and this saturation of sg movies and all of this imagery in the media landscape i had to create these images in my head you know we all did as kids having to read a book and through the office description put something on the screen the movie screen in our heads and so my response to this was to paint to draw alien creatures alien worlds robots spaceships all that stuff i was endlessly getting busted in math class you know doodling behind the textbook and that was the creativity had to find its outlet somehow and an interesting thing happened there jack cousteo that shows actually got me very excited about the fact that there was an alien world right here on earth i might not really go to an alien world on a spaceship someday that seemed pretty darn unlikely but that was a world i could really go to right here on earth it was as rich and exotic as anything that i had imagined from reading these books so i decided i was going to become a scuba diver at the age of fifteen and the only problem with that was that i lived in a little village in canada six hundred miles from the nearest ocean but i didn't let that daunt me i pastured my father until he finally found a scuba class in buffalo new york right across the border from where we live then i actually got certified in a pool at a ymca in the dead of winter in buffalo new york and i didn't see the ocean a real ocean for another two years and so we moved to california and now since then in the intervening forty years i've spent about three thousand hours underwater and five hundred hours of that was in submersibles and i've learned that that deep ocean environment and even the shallow oceans are so rich with amazing life that really is beyond beyond our imagination and nature's imagination is so so boundless compared to our own mere human imagination i still to this day stand in absolute awe of what i see when i make these dives and i love afair with the oceans is ongoing and just as strong as it ever was but when i chose career as an adult it was filmmaking and that seemed to be the best way to reconcile this urge i had to tell stories with my urges to create images and i was as a kid constantly drawing comic puts and so on so film making was the way to put pictures and stories together and that made sense and of course the stories that i chose to tell were science fiction stories terminator aliens then the abyss and with the abyss i was putting together my love of underwater and diving with filmmaking so you know merging the two passions something interesting came out of the abyss which was to solve a specific narrative problem on that film which was to create this kind of liquid water creature we actually embraced a computer generated animation sg and this resulted in the first soft surface character seg animation that was ever in him in a movie and even though child been making money bare and broke even i should say i witness something amazing which is that the audience the global audience was mesmerized by this apparent magic you know arthur clark's law and any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable for magic they were seeing something magical and so that got me very excited i thought wow this is something that needs to be embraced into the systematic art so with terminator two which was my next film we took that much further working with ilm we created the liquid metal dude in that film and the success i in the balance on whether that effect would work and it did and we created magic again and we had the same result with an audience although we didn't make a little more money on that way so you know doctory aline through those two two dots of experience came to this is going to be a whole new world this is a whole new world of creativity for for film artists so i started a company with stan winson my good friend stan winson who is the premier makeup and creature designer at that time and it was called digital domain and the concept of the company was that we would leapfrog past the kind of analog processes of optical printers and so on and we would go right to digital production and we actually did that and it gave us a competitive advantage for a while but we found ourselves lagging in the mid nineties in the creature and character design stuff that we had actually founded the company to do so i wrote this piece called avatar which was meant to absolutely push the envelope of visual effects of sg effects beyond with realistic human emotive characters generated in sg and the main characters would all be in sg and the world would be in sg and well you know the emblo pushed back and i was told by folks at my company that we weren't going to be able to do this for a while so i shelved it and i made this other movie about a big ship at six and you know i went in pitch it to the studio as romeo and juliet on a ship it's going to be this epic romance passionate the film secretly what i wanted to do was i wanted to dive to the real reck of titanic and that's why i made the mov and that's the truth now the studio didn't know that but i convinced them i said i said we're going to dive to the reck we're going to film it for real we'll be using it in the opening of the film it will be really important to be a great marketing hook and i talked them into funding an expedition sounds crazy but this goes back to that theme about your imagination creating a reality actually created a reality where six months later i found myself in a russian submersible at two and a half miles down in the north atlantic looking at the real titanic through through a real port not a movie not hd for real now that blew my mind and you know it took a lot of preparation we had to build cameras and lights and all kinds of things but it struck me how much this dive these deep dives like a space mission you know where it was highly technical and required enormous planning and you get in this capsule you go down to this dark hostile environment where there's no hope of rescue if you can't get back by yourself and you know i've thought wow i'm like living in a science fiction movie this is really cool and so i really got bitten by the bug of deep ocean exploration of course the curiosity of the science component of it it was everything it was an adventure it was curiosity it was imagination and it was an experience that hollywood couldn't give me because you know i could imagine a creature and we could create a visual effect for it but i couldn't imagine what i was seeing out that window as we did some of our subsequent expeditions so i was seeing creatures at hydrothermal vents and sometimes things that i had never seen before sometimes things that no one had seen before that actually were not described by science at the time that we saw them and image them so i was completely smitten by this and had to do more and so i actually made a kind of curious decision after the success of titanic i said okay you know i'm going to park my day job as a hollywood movie maker and i'm going to go be a full time explorer for a while and so we started planning these expeditions and we wound up going to the bismark and exploring with robotic vehicles we went back to the titanic rec we took little bots that we had created this spool of fiber optic
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3659049)[0m that's ted right here we have a machine a big machine a cool tedish machine and it's a time machine and everyone in this room's again into it and you can go backwards you can go forwards you cannot stay where you are and i wonder what you'd choose because i've been asking my friends this question a lot lately and they all want to go back i don't know i want to go back before there were automobiles or twitter or american idle i don't know i'm convinced that there's some sort of pull and nostalgia to wishful thinking and i understand that i'm not part of that crowd i have to say but i don't want to go back and it's not because i'm adventurous it's because possibilities on this planet they don't go back they go forward so i want to get in the machine and i want to go forward this is the greatest time there's ever been on this planet by any measure that you wish to choose health wealth but mobility opportunity declining rates of disease there's never been a time like this my great grandparents died all of them by the time they were sixty my grandparents pushed that number to seventy my parents were closing in our navy so they're better be it they're better be a nine in the beginning of my death number but it's not even about people like us because now this is a bigger deal than that a kid born in new delhi today can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world did one hundred years ago think about that it's an incredible fact and why is it true smallpox smallpox killed billions of people on this planet it reshaped the demography of the globe in a way that no more ever has it's gone now it's vanished we've vanquished it both in the rich world diseases that threatened millions of us just a generation ago no longer exists hardly dipheria rebella polio does anyone even know what those things are vaccines modern medicine our ability to feed billions of people those are triumphs of the scientific method into my mind the scientific method trying stuff out seeing if it works changing it when it doesn't is one of the great accomplishments of humanity so that's the good news unfortunately that's all the good news because there's some other problems and they've been mentioned many times and one of them is that despite all the accomplishments a billion people go to bed hungry in this world every day that number is rising and it's rising really rapidly and it's discraceful and not only that we've used our imagination to thoroughly trash this globe potable water arable land rainforests oil gas they're going away and they're going away soon and unless we innovate our way out of this mess we're going away to so the question is can we do that and i think we can i think it's clear that we can make food that will feed billions of people without raping the land that they live on i think we can power this world with energy that doesn't also destroy it i really do believe that and no it ain't wishful thinking but here's the thing that keeps me up at night one of the things that keeps me up at night we've never needed progress in science more than we need it right now never and we've also never been in a position to deploy it properly in the way that we can today we're on the verge of amazing amazing events in many fields and yet i actually think we'd have to go back hundreds three hundred years before the enlightenment to find a time when we battle progress when we thought about these things more vigorously on more fronts than we do now people wrap themselves in their beliefs and they do it so tightly that you can't set them free not even the truth will set them free and listen everyone's entitled to their opinion they're even entitled to their opinion about progress but you know you're not entitled to you're not entitled to your own facts sorry you're not and this took me a while to figure out about a decade ago i wrote a story about vaccines from the new yorker a little story and i was amazed to find opposition opposition to what is after all the most effective public health measure in human history i know what to do so i just did what i do i wrote a story and i moved on and soon after that i wrote a story about genetically engineered food same thing only bigger people were going crazy so i wrote a story about that too and i couldn't understand why people thought this was franking foods why they thought moving molecules around in a specific rather than a half hazard way was trespassing on nature's ground but you know i do what i do i wrote this story i moved on i mean i'm a journalist we type we file we go to dinner it's fun but these stories bothered me and i couldn't figure out why and eventually i did and that's because of those fanatics that were driving me crazy weren't actually fanatics at all they were thoughtful people educated people decent people they were exactly like the people in this room and it just disturbed me so much but then i thought you know let's be honest we're at a point in this world but where we don't have the same relationship to progress that we used to talk about it ambivalently we talk about it in ironic terms with little quotes around it progress ok there are reasons for that and i think we know what those reasons are we've lost faith and institutions in authority and sometimes in science itself and there's no reason we should enough you can just say a few names and people will understand a ternoble bopal the challenger viox weapons of mass destruction hanging chads i mean you know you can choose your list there are questions and problems with the people we used to believe we're always right so be skeptical ask questions demand proof demand evidence don't take anything for granted but here's the thing when you get proof you need to accept the proof and we're not that good at doing that and the reason that i can say that is because we're now in an epidemic of fear like one that i've never seen and hope never to see again about twelve years ago there was a story published a horrible story that linked the epidemic of autism to the misles months and rebella vaccine shot very scary tons of studies were done to see if this was true tons of studies should have been done it's in a serious issue the data came back the data came back from the united states from england from sweden from canada and it was all the same no correlation no connection none at all but doesn't matter it doesn't matter because we believe anecdotes we believe what we see what we think we see what makes us feel real but we don't believe a bunch of documents from a government official giving us data and i do understand that i think we all do but you know what the result of that has been disastrous disasters because here's a fact the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the vaccine rate for musels is going down that is disgraceful and we should be ashamed of ourselves it's horrible what kind of a thing happened that we could do that now i understand it i do understand it because who did anyone have museles here it is one person in this audience ever see someone die of museles it doesn't happen very much it doesn't happen in this country at all but it happened one hundred and sixty thousand times in the world last year that's a lot of death of measles twenty an hour but since it didn't happen here we can put it out of our minds and people like gening the carte can go around preaching messages of fear and illiteracy from platforms like oprah and larry king live and they can do it because they don't make causation and correlation they don't understand that these things seem the same but they're almost never the same and it's something we need to learn and we need to learn it really soon this guy was a hero jonas saw he took one of the worst scourges of mankind away from us no fear no agony polio push gone that guy in the middle not so much his name is paul ask he just developed a roto virus vaxing with a bunch of other people it will save the lives of four hundred five hundred thousand kids in the developing world every year pretty good right what's good except the pog goes around talking about vaccines and says how valuable they are and the people ought to just stop the lining and he actually says it that way so pos a terrorist when paul speaks in a public hearing he can't testify without arm guards he gets called at home because people like to tell them that they remember where his kids go to school and why because paul made a vaccine i don't need to say this but vaccines are essential you take them away disease comes back horrible diseases and that's happening we have muss in this country now and it's getting worse and pretty soon kids are going to die again because it's just a numbers game and they're not just going to die of misels what about polio let's have that why not a college classmate of mine wrote a couple of weeks ago and said you know she thought it was a little stride into one's ever said that before and she wasn't going to vaccinate her kid against polio no way fine why because we don't have polio and you know what we didn't have polio in this country yesterday today i don't know maybe a guy got on a plane in lagos this morning and he's flying to l ax right now he's over ohio

starting to figure out why implicit in this phrase of overcoming adversity is the idea that success or happiness is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience unscathed or unmarked by the experience as if my successes in life have come about from an ability to side step or circum navigate to presume pitballs of a life with prosthetics or what other people perceive as my disability but in fact we are changed we are marked of course by a challenge whether physically emotionally or both and i'm going to suggest that this is a good thing adversity isn't an obstacle that we need to get around in order to resume living our lives it's part of our life and i tend to think of it like my shadow sometimes i see a lot of it sometimes there's very little but it's always with me and certainly i'm not trying to diminish the impact the weight of a person's struggle there is adversity and challenge in life and it's all very real and relative to every single person but the question isn't whether or not you're going to meet adversity but how you're going to meet it so our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adversity but preparing them to meet it well and we do a service to our kids when we make them feel that they're not equipped to adapt there is an important difference and distinction between the objective medical fact of my being an empathy and the subjective societal opinion of whether or not i'm disabled and truthfully the only real and consistent disability i'd had to confront is the world ever thinking that i could be described by those definitions in our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold hard truth about their medical prognosis or indeed prognosis on the expected quality of their life we have to make sure that we don't put the first brick in a wall that will actually disabled someone perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it it serves to be more disabling to the individual than the pathology itself by not treating the wholeness of a person by not acknowledging their potency we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have we are effectively grading someone's worth to our community so we need to see through the pathology and into the range of human capability and most importantly there's a partnership between those perceived deficiencies and our greatest creative ability so it's not about devaluing or negating these more trying time is something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug but instead to find those opportunities wrapped in the adversity so maybe the idea i want to put out there is not so much overcoming adversity as it is opening ourselves up to it embracing it grappling with it use a restling term maybe even dancing with it and perhaps if we see adversity as natural consistent and useful we're less burdened by the presence of it this year we celebrate the two hundred birthday of charles darwin and it was one hundred and fifty years ago when writing about evolution the darwin illustrated i think a truth about the human character to paraphrase it's not the strongest of the species that survives nor is it the most intelligent that survives it is the one that is most adaptable to change
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3659050)[0m so i've known a lot of fish in my life i've loved only too the first one was it was more like a passionate affair it was a beautiful fish a flavorful textured me the best seller on the menu what a fish even better it was farm raised to the supposed highest standards of sustainability so you can feel good about selling it i was in a relationship with this beauty for several months one day the head of the company called and as if i'd speak out an event about the farm sustainability absolutely i said here is a company trying to solve but what's become this unimaginable problem for ashefs how do we keep fish on our menus for the past fifty years we've been fishing the seas like we clear cut forests it's hard to overstate the destruction ninety percent of large fish the ones we love the tunas the hellbits the salmon's swordfish the collapse there's nothing left so for better for worse agriculture fish farming part of our future a lot of arguments against it fish farms pollute most of them do anyway and they're inefficient take tuna a major drawback it's got a feed conversion ratio of fifteen to one that means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish to get you one pound a farm tuna not very sustainable it doesn't taste very good either so here finally it was a company trying to do it right i wanted to support the day before the event i called they had a pr for the company let's call him done donna said just to get the factor you guys are famous for farming so far out to see you don't pollute that's where he said we're so far out the waste of my fish gets distributed not concentrated and then he added are basically a world into ourselves a few conversion ratio two point five to one he said best in the business two point five to one great two point five what what what do you feed sustainable proteins he said great i said got off the phone and that night i was lying in bed and i thought what the hell is a sustainable protein so the next day just before the event i called down i said down what are some examples of sustainable proteins he said even know he would ask around well i got on the phone and a few people in the company no one could give me a straight answer until finally i got on the phone with the head biologist let's call him down to donna said what are some examples of sustainable proteins well we mentioned some algaees and some fish meals and then he said chicken palats as a chicken pox he said yeah feather skin bone meal scraps dried and processed into feat he said what percentage of your feed is chicken thinking two percent what's about thirty percent he said i said don what's sustainable about feeding chicken fish there's a long pause on the line and he said there's just too much chicken in the world i fell out of love with this fish now not because some self righteous goody too shoes foody i actually am and i fell out of love with this fish because i sort of got after that conversation the fish tasted like chicken the second fish what's a different kind of love story it's the romantic kind a kind where the more you get to know your fish you love the fish i first ate at a restaurant in southern spain a journalist friend have been talking about this fish for a long time she kind of set us up ok it came to the table a bright almost simmering light color the chef had overcooked it like twice amazingly it was still delicious who can make a fish taste good after it's been overcooked i can't but this guy can't let's call him mego actually his name is mego and now he didn't cook the fish and he's not a chef at least in the way that you and i understand is a biologist at vetla pama it's a fish farm in the southwestern corner of spain it's at the tip of the guala cavere river until the nineteen eighties the farm was in the hands of the argentinians they raised beef cattle what was essentially wetlands they did it by training land they built this intricate series of canals and they pushed water off the land and out into the river well it couldn't make it work not economically and ecologically it was disaster killed ninety percent of the birds which for this place is a lot of birds and so in nineteen eighty two a spanish company with an environmental conscience purchased the land what did they do they reverse the flow of water they literally flip the switch instead of pushing water out they used the channels to pull water back in they flooded the canous they created a twenty seven thousand acre fish fund up bas mallet shrimp wheel any in the process negal and this company it completely reversed the ecological destruction now the farm is incredible i mean you've never seen anything like this you stare out at a horizon that is a million miles away and all you see are flooded canals and this thick rich marshland i was there not long ago with me and he's an amazing guy like three parts charles darwin and one part crocodile done be ok but here we are slowing through the wetland you know i'm panting and sweating i'm mut up to my knees and he is commly conducting a biology lecture here he's pointing out a rare black shoulder kite now he's mentioning the mineral needs of phytoplankton and here here he sees a grouping pattern that reminds him of the tanzanian giraff it turns out megal spent the better part of his career in the macumi national park in africa i asked him how he became such an expert on fish he said fish i don't know anything about fish i'm an expert in relationships and then he's off launching the more talk about rare birds and algaees and strange aquatic plants and don't get me wrong i was really fascinating you know the biotic community unplugged kind of thing you know it's great but i was in love and my head was sooning over that overcooked piece of delicious fish i had the night before i interacted and i said me now what makes your fish taste so good you point at the algae i know do the algae the phytoplankton the relationships amazing right but what are your fish eating what's the feed conversion ratio what goes on to tell me it's such a rich system that the fish are eating what they meeting in the wild the plant biomass the fight upline the zoo plants it's what feeds the fish the system is so healthy it's totally selfurning there is no feed ever heard of a farm that doesn't feed its animals later that day i was driving around this property with me go and i asked them i said for a place it seems so natural unlike any fish allegate farm i'd ever been at how do you measure success at that moment it's as if a film director called for a set change and we rounded the corner and saw the most amazing site thousands and thousands of pink filming gos a literal pink carpet as far as you can see that success he said look at their ballies pink they're fishing feasting i was totally confused i said me aren't they feasting on your fish yes he said we lose twenty percent of our fish and fish eggs to birds last year this property had six hundred thousand birds on it more than two hundred and fifty different species it's become today the largest and one of the most important the private bird sanctuaries in all of europe i said me go isn't a thriving bird population like the last thing you want on a fish farm he should have said no he said that we farm extensively not intensively this is an ecological network the flumingos eat the shrimp the shrimp eat the fightoplankton so the pink of the belly the better the system ok so let's reveal a farm that doesn't feed its animals in a form that measures its success and the health of its predators a fish farm but also a bird sanctuary oh and by the way those flamingos they shouldn't even be there in the first place they brewed in a town one hundred and fifty miles away where the soil conditions are better for buildings every morning they fly one hundred and fifty miles into the farm and every evening they fly one hundred and fifty miles back they do that because they're able to follow the broken white line of highway a ninety two no kidding now i was imagining a march of the penguins thing so i looked at me go i said let me go do they fly one hundred and fifty miles to the farm
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3659049)[0m that's ted right here we have a machine a big machine a cool tedish machine and it's a time machine and everyone in this room's again into it and you can go backwards you can go forwards you cannot stay where you are and i wonder what you'd choose because i've been asking my friends this question a lot lately and they all want to go back i don't know i want to go back before there were automobiles or twitter or american idle i don't know i'm convinced that there's some sort of pull and nostalgia to wishful thinking and i understand that i'm not part of that crowd i have to say but i don't want to go back and it's not because i'm adventurous it's because possibilities on this planet they don't go back they go forward so i want to get in the machine and i want to go forward this is the greatest time there's ever been on this planet by any measure that you wish to choose health wealth but mobility opportunity declining rates of disease there's never been a time like this my great grandparents died all of them by the time they were sixty my grandparents pushed that number to seventy my parents were closing in our navy so they're better be it they're better be a nine in the beginning of my death number but it's not even about people like us because now this is a bigger deal than that a kid born in new delhi today can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world did one hundred years ago think about that it's an incredible fact and why is it true smallpox smallpox killed billions of people on this planet it reshaped the demography of the globe in a way that no more ever has it's gone now it's vanished we've vanquished it both in the rich world diseases that threatened millions of us just a generation ago no longer exists hardly dipheria rebella polio does anyone even know what those things are vaccines modern medicine our ability to feed billions of people those are triumphs of the scientific method into my mind the scientific method trying stuff out seeing if it works changing it when it doesn't is one of the great accomplishments of humanity so that's the good news unfortunately that's all the good news because there's some other problems and they've been mentioned many times and one of them is that despite all the accomplishments a billion people go to bed hungry in this world every day that number is rising and it's rising really rapidly and it's discraceful and not only that we've used our imagination to thoroughly trash this globe potable water arable land rainforests oil gas they're going away and they're going away soon and unless we innovate our way out of this mess we're going away to so the question is can we do that and i think we can i think it's clear that we can make food that will feed billions of people without raping the land that they live on i think we can power this world with energy that doesn't also destroy it i really do believe that and no it ain't wishful thinking but here's the thing that keeps me up at night one of the things that keeps me up at night we've never needed progress in science more than we need it right now never and we've also never been in a position to deploy it properly in the way that we can today we're on the verge of amazing amazing events in many fields and yet i actually think we'd have to go back hundreds three hundred years before the enlightenment to find a time when we battle progress when we thought about these things more vigorously on more fronts than we do now people wrap themselves in their beliefs and they do it so tightly that you can't set them free not even the truth will set them free and listen everyone's entitled to their opinion they're even entitled to their opinion about progress but you know you're not entitled to you're not entitled to your own facts sorry you're not and this took me a while to figure out about a decade ago i wrote a story about vaccines from the new yorker a little story and i was amazed to find opposition opposition to what is after all the most effective public health measure in human history i know what to do so i just did what i do i wrote a story and i moved on and soon after that i wrote a story about genetically engineered food same thing only bigger people were going crazy so i wrote a story about that too and i couldn't understand why people thought this was franking foods why they thought moving molecules around in a specific rather than a half hazard way was trespassing on nature's ground but you know i do what i do i wrote this story i moved on i mean i'm a journalist we type we file we go to dinner it's fun but these stories bothered me and i couldn't figure out why and eventually i did and that's because of those fanatics that were driving me crazy weren't actually fanatics at all they were thoughtful people educated people decent people they were exactly like the people in this room and it just disturbed me so much but then i thought you know let's be honest we're at a point in this world but where we don't have the same relationship to progress that we used to talk about it ambivalently we talk about it in ironic terms with little quotes around it progress ok there are reasons for that and i think we know what those reasons are we've lost faith and institutions in authority and sometimes in science itself and there's no reason we should enough you can just say a few names and people will understand a ternoble bopal the challenger viox weapons of mass destruction hanging chads i mean you know you can choose your list there are questions and problems with the people we used to believe we're always right so be skeptical ask questions demand proof demand evidence don't take anything for granted but here's the thing when you get proof you need to accept the proof and we're not that good at doing that and the reason that i can say that is because we're now in an epidemic of fear like one that i've never seen and hope never to see again about twelve years ago there was a story published a horrible story that linked the epidemic of autism to the misles months and rebella vaccine shot very scary tons of studies were done to see if this was true tons of studies should have been done it's in a serious issue the data came back the data came back from the united states from england from sweden from canada and it was all the same no correlation no connection none at all but doesn't matter it doesn't matter because we believe anecdotes we believe what we see what we think we see what makes us feel real but we don't believe a bunch of documents from a government official giving us data and i do understand that i think we all do but you know what the result of that has been disastrous disasters because here's a fact the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the vaccine rate for musels is going down that is disgraceful and we should be ashamed of ourselves it's horrible what kind of a thing happened that we could do that now i understand it i do understand it because who did anyone have museles here it is one person in this audience ever see someone die of museles it doesn't happen very much it doesn't happen in this country at all but it happened one hundred and sixty thousand times in the world last year that's a lot of death of measles twenty an hour but since it didn't happen here we can put it out of our minds and people like gening the carte can go around preaching messages of fear and illiteracy from platforms like oprah and larry king live and they can do it because they don't make causation and correlation they don't understand that these things seem the same but they're almost never the same and it's something we need to learn and we need to learn it really soon this guy was a hero jonas saw he took one of the worst scourges of mankind away from us no fear no agony polio push gone that guy in the middle not so much his name is paul ask he just developed a roto virus vaxing with a bunch of other people it will save the lives of four hundred five hundred thousand kids in the developing world every year pretty good right what's good except the pog goes around talking about vaccines and says how valuable they are and the people ought to just stop the lining and he actually says it that way so pos a terrorist when paul speaks in a public hearing he can't testify without arm guards he gets called at home because people like to tell them that they remember where his kids go to school and why because paul made a vaccine i don't need to say this but vaccines are essential you take them away disease comes back horrible diseases and that's happening we have muss in this country now and it's getting worse and pretty soon kids are going to die again because it's just a numbers game and they're not just going to die of misels what about polio let's have that why not a college classmate of mine wrote a couple of weeks ago and said you know she thought it was a little stride into one's ever said that before and she wasn't going to vaccinate her kid against polio no way fine why because we don't have polio and you know what we didn't have polio in this country yesterday today i don't know maybe a guy got on a plane in lagos this morning and he's flying to l ax right now he's over ohio and he's going to land in a couple hours he's going to run a car and he's going to come to long beach and he's going to tend one of these fabulous ted dinners tonight and he doesn't know that he's infected with a paralytic disease and we know either because that's the way the world works that's the planet we live on

we have to make sure that we don't put the first brick in a wall that will actually disabled someone perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it it serves to be more disabling to the individual than the pathology itself by not treating the wholeness of a person by not acknowledging their potency we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have we are effectively grading someone's worth to our community so we need to see through the pathology and into the range of human capability and most importantly there's a partnership between those perceived deficiencies and our greatest creative ability so it's not about devaluing or negating these more trying time is something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug but instead to find those opportunities wrapped in the adversity so maybe the idea i want to put out there is not so much overcoming adversity as it is opening ourselves up to it embracing it grappling with it use a restling term maybe even dancing with it and perhaps if we see adversity as natural consistent and useful we're less burdened by the presence of it this year we celebrate the two hundred birthday of charles darwin and it was one hundred and fifty years ago when writing about evolution the darwin illustrated i think a truth about the human character to paraphrase it's not the strongest of the species that survives nor is it the most intelligent that survives it is the one that is most adaptable to change conflict is the genesis of creation from darwin's work amongst others we can recognize that the human ability to survive and flourish is driven by the struggle of the human spirit through conflict into transformation so again transformation adaptation is our greatest
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3659049)[0m that's ted right here we have a machine a big machine a cool tedish machine and it's a time machine and everyone in this room's again into it and you can go backwards you can go forwards you cannot stay where you are and i wonder what you'd choose because i've been asking my friends this question a lot lately and they all want to go back i don't know i want to go back before there were automobiles or twitter or american idle i don't know i'm convinced that there's some sort of pull and nostalgia to wishful thinking and i understand that i'm not part of that crowd i have to say but i don't want to go back and it's not because i'm adventurous it's because possibilities on this planet they don't go back they go forward so i want to get in the machine and i want to go forward this is the greatest time there's ever been on this planet by any measure that you wish to choose health wealth but mobility opportunity declining rates of disease there's never been a time like this my great grandparents died all of them by the time they were sixty my grandparents pushed that number to seventy my parents were closing in our navy so they're better be it they're better be a nine in the beginning of my death number but it's not even about people like us because now this is a bigger deal than that a kid born in new delhi today can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world did one hundred years ago think about that it's an incredible fact and why is it true smallpox smallpox killed billions of people on this planet it reshaped the demography of the globe in a way that no more ever has it's gone now it's vanished we've vanquished it both in the rich world diseases that threatened millions of us just a generation ago no longer exists hardly dipheria rebella polio does anyone even know what those things are vaccines modern medicine our ability to feed billions of people those are triumphs of the scientific method into my mind the scientific method trying stuff out seeing if it works changing it when it doesn't is one of the great accomplishments of humanity so that's the good news unfortunately that's all the good news because there's some other problems and they've been mentioned many times and one of them is that despite all the accomplishments a billion people go to bed hungry in this world every day that number is rising and it's rising really rapidly and it's discraceful and not only that we've used our imagination to thoroughly trash this globe potable water arable land rainforests oil gas they're going away and they're going away soon and unless we innovate our way out of this mess we're going away to so the question is can we do that and i think we can i think it's clear that we can make food that will feed billions of people without raping the land that they live on i think we can power this world with energy that doesn't also destroy it i really do believe that and no it ain't wishful thinking but here's the thing that keeps me up at night one of the things that keeps me up at night we've never needed progress in science more than we need it right now never and we've also never been in a position to deploy it properly in the way that we can today we're on the verge of amazing amazing events in many fields and yet i actually think we'd have to go back hundreds three hundred years before the enlightenment to find a time when we battle progress when we thought about these things more vigorously on more fronts than we do now people wrap themselves in their beliefs and they do it so tightly that you can't set them free not even the truth will set them free and listen everyone's entitled to their opinion they're even entitled to their opinion about progress but you know you're not entitled to you're not entitled to your own facts sorry you're not and this took me a while to figure out about a decade ago i wrote a story about vaccines from the new yorker a little story and i was amazed to find opposition opposition to what is after all the most effective public health measure in human history i know what to do so i just did what i do i wrote a story and i moved on and soon after that i wrote a story about genetically engineered food same thing only bigger people were going crazy so i wrote a story about that too and i couldn't understand why people thought this was franking foods why they thought moving molecules around in a specific rather than a half hazard way was trespassing on nature's ground but you know i do what i do i wrote this story i moved on i mean i'm a journalist we type we file we go to dinner it's fun but these stories bothered me and i couldn't figure out why and eventually i did and that's because of those fanatics that were driving me crazy weren't actually fanatics at all they were thoughtful people educated people decent people they were exactly like the people in this room and it just disturbed me so much but then i thought you know let's be honest we're at a point in this world but where we don't have the same relationship to progress that we used to talk about it ambivalently we talk about it in ironic terms with little quotes around it progress ok there are reasons for that and i think we know what those reasons are we've lost faith and institutions in authority and sometimes in science itself and there's no reason we should enough you can just say a few names and people will understand a ternoble bopal the challenger viox weapons of mass destruction hanging chads i mean you know you can choose your list there are questions and problems with the people we used to believe we're always right so be skeptical ask questions demand proof demand evidence don't take anything for granted but here's the thing when you get proof you need to accept the proof and we're not that good at doing that and the reason that i can say that is because we're now in an epidemic of fear like one that i've never seen and hope never to see again about twelve years ago there was a story published a horrible story that linked the epidemic of autism to the misles months and rebella vaccine shot very scary tons of studies were done to see if this was true tons of studies should have been done it's in a serious issue the data came back the data came back from the united states from england from sweden from canada and it was all the same no correlation no connection none at all but doesn't matter it doesn't matter because we believe anecdotes we believe what we see what we think we see what makes us feel real but we don't believe a bunch of documents from a government official giving us data and i do understand that i think we all do but you know what the result of that has been disastrous disasters because here's a fact the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the vaccine rate for musels is going down that is disgraceful and we should be ashamed of ourselves it's horrible what kind of a thing happened that we could do that now i understand it i do understand it because who did anyone have museles here it is one person in this audience ever see someone die of museles it doesn't happen very much it doesn't happen in this country at all but it happened one hundred and sixty thousand times in the world last year that's a lot of death of measles twenty an hour but since it didn't happen here we can put it out of our minds and people like gening the carte can go around preaching messages of fear and illiteracy from platforms like oprah and larry king live and they can do it because they don't make causation and correlation they don't understand that these things seem the same but they're almost never the same and it's something we need to learn and we need to learn it really soon this guy was a hero jonas saw he took one of the worst scourges of mankind away from us no fear no agony polio push gone that guy in the middle not so much his name is paul ask he just developed a roto virus vaxing with a bunch of other people it will save the lives of four hundred five hundred thousand kids in the developing world every year pretty good right what's good except the pog goes around talking about vaccines and says how valuable they are and the people ought to just stop the lining and he actually says it that way so pos a terrorist when paul speaks in a public hearing he can't testify without arm guards he gets called at home because people like to tell them that they remember where his kids go to school and why because paul made a vaccine i don't need to say this but vaccines are essential you take them away disease comes back horrible diseases and that's happening we have muss in this country now and it's getting worse and pretty soon kids are going to die again because it's just a numbers game and they're not just going to die of misels what about polio let's have that why not a college classmate of mine wrote a couple of weeks ago and said you know she thought it was a little stride into one's ever said that before and she wasn't going to vaccinate her kid against polio no way fine why because we don't have polio and you know what we didn't have polio in this country yesterday today i don't know maybe a guy got on a plane in lagos this morning and he's flying to l ax right now he's over ohio and he's going to land in a couple hours he's going to run a car and he's going to come to long beach and he's going to tend one of these fabulous ted dinners tonight and he doesn't know that he's infected with a paralytic disease and we know either because that's the way the world works that's the planet we live on don't pretend it isn't now we love to wrap ourselves in lives we love to do it everyone take their vitulins this morning
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3659050)[0m so i've known a lot of fish in my life i've loved only too the first one was it was more like a passionate affair it was a beautiful fish a flavorful textured me the best seller on the menu what a fish even better it was farm raised to the supposed highest standards of sustainability so you can feel good about selling it i was in a relationship with this beauty for several months one day the head of the company called and as if i'd speak out an event about the farm sustainability absolutely i said here is a company trying to solve but what's become this unimaginable problem for ashefs how do we keep fish on our menus for the past fifty years we've been fishing the seas like we clear cut forests it's hard to overstate the destruction ninety percent of large fish the ones we love the tunas the hellbits the salmon's swordfish the collapse there's nothing left so for better for worse agriculture fish farming part of our future a lot of arguments against it fish farms pollute most of them do anyway and they're inefficient take tuna a major drawback it's got a feed conversion ratio of fifteen to one that means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish to get you one pound a farm tuna not very sustainable it doesn't taste very good either so here finally it was a company trying to do it right i wanted to support the day before the event i called they had a pr for the company let's call him done donna said just to get the factor you guys are famous for farming so far out to see you don't pollute that's where he said we're so far out the waste of my fish gets distributed not concentrated and then he added are basically a world into ourselves a few conversion ratio two point five to one he said best in the business two point five to one great two point five what what what do you feed sustainable proteins he said great i said got off the phone and that night i was lying in bed and i thought what the hell is a sustainable protein so the next day just before the event i called down i said down what are some examples of sustainable proteins he said even know he would ask around well i got on the phone and a few people in the company no one could give me a straight answer until finally i got on the phone with the head biologist let's call him down to donna said what are some examples of sustainable proteins well we mentioned some algaees and some fish meals and then he said chicken palats as a chicken pox he said yeah feather skin bone meal scraps dried and processed into feat he said what percentage of your feed is chicken thinking two percent what's about thirty percent he said i said don what's sustainable about feeding chicken fish there's a long pause on the line and he said there's just too much chicken in the world i fell out of love with this fish now not because some self righteous goody too shoes foody i actually am and i fell out of love with this fish because i sort of got after that conversation the fish tasted like chicken the second fish what's a different kind of love story it's the romantic kind a kind where the more you get to know your fish you love the fish i first ate at a restaurant in southern spain a journalist friend have been talking about this fish for a long time she kind of set us up ok it came to the table a bright almost simmering light color the chef had overcooked it like twice amazingly it was still delicious who can make a fish taste good after it's been overcooked i can't but this guy can't let's call him mego actually his name is mego and now he didn't cook the fish and he's not a chef at least in the way that you and i understand is a biologist at vetla pama it's a fish farm in the southwestern corner of spain it's at the tip of the guala cavere river until the nineteen eighties the farm was in the hands of the argentinians they raised beef cattle what was essentially wetlands they did it by training land they built this intricate series of canals and they pushed water off the land and out into the river well it couldn't make it work not economically and ecologically it was disaster killed ninety percent of the birds which for this place is a lot of birds and so in nineteen eighty two a spanish company with an environmental conscience purchased the land what did they do they reverse the flow of water they literally flip the switch instead of pushing water out they used the channels to pull water back in they flooded the canous they created a twenty seven thousand acre fish fund up bas mallet shrimp wheel any in the process negal and this company it completely reversed the ecological destruction now the farm is incredible i mean you've never seen anything like this you stare out at a horizon that is a million miles away and all you see are flooded canals and this thick rich marshland i was there not long ago with me and he's an amazing guy like three parts charles darwin and one part crocodile done be ok but here we are slowing through the wetland you know i'm panting and sweating i'm mut up to my knees and he is commly conducting a biology lecture here he's pointing out a rare black shoulder kite now he's mentioning the mineral needs of phytoplankton and here here he sees a grouping pattern that reminds him of the tanzanian giraff it turns out megal spent the better part of his career in the macumi national park in africa i asked him how he became such an expert on fish he said fish i don't know anything about fish i'm an expert in relationships and then he's off launching the more talk about rare birds and algaees and strange aquatic plants and don't get me wrong i was really fascinating you know the biotic community unplugged kind of thing you know it's great but i was in love and my head was sooning over that overcooked piece of delicious fish i had the night before i interacted and i said me now what makes your fish taste so good you point at the algae i know do the algae the phytoplankton the relationships amazing right but what are your fish eating what's the feed conversion ratio what goes on to tell me it's such a rich system that the fish are eating what they meeting in the wild the plant biomass the fight upline the zoo plants it's what feeds the fish the system is so healthy it's totally selfurning there is no feed ever heard of a farm that doesn't feed its animals later that day i was driving around this property with me go and i asked them i said for a place it seems so natural unlike any fish allegate farm i'd ever been at how do you measure success at that moment it's as if a film director called for a set change and we rounded the corner and saw the most amazing site thousands and thousands of pink filming gos a literal pink carpet as far as you can see that success he said look at their ballies pink they're fishing feasting i was totally confused i said me aren't they feasting on your fish yes he said we lose twenty percent of our fish and fish eggs to birds last year this property had six hundred thousand birds on it more than two hundred and fifty different species it's become today the largest and one of the most important the private bird sanctuaries in all of europe i said me go isn't a thriving bird population like the last thing you want on a fish farm he should have said no he said that we farm extensively not intensively this is an ecological network the flumingos eat the shrimp the shrimp eat the fightoplankton so the pink of the belly the better the system ok so let's reveal a farm that doesn't feed its animals in a form that measures its success and the health of its predators a fish farm but also a bird sanctuary oh and by the way those flamingos they shouldn't even be there in the first place they brewed in a town one hundred and fifty miles away where the soil conditions are better for buildings every morning they fly one hundred and fifty miles into the farm and every evening they fly one hundred and fifty miles back they do that because they're able to follow the broken white line of highway a ninety two no kidding now i was imagining a march of the penguins thing so i looked at me go i said let me go do they fly one hundred and fifty miles to the farm and then do they fly one hundred and fifty miles back at night do they do that for the children he looked at me like i just quoted a whitney used and song he said no they do it because the food's better you know i didn't mention the skin of my beloved fish
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3659045)[0m i'm game i'm a game designer in making games online now for ten years and my goal for the next decade is to try to make it as easy to save the world in real life as it is to save the world in online games now i have a plan for this and it entails convincing more people including all of you to spend more time playing bigger and better games right now we spend three billion hours a week playing online games some of you might be thinking that's a lot of time to spend playing games maybe too much time considering how many urgent problems we have to solve in the real world but actually according to my research at the institute for the future it's actually the opposite is true three billion hours a week is not nearly enough game play to solve the world's most urgent problems in fact i believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet we need to increase that total dramatically i've calculated the total we need at twenty one billion hours of game play every week so that's probably a bit of a counterintuitive idea so i'll just say it again let it sync in and if we want to solve problems like hunger poverty climate change global conflict obesity with i believe that we need to aspire to play games online for at least twenty one billion hours a week by the end of the next decade now i'm serious i am here's why this picture pretty much sums up why i think games are so essential to the future survival of the human species truly this is a portrait by a photographer named phil told dono he wanted to capture the emotion of gaming so we set up a camera in front of gamers while they were playing and this is a classic gaming emotion now if you're not a gamer you might miss some of the nuance in this photo you probably see the sense of urgency a little bit of but fear but intense concentration deep deep focus on tackling a really difficult problem if you are a gamer you will notice a few nuances here the crinkle of the eyes up and around the mouth is the sign of optimism and the highbrls up is surprised this is a gamer who's on the verge of something called an epic wind no well you heard of that okay good so we have some gamers among us so an epic win is an outcome that is so extraordinarily positive you had no idea it was even possible until you achieved it it was almost beyond the threshold of imagination and when you get there you're shocked to discover what you're truly capable of that's an epic win this is a gamer on the verge of an ethic win and this is the face that we need to see on millions of problem solvers all over the world as we try to tackle the obstacles of the next century the face of someone who against all odds is on the verge of an epic win now unfortunately this is more of the face that we see in everyday life now as we try to tackle urgent problems this is what i call the i'm not good at life face and this is actually me making it can you see it yes good this is actually me making the i'm not good at life face this is a piece of graffiti in my old neighborhood in berkeley california where i did my phd on why we're better in games than we are in real life and this is a problem that a lot of gamers have we feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games and i don't mean just good as in successful although it's part of it we do achieve more in game worlds but i also mean good as in motivated to do something that matters inspired to collaborate and to cooperate when we're in game worlds i believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves the most likely to help at a moment notice the most likely to stick with a problem as long as it takes to get up after failure and try again and in real life when we face failure when we confront obstacles we often don't feel that way we feel overcome we feel overwhelmed we feel anxious may be depressed frustrated or cynical we never have this feelings from we're playing games they just don't exist in games so that's what i wanted to study when i was a graduate student what about games makes it impossible to feel that we can't achieve everything how can we take those feelings from games and apply them to real world work so i looked at games like world of warcraft which is really the ideal collaborative problem solving environment and i started to notice a few things that make epequins so possible in allline worlds so the first thing is whenever you show up in one of these allline games especially in world of worecraft there are lots and lots of different characters who are willing to trust you with a world saving mission right away but not just any mission it's a mission that is perfectly matched with your current level in the game right so you can do it they never give you a challenge that you can't achieve but it is on the verge of what you're capable of so you have to try hard but there's no unemployment in world of warcraft there's no sitting around bringing your hands there is always something specific and important to be done and there are also tons of collaborators everywhere you go hundreds of thousands of people ready to work with you to achieve your epic mission that's not something we have in real life that easily the sense that at our fingertips are tons of collaborators and also this epic story this inspiring story of why were there and what we're doing and then we get all this positive feedback you guys have heard of leveling up and plus one strength plus ones intelligence we don't get the kind of constant feedback in real life when i get off the stage i'm not going to have plus one speaking and plus one crazy idea plus twenty crazy idea i don't get that feedback in real life now the problem with collaborative online environments like world of warcraft is that it's so satisfying to be on the verge of an epic one all the time that we decide to spend all our time in these game worlds it's just better than reality so so far collectively all the road of warcraft gamers have spent five point nine three million years solving the virtual problems of asora now that's not necessarily a bad thing it might sound like it's a bad thing but to put that in context five point nine three million years ago was when our earliest primate human ancestors stood up that was the first upright primate ok so when we talk about how much time we're currently investing in playing games the only way it makes sense to even think about it is to talk about time at the magnitude of human evolution which is an extraordinary thing but it's also act because it turns out that by spending all this time playing games we're actually changing what we are capable of as human beings we're evolving to be more collaborative and hardy species this is true i believe this so consider this really interesting statistic i was recently published by a researcher at carnegie mellon university the average young person today in a country with a strong gamer culture will have spent ten thousand hours playing online games by the age of twenty one now ten thousand hours is a really interesting number for two reasons first of all for children in the united states ten thousand and eighty hours is the exact amount of time you will spend in school from fifth grade to high school graduation if you have perfect attendance we have an entire parallel track of education going on where young people are learning as much about what it takes to be a good gamer as they're learning about everything else in school but some of you have probably read malcolm gladwell's new book outliers so you would have heard of his theory of success the ten thousand hour theory of success it's based on this great cognitive science research that if we can master ten thousand hours of effortful study at anything by the age of twenty one we will be virtuoso that it will be as good at whatever we do as the greatest people in the world and so now what we're looking at is an entire generation of young people who are virtuoso gamers so the big question is what exactly our gamer is getting so good at because if we could figure that out we would have a virtually unprecedented human resource on our hands this is how many people we have in the world who spend at least an hour a day playing online games these are virtuoso gamers five hundred million people who are extraordinarily good at something and in the next decade we're going to have another billion gamers who are extraordinarily good at whatever that is if you don't know it already this is coming the game industry is developing consols that are low energy and that work with the wireless phone networks instead of broadband internet so that gamers all over the world particularly in india that china brazil can get online they expect one billion more gamers in the next decade so it brings up to one point five billion gamers so i started to think about what these games are making us virtuous as a here are the four things i came up with the first is urgent optimism okay think of this as extreme self motivation urgent optimism is the desire to act immediately to tackle an obstacle combined with the belief that we have a reasonable hope of success but gamers always believe that an epic one is possible i mean it is always worth trying and trying now game results around gamers are virtuosos at weaving a tight social fabric there's a lot of interesting research that shows that we like people better after we play a game with them even if they beaten us badly the reason is it takes a lot of trust to play a game with someone we trust that they will spend their time with us that they will play by the same rules value the same goal they'll stay with the game until it's over and so playing a game together actually builds up bonds and trust and cooperation and we actually build stronger social relationships as a result blissful productivity i love it you know there's a reason why the average world of warcraft gamer plays for twenty two hours a week kind of a half time job it's because we know when we're playing a game that we're actually happier working hard than we are but relaxing or hanging out we know that we are optimized as human beings to do hard meaningful work and gamers are willing to work hard all the time if they're given the right work finally epic meaning

farm that doesn't feed its animals later that day i was driving around this property with me go and i asked them i said for a place it seems so natural unlike any fish allegate farm i'd ever been at how do you measure success at that moment it's as if a film director called for a set change and we rounded the corner and saw the most amazing site thousands and thousands of pink filming gos a literal pink carpet as far as you can see that success he said look at their ballies pink they're fishing feasting i was totally confused i said me aren't they feasting on your fish yes he said we lose twenty percent of our fish and fish eggs to birds last year this property had six hundred thousand birds on it more than two hundred and fifty different species it's become today the largest and one of the most important the private bird sanctuaries in all of europe i said me go isn't a thriving bird population like the last thing you want on a fish farm he should have said no he said that we farm extensively not intensively this is an ecological network the flumingos eat the shrimp the shrimp eat the fightoplankton so the pink of the belly the better the system ok so let's reveal a farm that doesn't feed its animals in a form that measures its success and the health of its predators a fish farm but also a bird sanctuary oh and by the way those flamingos they shouldn't even be there in the first place they brewed in a town one hundred and fifty miles away where the soil conditions are better for buildings every morning they fly one hundred and fifty miles into the farm and every evening they fly one hundred and fifty miles back they do that because they're able to follow the broken white line of highway a ninety two no kidding now i was imagining a march of the penguins thing so i looked at me go i said let me go do they fly one hundred and fifty miles to the farm and then do they fly one hundred and fifty miles back at night do they do that for the children he looked at me like i just quoted a whitney used and song he said no they do it because the food's better you know i didn't mention the skin of my beloved fish which was delicious and i don't like fish skin i don't like it seared i don't like it crispy as that accurate tar like flavor i almost never cop with it yet when i tasted it at that restaurant in southern spain it tasted not it all like fiskin it tasted sweet and clean like you were taking a bit of the ocean i mentioned that to me and he nodded he said the skin acts like a fuge it's the last defense before anything enters the body it evolved up to soake up in purities and then he added but our water has no impurities ok a farm that doesn't feed its fish a farm that measures the success by the success of its predators and then i realized what he says a farm that has no impurities he made a big understatement because the water that flows through that farm comes in from the gudulk of your river it's a river that carries with it all the things that rivers tend to carry these days chemical contaminants pesticide runoff and when it works its way through the system and leaves the water it's cleaner than when it enter the system is so healthy it purifies the water
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3659036)[0m i'm going to talk today about energy and climate and that might seem a bit surprising because my full time work of the foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds about the things that we need to invent and deliver to help the poorest two billion live better lives but energy and climate are extremely important to these people in fact more important than to anyone else on the planet the climate getting worse means that many years their crops won't grow there'll be too much rain not enough rain things will change in ways that their fragile environment simply can't support and that leads to starvation it leads to uncertainty it leads to unrest so that the climate changes will be terrible for them also the price of energy is very important to them in fact if you could pick just one thing the lower the price up to reduce poverty by far you would pick energy now the price of energy has come down over time really advanced civilization is based on advances in energy the coal revolution fueled the industrial revolution in the nineteen hundreds we've seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity and that's why we have refrigerators air conditioning we can make modern materials and do so many things and so we're in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world but as we make it cheaper and let's say let's go for making it twice as cheap we need to meet a new constraint and that constraint has to do with co two co two is warming the planet and the equation on co two is actually a very straightforward one if you sum up the co two that gets submitted that leads to a temperature increase and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects the effects on the weather perhaps worse the indirect effects in the natural ecosystems can't adjust to these rapid changes and so you get ecosystem collapses now the exact amount of how you map from a certain increase of co two to what temperature will be and where the positive feedbacks are there's some uncertainty there but not very much and there's certainly uncertainty about how bad those effects will be but they will be extremely bad i asked the top scientists and the several times do we really have to get down to near zero can't we just cut it in half a quarter and the answer is that until we get near to zero the temperature will continue to rise and so that's a big challenge it's very different than saying you know we're a twelve foot high truck trying to get under a ten foot bridge and we can just sort of squeeze under this is something that has to get to zero now we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year over twenty six billion tons for each american it's about twenty tons for people in poor countries it's less than one ton it's an average about five tons for everyone on the planet and somehow we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero it's been constantly going up it's only various economic changes that have even flattened at all so we have to go from rapidly rising to falling and falling all the way to zero this equation has four factors a little bit of multiplication so you've got a thing on the left co two that you want to get to zero and that's going to be based on the number of people the services each person juicy on average the energy on average for each service and the co two being put out a per unit of energy so let's look at each one of these and see how we can get this out into zero probably one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero that's back from high school algebra let's take a look first we've got population the world today has six point eight billion people that's headed up to about nine billion now if we do a really great job on new vaccines healthcare reproductive health services we could lower that by perhaps ten or fifteen percent but there we see an increase of about one point three the second factor is the services we use this encompasses everything the food we clothing tv heating these are very good things getting rid of poverty means providing these services to almost everyone on the planet and it's a great thing for this number to go up in the rich world perhaps the top one billion we probably could cut back and use less but every year this number on average is going to go up and so overall that will more than double the services delivered per person here we have a very basic service do you have lighting in your house to be able to read your homework and then in fact these kids don't so they're going out and reading their schoolwork under the street laps and now efficiency the energy for each service here finally we have some good news we have something that's not going up through various inventions and new ways of doing lighting through different types of cars different ways of building buildings there are a lot of services where you can bring the energy for that service down quite substantially some individual services even bring it down by ninety percent there are other services like how we make fertilizes or how we do our transport where the rooms for improvement are far far less and so overall here if we're optimistic we may get a reduction of a factor of three to even perhaps a factor of sex but for these first three factors now we've gone from twenty six billion to its best maybe thirteen billion tons and that just won't cut it so let's look at this fourth factor there's going to be a key one and this is the amount of co two put out for each unit of energy and so the question is can you actually get that to zero if you burn coal no if you burn natural gas almost every way we make electricity today except for the emerging renewables and nuclear puts out co two and so what we're going to have to do at a global scale is create a new system and so we need energy miracles now when i use the term miracle i don't mean something that's impossible the microprocessors a miracle the personal computers a miracle the internet and services are a miracle so the people here have participated in the creation of many miracles usually we don't have a deadline where you have to get the miracle by a certain date usually just kind of stand by and some come along some don't this is a case where we actually have to drive a full speed and get a miracle in a pretty tight timeline now i thought how could i really capture this is there's some kind of natural illustration some demonstration that would grab people's imagination here i thought back to a year ago when i brought mosquitoes and somehow people enjoyed that it really got them involved in the idea of you know there are people who lived in mosquitoes so with energy i like to come up with is this i decided that releasing fireflies would be my contribution to the environment here this year so here we have some natural fly flies i'm told they don't bite in fact they might even not even leave that jar now there's all sorts of geeky solutions like that one but they don't really add up too much we need solutions either one or several that have unbelievable scale and unbelievable reliability and although there's many directions of people seeking i really only see five that can achieve the big numbers i've left out time geothermal fusion biopules those may make some contribution and if they can do better than i expect so much the better but my key point here is that we're going to have to work on each of these five and we can't give up any of them because they look daunting because they all that have significant challenges let's look first at the burning fossil fuels either burning coal or burning natural gas what you need to do there it seems like it might be simple but it's not and that's to take all the co two after you burn it going out the flu pressurize it create a liquid put it somewhere and hope it stays there now we have some pilot things that do this at the sixty to eighty percent level but getting up to that full percentage that will be very tricky and a green on where these co two quantity should be put will be hard but the toughest one here is this long term issue who's going to be sure who's going to guarantee something that is literally billions of times larger than any type of waste you think of in terms of nuclear other things this is a lot of volume so that's the top one next would be nuclear it also has three big problems cost particularly in highly regulated countries is high the issue of the safety really feeling good about nothing can go wrong that even though you have these human operators that the fuel it doesn't get used for weapons and then what do you do with the waste although it's not very large there are a lot of concerns about that people need to feel good about it so three very tough problems that might be solvable and so should be worked on the last three of the five i've grouped together these are what people often refer to as the renewable sources and they actually although it's great they don't require fuel they have some disadvantages one is that the density of energy gather in these technologies is dramatically less than a power plant this is energy farming so you're talking about many square miles thousands of times more area than you think of as a normal energy plant also these are interment and sources the sun doesn't shine all day it doesn't shine every day and likewise the wind doesn't blow all the time and so you depend on these sources you have to have some way of getting energy during those time periods that it's not available so we've got big cost challenges here we have transmission challenges for example say this energy sources outside your country you not only need the technology but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from elsewhere and finally this storage problem and dimensionalized this i went through and looked at all the types of batteries that get made for cars for computers for phones for flashlights for everything and compared that to the amount of electrical energy the world uses and what i found is that all the batteries we make now could store less than ten minutes of all the energy and so in fact we need a big breakthrough here something that's going to be a factor of one hundred better than the approaches we have now it's not impossible but it's not a very easy thing now this shows up when you try to get the internet source to be above say twenty to thirty percent of what you're using if you're counting on it for one hundred percent you need an incredible miracle battery now how we're going to go forward on this what's the right approach is that a banhattan project what's the thing that can get us there well we need lots of companies working on this hundreds in each of these five paths we need at least one hundred people and a lot of them you look at and say they're crazy that's good and i think here in the ted group we have many people who are already pursuing this
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3659049)[0m that's ted right here we have a machine a big machine a cool tedish machine and it's a time machine and everyone in this room's again into it and you can go backwards you can go forwards you cannot stay where you are and i wonder what you'd choose because i've been asking my friends this question a lot lately and they all want to go back i don't know i want to go back before there were automobiles or twitter or american idle i don't know i'm convinced that there's some sort of pull and nostalgia to wishful thinking and i understand that i'm not part of that crowd i have to say but i don't want to go back and it's not because i'm adventurous it's because possibilities on this planet they don't go back they go forward so i want to get in the machine and i want to go forward this is the greatest time there's ever been on this planet by any measure that you wish to choose health wealth but mobility opportunity declining rates of disease there's never been a time like this my great grandparents died all of them by the time they were sixty my grandparents pushed that number to seventy my parents were closing in our navy so they're better be it they're better be a nine in the beginning of my death number but it's not even about people like us because now this is a bigger deal than that a kid born in new delhi today can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world did one hundred years ago think about that it's an incredible fact and why is it true smallpox smallpox killed billions of people on this planet it reshaped the demography of the globe in a way that no more ever has it's gone now it's vanished we've vanquished it both in the rich world diseases that threatened millions of us just a generation ago no longer exists hardly dipheria rebella polio does anyone even know what those things are vaccines modern medicine our ability to feed billions of people those are triumphs of the scientific method into my mind the scientific method trying stuff out seeing if it works changing it when it doesn't is one of the great accomplishments of humanity so that's the good news unfortunately that's all the good news because there's some other problems and they've been mentioned many times and one of them is that despite all the accomplishments a billion people go to bed hungry in this world every day that number is rising and it's rising really rapidly and it's discraceful and not only that we've used our imagination to thoroughly trash this globe potable water arable land rainforests oil gas they're going away and they're going away soon and unless we innovate our way out of this mess we're going away to so the question is can we do that and i think we can i think it's clear that we can make food that will feed billions of people without raping the land that they live on i think we can power this world with energy that doesn't also destroy it i really do believe that and no it ain't wishful thinking but here's the thing that keeps me up at night one of the things that keeps me up at night we've never needed progress in science more than we need it right now never and we've also never been in a position to deploy it properly in the way that we can today we're on the verge of amazing amazing events in many fields and yet i actually think we'd have to go back hundreds three hundred years before the enlightenment to find a time when we battle progress when we thought about these things more vigorously on more fronts than we do now people wrap themselves in their beliefs and they do it so tightly that you can't set them free not even the truth will set them free and listen everyone's entitled to their opinion they're even entitled to their opinion about progress but you know you're not entitled to you're not entitled to your own facts sorry you're not and this took me a while to figure out about a decade ago i wrote a story about vaccines from the new yorker a little story and i was amazed to find opposition opposition to what is after all the most effective public health measure in human history i know what to do so i just did what i do i wrote a story and i moved on and soon after that i wrote a story about genetically engineered food same thing only bigger people were going crazy so i wrote a story about that too and i couldn't understand why people thought this was franking foods why they thought moving molecules around in a specific rather than a half hazard way was trespassing on nature's ground but you know i do what i do i wrote this story i moved on i mean i'm a journalist we type we file we go to dinner it's fun but these stories bothered me and i couldn't figure out why and eventually i did and that's because of those fanatics that were driving me crazy weren't actually fanatics at all they were thoughtful people educated people decent people they were exactly like the people in this room and it just disturbed me so much but then i thought you know let's be honest we're at a point in this world but where we don't have the same relationship to progress that we used to talk about it ambivalently we talk about it in ironic terms with little quotes around it progress ok there are reasons for that and i think we know what those reasons are we've lost faith and institutions in authority and sometimes in science itself and there's no reason we should enough you can just say a few names and people will understand a ternoble bopal the challenger viox weapons of mass destruction hanging chads i mean you know you can choose your list there are questions and problems with the people we used to believe we're always right so be skeptical ask questions demand proof demand evidence don't take anything for granted but here's the thing when you get proof you need to accept the proof and we're not that good at doing that and the reason that i can say that is because we're now in an epidemic of fear like one that i've never seen and hope never to see again about twelve years ago there was a story published a horrible story that linked the epidemic of autism to the misles months and rebella vaccine shot very scary tons of studies were done to see if this was true tons of studies should have been done it's in a serious issue the data came back the data came back from the united states from england from sweden from canada and it was all the same no correlation no connection none at all but doesn't matter it doesn't matter because we believe anecdotes we believe what we see what we think we see what makes us feel real but we don't believe a bunch of documents from a government official giving us data and i do understand that i think we all do but you know what the result of that has been disastrous disasters because here's a fact the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the vaccine rate for musels is going down that is disgraceful and we should be ashamed of ourselves it's horrible what kind of a thing happened that we could do that now i understand it i do understand it because who did anyone have museles here it is one person in this audience ever see someone die of museles it doesn't happen very much it doesn't happen in this country at all but it happened one hundred and sixty thousand times in the world last year that's a lot of death of measles twenty an hour but since it didn't happen here we can put it out of our minds and people like gening the carte can go around preaching messages of fear and illiteracy from platforms like oprah and larry king live and they can do it because they don't make causation and correlation they don't understand that these things seem the same but they're almost never the same and it's something we need to learn and we need to learn it really soon this guy was a hero jonas saw he took one of the worst scourges of mankind away from us no fear no agony polio push gone that guy in the middle not so much his name is paul ask he just developed a roto virus vaxing with a bunch of other people it will save the lives of four hundred five hundred thousand kids in the developing world every year pretty good right what's good except the pog goes around talking about vaccines and says how valuable they are and the people ought to just stop the lining and he actually says it that way so pos a terrorist when paul speaks in a public hearing he can't testify without arm guards he gets called at home because people like to tell them that they remember where his kids go to school and why because paul made a vaccine i don't need to say this but vaccines are essential you take them away disease comes back horrible diseases and that's happening we have muss in this country now and it's getting worse and pretty soon kids are going to die again because it's just a numbers game and they're not just going to die of misels what about polio let's have that why not a college classmate of mine wrote a couple of weeks ago and said you know she thought it was a little stride into one's ever said that before and she wasn't going to vaccinate her kid against polio no way fine why because we don't have polio and you know what we didn't have polio in this country yesterday today i don't know maybe a guy got on a plane in lagos this morning and he's flying to l ax right now he's over ohio and he's going to land in a couple hours he's going to run a car and he's going to come to long beach and he's going to tend one of these fabulous ted dinners tonight and he doesn't know that he's infected with a paralytic disease and we know either because that's the way the world works that's the planet we live on don't pretend it isn't now we love to wrap ourselves in lives we love to do it everyone take their vitulins this morning a little any accident to get you going i know you did because half of americans do every day they take the stuff and they take alternative medicines and it doesn't matter how often we find out that they're useless the data says it all the time they darken your ear and they almost never do more than that it took you want to pay twenty eight billion dollars for dark r and i'm totally with you dark urine dark why do we do that why do we do that well i think i understand we hate big farmer we hate big government we don't trust the man and we should it our healthcare

go backwards you can go forwards you cannot stay where you are and i wonder what you'd choose because i've been asking my friends this question a lot lately and they all want to go back i don't know i want to go back before there were automobiles or twitter or american idle i don't know i'm convinced that there's some sort of pull and nostalgia to wishful thinking and i understand that i'm not part of that crowd i have to say but i don't want to go back and it's not because i'm adventurous it's because possibilities on this planet they don't go back they go forward so i want to get in the machine and i want to go forward this is the greatest time there's ever been on this planet by any measure that you wish to choose health wealth but mobility opportunity declining rates of disease there's never been a time like this my great grandparents died all of them by the time they were sixty my grandparents pushed that number to seventy my parents were closing in our navy so they're better be it they're better be a nine in the beginning of my death number but it's not even about people like us because now this is a bigger deal than that a kid born in new delhi today can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world did one hundred years ago think about that it's an incredible fact and why is it true smallpox smallpox killed billions of people on this planet it reshaped the demography of the globe in a way that no more ever has it's gone now it's vanished we've vanquished it both in the rich world diseases that threatened millions of us just a generation ago no longer exists hardly dipheria rebella polio does anyone even know what those things are vaccines modern medicine our ability to feed billions of people those are triumphs of the scientific method into my mind the scientific method trying stuff out seeing if it works changing it when it doesn't is one of the great accomplishments of humanity so that's the good news unfortunately that's all the good news because there's some other problems and they've been mentioned many times and one of them is that despite all the accomplishments a billion people go to bed hungry in this world every day that number is rising and it's rising really rapidly and it's discraceful and not only that we've used our imagination to thoroughly trash this globe potable water arable land rainforests oil gas they're going away and they're going away soon and unless we innovate our way out of this mess we're going away to so the question is can we do that and i think we can i think it's clear that we can make food that will feed billions of people without raping the land that they live on i think we can power this world with energy that doesn't also destroy it i really do believe that and no it ain't wishful thinking but here's the thing that keeps me up at night one of the things that keeps me up at night we've never needed progress in science more than we need it right now never and we've also never been in a position to deploy it properly in the way that we can today we're on the verge of amazing amazing events in many fields and yet i actually think we'd have to go back hundreds three hundred years before the enlightenment to find a time when we battle progress when we thought about these things more vigorously on more fronts than we do now people wrap themselves in their beliefs and they do it so tightly that you can't set them free not even the truth will set them free and listen everyone's entitled to their opinion they're even entitled to their opinion about progress but you know you're not entitled to you're not entitled to your own facts sorry you're not and this took me a while to figure out about a decade ago i wrote a story about vaccines from the new yorker a little story and i was amazed to find opposition opposition to what is after all the most effective public health measure in human history i know what to do so i just did what i do i wrote a story and i moved on and soon after that i wrote a story about genetically engineered food same thing only bigger people were going crazy so i wrote a story about that too and i couldn't understand why people thought this was franking foods why they thought moving molecules around in a specific rather than a half hazard way was trespassing on nature's ground but you know i do what i do i wrote this story i moved on i mean i'm a journalist we type we file we go to dinner it's fun but these stories bothered me and i couldn't figure out why and eventually i did and that's because of those fanatics that were driving me crazy weren't actually fanatics at all they were thoughtful people educated people decent people they were exactly like the people in this room and it just disturbed me so much but then i thought you know let's be honest we're at a point in this world but where we don't have the same relationship to progress that we used to talk about it ambivalently we talk about it in ironic terms with little quotes around it progress ok there are reasons for that and i think we know what those reasons are we've lost faith and institutions in authority and sometimes in science itself and there's no reason we should enough you can just say a few names and people will understand a ternoble bopal the challenger viox weapons of mass destruction hanging chads i mean you know you can choose your list there are questions and problems with the people we used to believe we're always right so be skeptical ask questions demand proof demand evidence don't take anything for granted but here's the thing when you get proof you need to accept the proof and we're not that good at doing that and the reason that i can say that is because we're now in an epidemic of fear like one that i've never seen and hope never to see again about twelve years ago there was a story published a horrible story that linked the epidemic of autism to the misles months and rebella vaccine shot very scary tons of studies were done to see if this was true tons of studies should have been done it's in a serious issue the data came back the data came back from the united states from england from sweden from canada and it was all the same no correlation no connection none at all but doesn't matter it doesn't matter because we believe anecdotes we believe what we see what we think we see what makes us feel real but we don't believe a bunch of documents from a government official giving us data and i do understand that i think we all do but you know what the result of that has been disastrous disasters because here's a fact the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the vaccine rate for musels is going down that is disgraceful and we should be ashamed of ourselves it's horrible what kind of a thing happened that we could do that now i understand it i do understand it because who did anyone have museles here it is one person in this audience ever see someone die of museles it doesn't happen very much it doesn't happen in this country at all but it happened one hundred and sixty thousand times in the world last year that's a lot of death of measles twenty an hour but since it didn't happen here we can put it out of our minds and people like gening the carte can go around preaching messages of fear and illiteracy from platforms like oprah and larry king live and they can do it because they don't make causation and correlation they don't understand that these things seem the same but they're almost never the same and it's something we need to learn and we need to learn it really soon this guy was a hero jonas saw he took one of the worst scourges of mankind away from us no fear no agony polio push gone that guy in the middle not so much his name is paul ask he just developed a roto virus vaxing with a bunch of other people it will save the lives of four hundred five hundred thousand kids in the developing world every year pretty good right what's good except the pog goes around talking about vaccines and says how valuable they are and the people ought to just stop the lining and he actually says it that way so pos a terrorist when paul speaks in a public hearing he can't testify without arm guards he gets called at home because people like to tell them that they remember where his kids go to school and why because paul made a vaccine i don't need to say this but vaccines are essential you take them away disease comes back horrible diseases and that's happening we have muss in this country now and it's getting worse and pretty soon kids are going to die again because it's just a numbers game and they're not just going to die of misels what about polio let's have that why not a college classmate of mine wrote a couple of weeks ago and said you know she thought it was a little stride into one's ever said that before and she wasn't going to vaccinate her kid against polio no way fine why because we don't have polio and you know what we didn't have polio in this country yesterday today i don't know maybe a guy got on a plane in lagos this morning and he's flying to l ax right now he's over ohio and he's going to land in a couple hours he's going to run a car and he's going to come to long beach and he's going to tend one of these fabulous ted dinners tonight and he doesn't know that he's infected with a paralytic disease and we know either because that's the way the world works that's the planet we live on don't pretend it isn't now we love to wrap ourselves in lives we love to do it everyone take their vitulins this morning a little any accident to get you going i know you did because half of americans do every day they take the stuff and they take alternative medicines and it doesn't matter how often we find out that they're useless the data says it all the time they darken your ear and they almost never do more than that it took you want to pay twenty eight billion dollars for dark r and i'm totally with you dark urine dark why do we do that why do we do that well i think i understand we hate big farmer we hate big government we don't trust the man and we should it our healthcare system sucks it's cruel to millions of people it's absolutely astonishing cold and sole dending to those of us who can even afford it so we run away from it and where do we run we leap into the arms of big placebo that's fantastic i love big but it's really a serious thing because this stuff is crap and we spend billions of dollars on it and i have all sorts of little crops here none of the geek frog a canadia frog a car i don't even know what that is but we're spending billions of dollars on it it's frog and you know what when i say this stuff people scream at me and they said wouldn't care but people do what they want to do it makes them feel good and you know what you're wrong because i don't care if it's the secretary of ts
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3659038)[0m everybody talks about happiness these days i had somebody count the number of books with happiness in the title published in the last five years and they gave up after about forty and there were many more and there is a huge wave of interest in happiness among researchers there is a lot of happiness culturing everybody would like to make people happier but in spread of all this flood of work there are several cognitive traps that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight about happiness and my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive traps this applies to lay people thinking about their own happiness and it applies to scholars thinking about happiness because it turns out we're just as messed up as anybody else's the first of these traps are reluctance to admit complexity it turns out that the word happiness is just not a useful word anymore because we applied to too many different things i think there is one particular meaningful to which we might restrict it but by and large this is something that we'll have to give up and we'll have to adopt a more complicated view of what well being is the second trap is a confusion between experience and memory basically it's between being happy in your life and being happy about your life so happy with your life and those are two very different concepts and they're both lumped in the notion of happiness and the third is it's the focusing illusion and it's the unfortunate fact that we can't think about any circumstance that affects will be without distorting it's important i mean this is a real cognitive prop there's just no way of getting it right now i'd like to start with an example of somebody with a question an answer session after one of my lectures and reported a story and that was a story he said he had been listening to a symphony and it was absolutely glorious music and at the very end of the recording there was a dreadful screeching sound and then he added really quite emotionally and it drew in the whole experience but it happened when it had ruined with the memory of the experience he had had the experience he had had twenty minutes of glorious music they counted for nothing because he was left with the memory the memory was ruined and the memory was all that he had gotten keep what this is telling us really is that we might be thinking of ourselves and other people in terms of two cells there is an experiencing self who lives in the present and knows the present it's capable of re living the past but basically it has only the present it's the experiencing self that the doctor approaches you know when the doctor does it hurt now when i thought you hear and then there is a remembering self and the remembering self is the one that keeps score and maintains the story of our life and it's the one that the doctor approaches in asking the question how have you been feeling lately how is your trip torbania or something like that those are two very different entities the experiencing self and the remembering self and getting confused between them is part of the mess about the notion of happiness now the remembering self is a storyteller and that really starts with a basic a response of our memory it starts immediately we don't only tell stories when we set out to tell stories our memory tells our stories that is what we get to keep from our experiences is a story and let me begin with one example this is an old study those are actual patients undergoing a painful procedure i won't go into detail it's no longer painful these days but it was painful when they when the study was run in the nineteen nineties there is a report on their pain every sixty seconds and here are two patients those are their recordings and you are ask who of them suffered more and it's a very easy question i mean clearly patient be suffered more it's clonoscopy was longer and every a minute of pain that patient a had patient b had and more but now there's another question how much did these patients think they suffer and here is a surprise and the surprise is that patient a had a much worse memory of the clonoscopy the patient b the stories of the clonoscopies were different and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends and neither these stories is very inspiring or great but one of them is distinct but one of them is distinctly worse than the other and the one that is worse is the one where pain was that it speaks at the very end it's a bad story how do we know that because we asked these people after their colonoscopy and much later too how bad was the whole thing in total and it was much worse for aid than for me in memory now this is a direct conflict between the experiencing self and the remembering self from the point of view the experiencing self clearly be at a worst time now what you could do with patient aid and we actually ran clinical experiments and it has been done and it does work you could actually extend the monoscopy of patient aid by just keeping the tubin without driggling it too much that will that will cause the patient to suffer but just a little and much less than before and if you do that for a couple of minutes you have made the experiencing self of patient a will sof and you've made the remembering self of patient a lot better off because now you have a doubt patient a with a better story about his experience what defines a story and that is true of the stories that memory delivers for us and it's also true of the stories that we make up what finds a story changes significant moments and endings endings are very very important and in this case you know the ending dominated now the experiencing self lives its life continuously has moments of experience one after the other and you can ask what happens to these moments and the answer is really straightforward they are lost forever i mean most of the moments of our life when i calculated you know the psychological present is said to be about three seconds long that means that you know in a life there are about six hundred million of them in a month there are about six hundred thousand but most of them don't leave the trace most of them are completely ignored by the remembering self and yet somehow you get the sense that they should count that what happens during these moments of experience is our life it's the finite resource that we are spending where we are on the earth and how to spend it would seem to be relevant but that is not the story that our remembering self keeps for us so we have remembering self and the experiencing self and they're really quite distinct the biggest difference between them is in the handing of time from the point of view of the experiencing self if you have a vacation and the second week is just as good as the first then the two week vacation is twice as good as the one week vacation that's not the way it works at all for the remembering self for the remembering self the two week vacation is barely better than the one week vacation because there are no new memories added you have not changed the story and in this way time is actually the critical variable that distinguishes a remembering self from our experiencing self time has very little impact on the story now the remembering self does more than remember and tell stories it is actually the one that makes decisions because if you have a patient who has had say two clonoscopes with two different surgeons and is deciding which for them to choose then but the one that chooses the one that has the memory that is less bad and that's the surgery that would be chosen and the experiencing self has no voice in this choice we actually don't choose between experiences we choose between memories of experiences and even when we think about the future we don't think of our future normally as experiences we think of our future as anticipated memories and basically you can look at the tyrony of the remembering self and you can think of the remembering self sort of dragging the experiencing self through experiences that the experiencing self doesn't mean i have that sense that when we go on locations this is very frequently the case that is that it's we go on vacations to a very large extent in the service of our remembering self and this is a bit how to justify a thing i mean how much do we consume our memories that is one of the explanations that has given for the dominance of the remembering self and when i think about that i think about a vocation we had an antctic a few years ago which was clearly the vestification of the heart and i think of it ratibly often relative to how much i think of other vacations and i'd probably have consumed my memories of that three week trip i would say for about twenty five minutes in the last four years now you know if i had ever opened the folder with the six hundred pictures in it i would have spent another hour now that is three weeks and that is that most an hour and a half there seems to be a discrepancy now i may be a bit extreme in how little appetite i have for consuming memories but even if you do more of those there is a genuine question why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences so i want you to think about a thought experiment imagine that for your next vacation you know that at the end of the vacation all your pictures will be destroyed and you'll get an amusic bug so that you won't remember anything now would you choose the same vacation if you would choose a different vacation there is a conflict between your two cells and you need to think about how to dunicate the conflict and it's actually not at all obvious because if you think in terms of time then you get one answer and if you think in terms of memories you might get another answer why do we pick them the locations we do is a problem that confronts us you know with a choice between the two cells now the two cells bring up two notions of happiness there are really two concepts of happiness that we can apply one per self and so you can ask how happy as the experiencing self and then you would ask how happy are the moments in the experiencing self life and there are happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process what are the emotions that can be measured and by the way now we are capable of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experiencing self over time if you ask for the happiness of the remembering self it's a completely different thing this is not about how happy a person lives it is about how satisfied or please the person is when that person thinks about her life very different notions anyone who doesn't distinguish those notions is going to miss up the study of happiness and i belong to a crowd of students a well being
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3659050)[0m so i've known a lot of fish in my life i've loved only too the first one was it was more like a passionate affair it was a beautiful fish a flavorful textured me the best seller on the menu what a fish even better it was farm raised to the supposed highest standards of sustainability so you can feel good about selling it i was in a relationship with this beauty for several months one day the head of the company called and as if i'd speak out an event about the farm sustainability absolutely i said here is a company trying to solve but what's become this unimaginable problem for ashefs how do we keep fish on our menus for the past fifty years we've been fishing the seas like we clear cut forests it's hard to overstate the destruction ninety percent of large fish the ones we love the tunas the hellbits the salmon's swordfish the collapse there's nothing left so for better for worse agriculture fish farming part of our future a lot of arguments against it fish farms pollute most of them do anyway and they're inefficient take tuna a major drawback it's got a feed conversion ratio of fifteen to one that means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish to get you one pound a farm tuna not very sustainable it doesn't taste very good either so here finally it was a company trying to do it right i wanted to support the day before the event i called they had a pr for the company let's call him done donna said just to get the factor you guys are famous for farming so far out to see you don't pollute that's where he said we're so far out the waste of my fish gets distributed not concentrated and then he added are basically a world into ourselves a few conversion ratio two point five to one he said best in the business two point five to one great two point five what what what do you feed sustainable proteins he said great i said got off the phone and that night i was lying in bed and i thought what the hell is a sustainable protein so the next day just before the event i called down i said down what are some examples of sustainable proteins he said even know he would ask around well i got on the phone and a few people in the company no one could give me a straight answer until finally i got on the phone with the head biologist let's call him down to donna said what are some examples of sustainable proteins well we mentioned some algaees and some fish meals and then he said chicken palats as a chicken pox he said yeah feather skin bone meal scraps dried and processed into feat he said what percentage of your feed is chicken thinking two percent what's about thirty percent he said i said don what's sustainable about feeding chicken fish there's a long pause on the line and he said there's just too much chicken in the world i fell out of love with this fish now not because some self righteous goody too shoes foody i actually am and i fell out of love with this fish because i sort of got after that conversation the fish tasted like chicken the second fish what's a different kind of love story it's the romantic kind a kind where the more you get to know your fish you love the fish i first ate at a restaurant in southern spain a journalist friend have been talking about this fish for a long time she kind of set us up ok it came to the table a bright almost simmering light color the chef had overcooked it like twice amazingly it was still delicious who can make a fish taste good after it's been overcooked i can't but this guy can't let's call him mego actually his name is mego and now he didn't cook the fish and he's not a chef at least in the way that you and i understand is a biologist at vetla pama it's a fish farm in the southwestern corner of spain it's at the tip of the guala cavere river until the nineteen eighties the farm was in the hands of the argentinians they raised beef cattle what was essentially wetlands they did it by training land they built this intricate series of canals and they pushed water off the land and out into the river well it couldn't make it work not economically and ecologically it was disaster killed ninety percent of the birds which for this place is a lot of birds and so in nineteen eighty two a spanish company with an environmental conscience purchased the land what did they do they reverse the flow of water they literally flip the switch instead of pushing water out they used the channels to pull water back in they flooded the canous they created a twenty seven thousand acre fish fund up bas mallet shrimp wheel any in the process negal and this company it completely reversed the ecological destruction now the farm is incredible i mean you've never seen anything like this you stare out at a horizon that is a million miles away and all you see are flooded canals and this thick rich marshland i was there not long ago with me and he's an amazing guy like three parts charles darwin and one part crocodile done be ok but here we are slowing through the wetland you know i'm panting and sweating i'm mut up to my knees and he is commly conducting a biology lecture here he's pointing out a rare black shoulder kite now he's mentioning the mineral needs of phytoplankton and here here he sees a grouping pattern that reminds him of the tanzanian giraff it turns out megal spent the better part of his career in the macumi national park in africa i asked him how he became such an expert on fish he said fish i don't know anything about fish i'm an expert in relationships and then he's off launching the more talk about rare birds and algaees and strange aquatic plants and don't get me wrong i was really fascinating you know the biotic community unplugged kind of thing you know it's great but i was in love and my head was sooning over that overcooked piece of delicious fish i had the night before i interacted and i said me now what makes your fish taste so good you point at the algae i know do the algae the phytoplankton the relationships amazing right but what are your fish eating what's the feed conversion ratio what goes on to tell me it's such a rich system that the fish are eating what they meeting in the wild the plant biomass the fight upline the zoo plants it's what feeds the fish the system is so healthy it's totally selfurning there is no feed ever heard of a farm that doesn't feed its animals later that day i was driving around this property with me go and i asked them i said for a place it seems so natural unlike any fish allegate farm i'd ever been at how do you measure success at that moment it's as if a film director called for a set change and we rounded the corner and saw the most amazing site thousands and thousands of pink filming gos a literal pink carpet as far as you can see that success he said look at their ballies pink they're fishing feasting i was totally confused i said me aren't they feasting on your fish yes he said we lose twenty percent of our fish and fish eggs to birds last year this property had six hundred thousand birds on it more than two hundred and fifty different species it's become today the largest and one of the most important the private bird sanctuaries in all of europe i said me go isn't a thriving bird population like the last thing you want on a fish farm he should have said no he said that we farm extensively not intensively this is an ecological network the flumingos eat the shrimp the shrimp eat the fightoplankton so the pink of the belly the better the system ok so let's reveal a farm that doesn't feed its animals in a form that measures its success and the health of its predators a fish farm but also a bird sanctuary oh and by the way those flamingos they shouldn't even be there in the first place they brewed in a town one hundred and fifty miles away where the soil conditions are better for buildings every morning they fly one hundred and fifty miles into the farm and every evening they fly one hundred and fifty miles back they do that because they're able to follow the broken white line of highway a ninety two no kidding now i was imagining a march of the penguins thing so i looked at me go i said let me go do they fly one hundred and fifty miles to the farm and then do they fly one hundred and fifty miles back at night do they do that for the children he looked at me like i just quoted a whitney used and song he said no they do it because the food's better you know i didn't mention the skin of my beloved fish which was delicious and i don't like fish skin i don't like it seared i don't like it crispy as that accurate tar like flavor i almost never cop with it yet when i tasted it at that restaurant in southern spain it tasted not it all like fiskin it tasted sweet and clean like you were taking a bit of the ocean i mentioned that to me and he nodded he said the skin acts like a fuge it's the last defense before anything enters the body it evolved up to soake up in purities and then he added but our water has no impurities ok a farm that doesn't feed its fish a farm that measures the success by the success of its predators and then i realized what he says a farm that has no impurities he made a big understatement because the water that flows through that farm comes in from the gudulk of your river it's a river that carries with it all the things that rivers tend to carry these days chemical contaminants pesticide runoff and when it works its way through the system and leaves the water it's cleaner than when it enter the system is so healthy it purifies the water so not just a farm that doesn't feed its animals not just a farm that measures the health it's successed by the health of its predators but a farm that's literally a water perification plant and not just for those fish but for you and me as well because when that water leaves it dumps out into the atlantic a drop in the ocean i know but i'll take it and so should you because this love story however romantic is also instructive you might say it's a recipe for the future of good food whether we're talking about bass or beef cattle what we need now is a radically new conception of agriculture one in which the food actually tastes good but for a lot of people that's a bit too radical we're not real as us foods we're lumbers we love farmers markets we love small family farms we talk about local food we organic and when you suggest these are the things that will ensure the future of good food someone somewhere stands up and says hey yeah now i love pink flaming us now how you go and feed the world how are you going to feed the world can i be honest i don't love that question no not because we already produce enough calories to more than feed the world one billion people

asked these people after their colonoscopy and much later too how bad was the whole thing in total and it was much worse for aid than for me in memory now this is a direct conflict between the experiencing self and the remembering self from the point of view the experiencing self clearly be at a worst time now what you could do with patient aid and we actually ran clinical experiments and it has been done and it does work you could actually extend the monoscopy of patient aid by just keeping the tubin without driggling it too much that will that will cause the patient to suffer but just a little and much less than before and if you do that for a couple of minutes you have made the experiencing self of patient a will sof and you've made the remembering self of patient a lot better off because now you have a doubt patient a with a better story about his experience what defines a story and that is true of the stories that memory delivers for us and it's also true of the stories that we make up what finds a story changes significant moments and endings endings are very very important and in this case you know the ending dominated now the experiencing self lives its life continuously has moments of experience one after the other and you can ask what happens to these moments and the answer is really straightforward they are lost forever i mean most of the moments of our life when i calculated you know the psychological present is said to be about three seconds long that means that you know in a life there are about six hundred million of them in a month there are about six hundred thousand but most of them don't leave the trace most of them are completely ignored by the remembering self and yet somehow you get the sense that they should count that what happens during these moments of experience is our life it's the finite resource that we are spending where we are on the earth and how to spend it would seem to be relevant but that is not the story that our remembering self keeps for us so we have remembering self and the experiencing self and they're really quite distinct the biggest difference between them is in the handing of time from the point of view of the experiencing self if you have a vacation and the second week is just as good as the first then the two week vacation is twice as good as the one week vacation that's not the way it works at all for the remembering self for the remembering self the two week vacation is barely better than the one week vacation because there are no new memories added you have not changed the story and in this way time is actually the critical variable that distinguishes a remembering self from our experiencing self time has very little impact on the story now the remembering self does more than remember and tell stories it is actually the one that makes decisions because if you have a patient who has had say two clonoscopes with two different surgeons and is deciding which for them to choose then but the one that chooses the one that has the memory that is less bad and that's the surgery that would be chosen and the experiencing self has no voice in this choice we actually don't choose between experiences we choose between memories of experiences and even when we think about the future we don't think of our future normally as experiences we think of our future as anticipated memories and basically you can look at the tyrony of the remembering self and you can think of the remembering self sort of dragging the experiencing self through experiences that the experiencing self doesn't mean i have that sense that when we go on locations this is very frequently the case that is that it's we go on vacations to a very large extent in the service of our remembering self and this is a bit how to justify a thing i mean how much do we consume our memories that is one of the explanations that has given for the dominance of the remembering self and when i think about that i think about a vocation we had an antctic a few years ago which was clearly the vestification of the heart and i think of it ratibly often relative to how much i think of other vacations and i'd probably have consumed my memories of that three week trip i would say for about twenty five minutes in the last four years now you know if i had ever opened the folder with the six hundred pictures in it i would have spent another hour now that is three weeks and that is that most an hour and a half there seems to be a discrepancy now i may be a bit extreme in how little appetite i have for consuming memories but even if you do more of those there is a genuine question why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences so i want you to think about a thought experiment imagine that for your next vacation you know that at the end of the vacation all your pictures will be destroyed and you'll get an amusic bug so that you won't remember anything now would you choose the same vacation if you would choose a different vacation there is a conflict between your two cells and you need to think about how to dunicate the conflict and it's actually not at all obvious because if you think in terms of time then you get one answer and if you think in terms of memories you might get another answer why do we pick them the locations we do is a problem that confronts us you know with a choice between the two cells now the two cells bring up two notions of happiness there are really two concepts of happiness that we can apply one per self and so you can ask how happy as the experiencing self and then you would ask how happy are the moments in the experiencing self life and there are happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process what are the emotions that can be measured and by the way now we are capable of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experiencing self over time if you ask for the happiness of the remembering self it's a completely different thing this is not about how happy a person lives it is about how satisfied or please the person is when that person thinks about her life very different notions anyone who doesn't distinguish those notions is going to miss up the study of happiness and i belong to a crowd of students a well being who've been missing up the study of happiness for a long time in precisely this way the distinction between the happiness of the experiencing self and the satisfaction of the remembering self has been recognized in recent years
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3659036)[0m i'm going to talk today about energy and climate and that might seem a bit surprising because my full time work of the foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds about the things that we need to invent and deliver to help the poorest two billion live better lives but energy and climate are extremely important to these people in fact more important than to anyone else on the planet the climate getting worse means that many years their crops won't grow there'll be too much rain not enough rain things will change in ways that their fragile environment simply can't support and that leads to starvation it leads to uncertainty it leads to unrest so that the climate changes will be terrible for them also the price of energy is very important to them in fact if you could pick just one thing the lower the price up to reduce poverty by far you would pick energy now the price of energy has come down over time really advanced civilization is based on advances in energy the coal revolution fueled the industrial revolution in the nineteen hundreds we've seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity and that's why we have refrigerators air conditioning we can make modern materials and do so many things and so we're in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world but as we make it cheaper and let's say let's go for making it twice as cheap we need to meet a new constraint and that constraint has to do with co two co two is warming the planet and the equation on co two is actually a very straightforward one if you sum up the co two that gets submitted that leads to a temperature increase and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects the effects on the weather perhaps worse the indirect effects in the natural ecosystems can't adjust to these rapid changes and so you get ecosystem collapses now the exact amount of how you map from a certain increase of co two to what temperature will be and where the positive feedbacks are there's some uncertainty there but not very much and there's certainly uncertainty about how bad those effects will be but they will be extremely bad i asked the top scientists and the several times do we really have to get down to near zero can't we just cut it in half a quarter and the answer is that until we get near to zero the temperature will continue to rise and so that's a big challenge it's very different than saying you know we're a twelve foot high truck trying to get under a ten foot bridge and we can just sort of squeeze under this is something that has to get to zero now we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year over twenty six billion tons for each american it's about twenty tons for people in poor countries it's less than one ton it's an average about five tons for everyone on the planet and somehow we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero it's been constantly going up it's only various economic changes that have even flattened at all so we have to go from rapidly rising to falling and falling all the way to zero this equation has four factors a little bit of multiplication so you've got a thing on the left co two that you want to get to zero and that's going to be based on the number of people the services each person juicy on average the energy on average for each service and the co two being put out a per unit of energy so let's look at each one of these and see how we can get this out into zero probably one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero that's back from high school algebra let's take a look first we've got population the world today has six point eight billion people that's headed up to about nine billion now if we do a really great job on new vaccines healthcare reproductive health services we could lower that by perhaps ten or fifteen percent but there we see an increase of about one point three the second factor is the services we use this encompasses everything the food we clothing tv heating these are very good things getting rid of poverty means providing these services to almost everyone on the planet and it's a great thing for this number to go up in the rich world perhaps the top one billion we probably could cut back and use less but every year this number on average is going to go up and so overall that will more than double the services delivered per person here we have a very basic service do you have lighting in your house to be able to read your homework and then in fact these kids don't so they're going out and reading their schoolwork under the street laps and now efficiency the energy for each service here finally we have some good news we have something that's not going up through various inventions and new ways of doing lighting through different types of cars different ways of building buildings there are a lot of services where you can bring the energy for that service down quite substantially some individual services even bring it down by ninety percent there are other services like how we make fertilizes or how we do our transport where the rooms for improvement are far far less and so overall here if we're optimistic we may get a reduction of a factor of three to even perhaps a factor of sex but for these first three factors now we've gone from twenty six billion to its best maybe thirteen billion tons and that just won't cut it so let's look at this fourth factor there's going to be a key one and this is the amount of co two put out for each unit of energy and so the question is can you actually get that to zero if you burn coal no if you burn natural gas almost every way we make electricity today except for the emerging renewables and nuclear puts out co two and so what we're going to have to do at a global scale is create a new system and so we need energy miracles now when i use the term miracle i don't mean something that's impossible the microprocessors a miracle the personal computers a miracle the internet and services are a miracle so the people here have participated in the creation of many miracles usually we don't have a deadline where you have to get the miracle by a certain date usually just kind of stand by and some come along some don't this is a case where we actually have to drive a full speed and get a miracle in a pretty tight timeline now i thought how could i really capture this is there's some kind of natural illustration some demonstration that would grab people's imagination here i thought back to a year ago when i brought mosquitoes and somehow people enjoyed that it really got them involved in the idea of you know there are people who lived in mosquitoes so with energy i like to come up with is this i decided that releasing fireflies would be my contribution to the environment here this year so here we have some natural fly flies i'm told they don't bite in fact they might even not even leave that jar now there's all sorts of geeky solutions like that one but they don't really add up too much we need solutions either one or several that have unbelievable scale and unbelievable reliability and although there's many directions of people seeking i really only see five that can achieve the big numbers i've left out time geothermal fusion biopules those may make some contribution and if they can do better than i expect so much the better but my key point here is that we're going to have to work on each of these five and we can't give up any of them because they look daunting because they all that have significant challenges let's look first at the burning fossil fuels either burning coal or burning natural gas what you need to do there it seems like it might be simple but it's not and that's to take all the co two after you burn it going out the flu pressurize it create a liquid put it somewhere and hope it stays there now we have some pilot things that do this at the sixty to eighty percent level but getting up to that full percentage that will be very tricky and a green on where these co two quantity should be put will be hard but the toughest one here is this long term issue who's going to be sure who's going to guarantee something that is literally billions of times larger than any type of waste you think of in terms of nuclear other things this is a lot of volume so that's the top one next would be nuclear it also has three big problems cost particularly in highly regulated countries is high the issue of the safety really feeling good about nothing can go wrong that even though you have these human operators that the fuel it doesn't get used for weapons and then what do you do with the waste although it's not very large there are a lot of concerns about that people need to feel good about it so three very tough problems that might be solvable and so should be worked on the last three of the five i've grouped together these are what people often refer to as the renewable sources and they actually although it's great they don't require fuel they have some disadvantages one is that the density of energy gather in these technologies is dramatically less than a power plant this is energy farming so you're talking about many square miles thousands of times more area than you think of as a normal energy plant also these are interment and sources the sun doesn't shine all day it doesn't shine every day and likewise the wind doesn't blow all the time and so you depend on these sources you have to have some way of getting energy during those time periods that it's not available so we've got big cost challenges here we have transmission challenges for example say this energy sources outside your country you not only need the technology but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from elsewhere and finally this storage problem and dimensionalized this i went through and looked at all the types of batteries that get made for cars for computers for phones for flashlights for everything and compared that to the amount of electrical energy the world uses and what i found is that all the batteries we make now could store less than ten minutes of all the energy and so in fact we need a big breakthrough here something that's going to be a factor of one hundred better than the approaches we have now it's not impossible but it's not a very easy thing now this shows up when you try to get the internet source to be above say twenty to thirty percent of what you're using if you're counting on it for one hundred percent you need an incredible miracle battery now how we're going to go forward on this what's the right approach is that a banhattan project what's the thing that can get us there well we need lots of companies working on this hundreds in each of these five paths we need at least one hundred people and a lot of them you look at and say they're crazy that's good and i think here in the ted group we have many people who are already pursuing this bill gross has several companies and clear one called e solar that has some great solar thermal technology the node colsas investing in dozens of companies that are doing great things and have interesting possibilities and i'm trying to help back that uneither marble than i actually are back in a company that perhaps surprisingly is actually taking the nuclear approach there are some innovations in nuclear modular liquid and innovation really stopped in this industry quite some time ago so the idea that there is some good ideas laying around is not all that surprising the idea of terror power is that instead of burning the part of uranium the one percent is that you two thirty five we decided well let's burn the ninety nine percent the u two thirty eight it is kind of a crazy idea in fact people have talked about it for a long time but they could never simulate properly whether it would work or not and so it threw the advent of modern supercomputers that now you can simulate and see that yes with the right materials approach this looks like it would work because you're bringing that ninety nine percent you have
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3659038)[0m everybody talks about happiness these days i had somebody count the number of books with happiness in the title published in the last five years and they gave up after about forty and there were many more and there is a huge wave of interest in happiness among researchers there is a lot of happiness culturing everybody would like to make people happier but in spread of all this flood of work there are several cognitive traps that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight about happiness and my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive traps this applies to lay people thinking about their own happiness and it applies to scholars thinking about happiness because it turns out we're just as messed up as anybody else's the first of these traps are reluctance to admit complexity it turns out that the word happiness is just not a useful word anymore because we applied to too many different things i think there is one particular meaningful to which we might restrict it but by and large this is something that we'll have to give up and we'll have to adopt a more complicated view of what well being is the second trap is a confusion between experience and memory basically it's between being happy in your life and being happy about your life so happy with your life and those are two very different concepts and they're both lumped in the notion of happiness and the third is it's the focusing illusion and it's the unfortunate fact that we can't think about any circumstance that affects will be without distorting it's important i mean this is a real cognitive prop there's just no way of getting it right now i'd like to start with an example of somebody with a question an answer session after one of my lectures and reported a story and that was a story he said he had been listening to a symphony and it was absolutely glorious music and at the very end of the recording there was a dreadful screeching sound and then he added really quite emotionally and it drew in the whole experience but it happened when it had ruined with the memory of the experience he had had the experience he had had twenty minutes of glorious music they counted for nothing because he was left with the memory the memory was ruined and the memory was all that he had gotten keep what this is telling us really is that we might be thinking of ourselves and other people in terms of two cells there is an experiencing self who lives in the present and knows the present it's capable of re living the past but basically it has only the present it's the experiencing self that the doctor approaches you know when the doctor does it hurt now when i thought you hear and then there is a remembering self and the remembering self is the one that keeps score and maintains the story of our life and it's the one that the doctor approaches in asking the question how have you been feeling lately how is your trip torbania or something like that those are two very different entities the experiencing self and the remembering self and getting confused between them is part of the mess about the notion of happiness now the remembering self is a storyteller and that really starts with a basic a response of our memory it starts immediately we don't only tell stories when we set out to tell stories our memory tells our stories that is what we get to keep from our experiences is a story and let me begin with one example this is an old study those are actual patients undergoing a painful procedure i won't go into detail it's no longer painful these days but it was painful when they when the study was run in the nineteen nineties there is a report on their pain every sixty seconds and here are two patients those are their recordings and you are ask who of them suffered more and it's a very easy question i mean clearly patient be suffered more it's clonoscopy was longer and every a minute of pain that patient a had patient b had and more but now there's another question how much did these patients think they suffer and here is a surprise and the surprise is that patient a had a much worse memory of the clonoscopy the patient b the stories of the clonoscopies were different and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends and neither these stories is very inspiring or great but one of them is distinct but one of them is distinctly worse than the other and the one that is worse is the one where pain was that it speaks at the very end it's a bad story how do we know that because we asked these people after their colonoscopy and much later too how bad was the whole thing in total and it was much worse for aid than for me in memory now this is a direct conflict between the experiencing self and the remembering self from the point of view the experiencing self clearly be at a worst time now what you could do with patient aid and we actually ran clinical experiments and it has been done and it does work you could actually extend the monoscopy of patient aid by just keeping the tubin without driggling it too much that will that will cause the patient to suffer but just a little and much less than before and if you do that for a couple of minutes you have made the experiencing self of patient a will sof and you've made the remembering self of patient a lot better off because now you have a doubt patient a with a better story about his experience what defines a story and that is true of the stories that memory delivers for us and it's also true of the stories that we make up what finds a story changes significant moments and endings endings are very very important and in this case you know the ending dominated now the experiencing self lives its life continuously has moments of experience one after the other and you can ask what happens to these moments and the answer is really straightforward they are lost forever i mean most of the moments

this way the distinction between the happiness of the experiencing self and the satisfaction of the remembering self has been recognized in recent years and there are now efforts to measure the two separately the gallop organization as a world poll with more than half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about their experiences and there have been other efforts along those lines so in recent years we have begun to learn about the happiness of the two cells
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3659050)[0m so i've known a lot of fish in my life i've loved only too the first one was it was more like a passionate affair it was a beautiful fish a flavorful textured me the best seller on the menu what a fish even better it was farm raised to the supposed highest standards of sustainability so you can feel good about selling it i was in a relationship with this beauty for several months one day the head of the company called and as if i'd speak out an event about the farm sustainability absolutely i said here is a company trying to solve but what's become this unimaginable problem for ashefs how do we keep fish on our menus for the past fifty years we've been fishing the seas like we clear cut forests it's hard to overstate the destruction ninety percent of large fish the ones we love the tunas the hellbits the salmon's swordfish the collapse there's nothing left so for better for worse agriculture fish farming part of our future a lot of arguments against it fish farms pollute most of them do anyway and they're inefficient take tuna a major drawback it's got a feed conversion ratio of fifteen to one that means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish to get you one pound a farm tuna not very sustainable it doesn't taste very good either so here finally it was a company trying to do it right i wanted to support the day before the event i called they had a pr for the company let's call him done donna said just to get the factor you guys are famous for farming so far out to see you don't pollute that's where he said we're so far out the waste of my fish gets distributed not concentrated and then he added are basically a world into ourselves a few conversion ratio two point five to one he said best in the business two point five to one great two point five what what what do you feed sustainable proteins he said great i said got off the phone and that night i was lying in bed and i thought what the hell is a sustainable protein so the next day just before the event i called down i said down what are some examples of sustainable proteins he said even know he would ask around well i got on the phone and a few people in the company no one could give me a straight answer until finally i got on the phone with the head biologist let's call him down to donna said what are some examples of sustainable proteins well we mentioned some algaees and some fish meals and then he said chicken palats as a chicken pox he said yeah feather skin bone meal scraps dried and processed into feat he said what percentage of your feed is chicken thinking two percent what's about thirty percent he said i said don what's sustainable about feeding chicken fish there's a long pause on the line and he said there's just too much chicken in the world i fell out of love with this fish now not because some self righteous goody too shoes foody i actually am and i fell out of love with this fish because i sort of got after that conversation the fish tasted like chicken the second fish what's a different kind of love story it's the romantic kind a kind where the more you get to know your fish you love the fish i first ate at a restaurant in southern spain a journalist friend have been talking about this fish for a long time she kind of set us up ok it came to the table a bright almost simmering light color the chef had overcooked it like twice amazingly it was still delicious who can make a fish taste good after it's been overcooked i can't but this guy can't let's call him mego actually his name is mego and now he didn't cook the fish and he's not a chef at least in the way that you and i understand is a biologist at vetla pama it's a fish farm in the southwestern corner of spain it's at the tip of the guala cavere river until the nineteen eighties the farm was in the hands of the argentinians they raised beef cattle what was essentially wetlands they did it by training land they built this intricate series of canals and they pushed water off the land and out into the river well it couldn't make it work not economically and ecologically it was disaster killed ninety percent of the birds which for this place is a lot of birds and so in nineteen eighty two a spanish company with an environmental conscience purchased the land what did they do they reverse the flow of water they literally flip the switch instead of pushing water out they used the channels to pull water back in they flooded the canous they created a twenty seven thousand acre fish fund up bas mallet shrimp wheel any in the process negal and this company it completely reversed the ecological destruction now the farm is incredible i mean you've never seen anything like this you stare out at a horizon that is a million miles away and all you see are flooded canals and this thick rich marshland i was there not long ago with me and he's an amazing guy like three parts charles darwin and one part crocodile done be ok but here we are slowing through the wetland you know i'm panting and sweating i'm mut up to my knees and he is commly conducting a biology lecture here he's pointing out a rare black shoulder kite now he's mentioning the mineral needs of phytoplankton and here here he sees a grouping pattern that reminds him of the tanzanian giraff it turns out megal spent the better part of his career in the macumi national park in africa i asked him how he became such an expert on fish he said fish i don't know anything about fish i'm an expert in relationships and then he's off launching the more talk about rare birds and algaees and strange aquatic plants and don't get me wrong i was really fascinating you know the biotic community unplugged kind of thing you know it's great but i was in love and my head was sooning over that overcooked piece of delicious fish i had the night before i interacted and i said me now what makes your fish taste so good you point at the algae i know do the algae the phytoplankton the relationships amazing right but what are your fish eating what's the feed conversion ratio what goes on to tell me it's such a rich system that the fish are eating what they meeting in the wild the plant biomass the fight upline the zoo plants it's what feeds the fish the system is so healthy it's totally selfurning there is no feed ever heard of a farm that doesn't feed its animals later that day i was driving around this property with me go and i asked them i said for a place it seems so natural unlike any fish allegate farm i'd ever been at how do you measure success at that moment it's as if a film director called for a set change and we rounded the corner and saw the most amazing site thousands and thousands of pink filming gos a literal pink carpet as far as you can see that success he said look at their ballies pink they're fishing feasting i was totally confused i said me aren't they feasting on your fish yes he said we lose twenty percent of our fish and fish eggs to birds last year this property had six hundred thousand birds on it more than two hundred and fifty different species it's become today the largest and one of the most important the private bird sanctuaries in all of europe i said me go isn't a thriving bird population like the last thing you want on a fish farm he should have said no he said that we farm extensively not intensively this is an ecological network the flumingos eat the shrimp the shrimp eat the fightoplankton so the pink of the belly the better the system ok so let's reveal a farm that doesn't feed its animals in a form that measures its success and the health of its predators a fish farm but also a bird sanctuary oh and by the way those flamingos they shouldn't even be there in the first place they brewed in a town one hundred and fifty miles away where the soil conditions are better for buildings every morning they fly one hundred and fifty miles into the farm and every evening they fly one hundred and fifty miles back they do that because they're able to follow the broken white line of highway a ninety two no kidding now i was imagining a march of the penguins thing so i looked at me go i said let me go do they fly one hundred and fifty miles to the farm and then do they fly one hundred and fifty miles back at night do they do that for the children he looked at me like i just quoted a whitney used and song he said no they do it because the food's better you know i didn't mention the skin of my beloved fish which was delicious and i don't like fish skin i don't like it seared i don't like it crispy as that accurate tar like flavor i almost never cop with it yet when i tasted it at that restaurant in southern spain it tasted not it all like fiskin it tasted sweet and clean like you were taking a bit of the ocean i mentioned that to me and he nodded he said the skin acts like a fuge it's the last defense before anything enters the body it evolved up to soake up in purities and then he added but our water has no impurities ok a farm that doesn't feed its fish a farm that measures the success by the success of its predators and then i realized what he says a farm that has no impurities he made a big understatement because the water that flows through that farm comes in from the gudulk of your river it's a river that carries with it all the things that rivers tend to carry these days chemical contaminants pesticide runoff and when it works its way through the system and leaves the water it's cleaner than when it enter the system is so healthy it purifies the water so not just a farm that doesn't feed its animals not just a farm that measures the health it's successed by the health of its predators but a farm that's literally a water perification plant and not just for those fish but for you and me as well because when that water leaves it dumps out into the atlantic a drop in the ocean i know but i'll take it and so should you because this love story however romantic is also instructive you might say it's a recipe for the future of good food whether we're talking about bass or beef cattle what we need now is a radically new conception of agriculture one in which the food actually tastes good but for a lot of people that's a bit too radical we're not real as us foods we're lumbers we love farmers markets we love small family farms we talk about local food we organic and when you suggest these are the things that will ensure the future of good food someone somewhere stands up and says hey yeah now i love pink flaming us now how you go and feed the world how are you going to feed the world can i be honest i don't love that question no not because we already produce enough calories to more than feed the world one billion people will go hungry today one billion that's more than ever before because of gross inequalities and distribution not tunish now i don't love this question because it's determined the logic of our food system for the last fifty years speed grained herbivores pesticides to monocultures chemicals to soil chicken to fish and all along agribusiness has simply asked if we're feeding more people more cheaply how terrible could that be that's been the motivation it's been the destication it's been the business plan of american agriculture we should call what it is a business in liquidation a business that's quickly eroting ecological capital that makes that very production possible that's not a business and it is agriculture our breadbasket is threatened today not because of diminishing supply but because of diminishing resources
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3659049)[0m that's ted right here we have a machine a big machine a cool tedish machine and it's a time machine and everyone in this room's again into it and you can go backwards you can go forwards you cannot stay where you are and i wonder what you'd choose because i've been asking my friends this question a lot lately and they all want to go back i don't know i want to go back before there were automobiles or twitter or american idle i don't know i'm convinced that there's some sort of pull and nostalgia to wishful thinking and i understand that i'm not part of that crowd i have to say but i don't want to go back and it's not because i'm adventurous it's because possibilities on this planet they don't go back they go forward so i want to get in the machine and i want to go forward this is the greatest time there's ever been on this planet by any measure that you wish to choose health wealth but mobility opportunity declining rates of disease there's never been a time like this my great grandparents died all of them by the time they were sixty my grandparents pushed that number to seventy my parents were closing in our navy so they're better be it they're better be a nine in the beginning of my death number but it's not even about people like us because now this is a bigger deal than that a kid born in new delhi today can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world did one hundred years ago think about that it's an incredible fact and why is it true smallpox smallpox killed billions of people on this planet it reshaped the demography of the globe in a way that no more ever has it's gone now it's vanished we've vanquished it both in the rich world diseases that threatened millions of us just a generation ago no longer exists hardly dipheria rebella polio does anyone even know what those things are vaccines modern medicine our ability to feed billions of people those are triumphs of the scientific method into my mind the scientific method trying stuff out seeing if it works changing it when it doesn't is one of the great accomplishments of humanity so that's the good news unfortunately that's all the good news because there's some other problems and they've been mentioned many times and one of them is that despite all the accomplishments a billion people go to bed hungry in this world every day that number is rising and it's rising really rapidly and it's discraceful and not only that we've used our imagination to thoroughly trash this globe potable water arable land rainforests oil gas they're going away and they're going away soon and unless we innovate our way out of this mess we're going away to so the question is can we do that and i think we can i think it's clear that we can make food that will feed billions of people without raping the land that they live on i think we can power this world with energy that doesn't also destroy it i really do believe that and no it ain't wishful thinking but here's the thing that keeps me up at night one of the things that keeps me up at night we've never needed progress in science more than we need it right now never and we've also never been in a position to deploy it properly in the way that we can today we're on the verge of amazing amazing events in many fields and yet i actually think we'd have to go back hundreds three hundred years before the enlightenment to find a time when we battle progress when we thought about these things more vigorously on more fronts than we do now people wrap themselves in their beliefs and they do it so tightly that you can't set them free not even the truth will set them free and listen everyone's entitled to their opinion they're even entitled to their opinion about progress but you know you're not entitled to you're not entitled to your own facts sorry you're not and this took me a while to figure out about a decade ago i wrote a story about vaccines from the new yorker a little story and i was amazed to find opposition opposition to what is after all the most effective public health measure in human history i know what to do so i just did what i do i wrote a story and i moved on and soon after that i wrote a story about genetically engineered food same thing only bigger people were going crazy so i wrote a story about that too and i couldn't understand why people thought this was franking foods why they thought moving molecules around in a specific rather than a half hazard way was trespassing on nature's ground but you know i do what i do i wrote this story i moved on i mean i'm a journalist we type we file we go to dinner it's fun but these stories bothered me and i couldn't figure out why and eventually i did and that's because of those fanatics that were driving me crazy weren't actually fanatics at all they were thoughtful people educated people decent people they were exactly like the people in this room and it just disturbed me so much but then i thought you know let's be honest we're at a point in this world but where we don't have the same relationship to progress that we used to talk about it ambivalently we talk about it in ironic terms with little quotes around it progress ok there are reasons for that and i think we know what those reasons are we've lost faith and institutions in authority and sometimes in science itself and there's no reason we should enough you can just say a few names and people will understand a ternoble bopal the challenger viox weapons of mass destruction hanging chads i mean you know you can choose your list there are questions and problems with the people we used to believe we're always right so be skeptical ask questions demand proof demand evidence don't take anything for granted but here's the thing when you get proof you need to accept the proof and we're not that good at doing that and the reason that i can say that is because we're now in an epidemic of fear like one that i've never seen and hope never to see again about twelve years ago there was a story published a horrible story that linked the epidemic of autism to the misles months and rebella vaccine shot very scary tons of studies were done to see if this was true tons of studies should have been done it's in a serious issue the data came back the data came back from the united states from england from sweden from canada and it was all the same no correlation no connection none at all but doesn't matter it doesn't matter because we believe anecdotes we believe what we see what we think we see what makes us feel real but we don't believe a bunch of documents from a government official giving us data and i do understand that i think we all do but you know what the result of that has been disastrous disasters because here's a fact the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the vaccine rate for musels is going down that is disgraceful and we should be ashamed of ourselves it's horrible what kind of a thing happened that we could do that now i understand it i do understand it because who did anyone have museles here it is one person in this audience ever see someone die of museles it doesn't happen very much it doesn't happen in this country at all but it happened one hundred and sixty thousand times in the world last year that's a lot of death of measles twenty an hour but since it didn't happen here we can put it out of our minds and people like gening the carte can go around preaching messages of fear and illiteracy from platforms like oprah and larry king live and they can do it because they don't make causation and correlation they don't understand that these things seem the same but they're almost never the same and it's something we need to learn and we need to learn it really soon this guy was a hero jonas saw he took one of the worst scourges of mankind away from us no fear no agony polio push gone that guy in the middle not so much his name is paul ask he just developed a roto virus vaxing with a bunch of other people it will save the lives of four hundred five hundred thousand kids in the developing world every year pretty good right what's good except the pog goes around talking about vaccines and says how valuable they are and the people ought to just stop the lining and he actually says it that way so pos a terrorist when paul speaks in a public hearing he can't testify without arm guards he gets called at home because people like to tell them that they remember where his kids go to school and why because paul made a vaccine i don't need to say this but vaccines are essential you take them away disease comes back horrible diseases and that's happening we have muss in this country now and it's getting worse and pretty soon kids are going to die again because it's just a numbers game and they're not just going to die of misels what about polio let's have that why not a college classmate of mine wrote a couple of weeks ago and said you know she thought it was a little stride into one's ever said that before and she wasn't going to vaccinate her kid against polio no way fine why because we don't have polio and you know what we didn't have polio in this country yesterday today i don't know maybe a guy got on a plane in lagos this morning and he's flying to l ax right now he's over ohio and he's going to land in a couple hours he's going to run a car and he's going to come to long beach and he's going to tend one of these fabulous ted dinners tonight and he doesn't know that he's infected with a paralytic disease and we know either because that's the way the world works that's the planet we live on don't pretend it isn't now we love to wrap ourselves in lives we love to do it everyone take their vitulins this morning a little any accident to get you going i know you did because half of americans do every day they take the stuff and they take alternative medicines and it doesn't matter how often we find out that they're useless the data says it all the time they darken your ear and they almost never do more than that it took you want to pay twenty eight billion dollars for dark r and i'm totally with you dark urine dark why do we do that why do we do that well i think i understand we hate big farmer we hate big government we don't trust the man and we should it our healthcare system sucks it's cruel to millions of people it's absolutely astonishing cold and sole dending to those of us who can even afford it so we run away from it and where do we run we leap into the arms of big placebo that's fantastic i love big but it's really a serious thing because this stuff is crap and we spend billions of dollars on it and i have all sorts of little crops here none of the geek frog a canadia frog a car i don't even know what that is but we're spending billions of dollars on it it's frog and you know what when i say this stuff people scream at me and they said wouldn't care but people do what they want to do it makes them feel good and you know what you're wrong because i don't care if it's the secretary of ts who's saying who i'm not going to take the evidence of my experts on mammograms or some cancer clock who wants to treat his patient with coffee animals when you start down the road where belief in magic replace evidence in science you end up in a place you don't want to be you end up in tabo and becky south africa he killed four hundred thousand of his people by insisting that beat route garlic and lemon oil were much more effective than the antiretroviral judges we know can slow the course of aids hundreds of thousands of deless deaths in a country that has been plagued worse than any other by this disease please don't tell me there are no consequences to these things there are there always are now the most mindless epidemic we're in the middle of right now is this absurd battle between the proponents of genetically engineered food and the organic meat it's an idiotic debate it has to stop it's a debate about words about metaphors it's ideology it's not science every single thing we eat every grain of rice every spring of parsley every brustle sprat has been modified by man you know there weren't ten genes in the garden of eden there wasn't any canop
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3659056)[0m i grew up on study diet of sides fiction in high school i took a bus to school an hour each way every day and i was always absorbed in a book science fiction book which took my mind to other worlds and satisfied in a narrative form this insatiable sense of curiosity that i had and you know that curiosity also manifested itself in the fact that whenever i was in school i was out in the woods hiking and taking samples frogs and snakes and bugs and pond water and bringing it back looking at it under the microscope i was you know i was real science peak but it was all about trying to understand understand the world understand the limits of possibility and my love of science fiction actually seemed to be mirred in the world around me because what was happening this was in the late sixties you know we were going to the moon we were exploring the deep oceans jacques cousteau was coming into our living rooms with his amazing specials that showed us animals and places in a wondrous world that we could never really have previously imagined so that seemed to resonate with the whole science fiction part of it and i was an artist i could draw paint and i found that because there weren't video games and this saturation of sg movies and all of this imagery in the media landscape i had to create these images in my head you know we all did as kids having to read a book and through the office description put something on the screen the movie screen in our heads and so my response to this was to paint to draw alien creatures alien worlds robots spaceships all that stuff i was endlessly getting busted in math class you know doodling behind the textbook and that was the creativity had to find its outlet somehow and an interesting thing happened there jack cousteo that shows actually got me very excited about the fact that there was an alien world right here on earth i might not really go to an alien world on a spaceship someday that seemed pretty darn unlikely but that was a world i could really go to right here on earth it was as rich and exotic as anything that i had imagined from reading these books so i decided i was going to become a scuba diver at the age of fifteen and the only problem with that was that i lived in a little village in canada six hundred miles from the nearest ocean but i didn't let that daunt me i pastured my father until he finally found a scuba class in buffalo new york right across the border from where we live then i actually got certified in a pool at a ymca in the dead of winter in buffalo new york and i didn't see the ocean a real ocean for another two years and so we moved to california and now since then in the intervening forty years i've spent about three thousand hours underwater and five hundred hours of that was in submersibles and i've learned that that deep ocean environment and even the shallow oceans are so rich with amazing life that really is beyond beyond our imagination and nature's imagination is so so boundless compared to our own mere human imagination i still to this day stand in absolute awe of what i see when i make these dives and i love afair with the oceans is ongoing and just as strong as it ever was but when i chose career as an adult it was filmmaking and that seemed to be the best way to reconcile this urge i had to tell stories with my urges to create images and i was as a kid constantly drawing comic puts and so on so film making was the way to put pictures and stories together and that made sense and of course the stories that i chose to tell were science fiction stories terminator aliens then the abyss and with the abyss i was putting together my love of underwater and diving with filmmaking so you know merging the two passions something interesting came out of the abyss which was to solve a specific narrative problem on that film which was to create this kind of liquid water creature we actually embraced a computer generated animation sg and this resulted in the first soft surface character seg animation that was ever in him in a movie and even though child been making money bare and broke even i should say i witness something amazing which is that the audience the global audience was mesmerized by this apparent magic you know arthur clark's law and any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable for magic they were seeing something magical and so that got me very excited i thought wow this is something that needs to be embraced into the systematic art so with terminator two which was my next film we took that much further working with ilm we created the liquid metal dude in that film and the success i in the balance on whether that effect would work and it did and we created magic again and we had the same result with an audience although we didn't make a little more money on that way so you know doctory aline through those two two dots of experience came to this is going to be a whole new world this is a whole new world of creativity for for film artists so i started a company with stan winson my good friend stan winson who is the premier makeup and creature designer at that time and it was called digital domain and the concept of the company was that we would leapfrog past the kind of analog processes of optical printers and so on and we would go right to digital production and we actually did that and it gave us a competitive advantage for a while but we found ourselves lagging in the mid nineties in the creature and character design stuff that we had actually founded the company to do so i wrote this piece called avatar which was meant to absolutely push the envelope of visual effects of sg effects beyond with realistic human emotive characters generated in sg and the main characters would all be in sg and the world would be in sg and well you know the emblo pushed back and i was told by folks at my company that we weren't going to be able to do this for a while so i shelved it and i made this other movie about a big ship at six and you know i went in pitch it to the studio as romeo and juliet on a ship it's going to be this epic romance passionate the film secretly what i wanted to do was i wanted to dive to the real reck of titanic and that's why i made the mov and that's the truth now the studio didn't know that but i convinced them i said i said we're going to dive to the reck we're going to film it for real we'll be using it in the opening of the film it will be really important to be a great marketing hook and i talked them into funding an expedition sounds crazy but this goes back to that theme about your imagination creating a reality actually created a reality where six months later i found myself in a russian submersible at two and a half miles down in the north atlantic looking at the real titanic through through a real port not a movie not hd for real now that blew my mind and you know it took a lot of preparation we had to build cameras and lights and all kinds of things but it struck me how much this dive these deep dives like a space mission you know where it was highly technical and required enormous planning and you get in this capsule you go down to this dark hostile environment where there's no hope of rescue if you can't get back by yourself and you know i've thought wow i'm like living in a science fiction movie this is really cool and so i really got bitten by the bug of deep ocean exploration of course the curiosity of the science component of it it was everything it was an adventure it was curiosity it was imagination and it was an experience that hollywood couldn't give me because you know i could imagine a creature and we could create a visual effect for it but i couldn't imagine what i was seeing out that window as we did some of our subsequent expeditions so i was seeing creatures at hydrothermal vents and sometimes things that i had never seen before sometimes things that no one had seen before that actually were not described by science at the time that we saw them and image them so i was completely smitten by this and had to do more and so i actually made a kind of curious decision after the success of titanic i said okay you know i'm going to park my day job as a hollywood movie maker and i'm going to go be a full time explorer for a while and so we started planning these expeditions and we wound up going to the bismark and exploring with robotic vehicles we went back to the titanic rec we took little bots that we had created this spool of fiber optic and the idea was to go in and do an interior survey of that ship which had never been done nobody had ever looked inside the rect that didn't have the means to do it so we created technology to do it so here i am now on the deck of titanic sitting in a submersible and looking out at planks that look much like this where i knew that the band had played and i'm flying a little robotic vehicle through the corridor of the ship you know when i say you know i'm operating it but my mind is in the vehicle i felt like i was physically present inside the shipwreck of titanic and it was the most sereal kind of day job experience i've ever had because i would know before i turned to corner what was going to be there before the lights of the vehicle actually revealed it because i had walked the set for months and we were making the movie and the set was based as an exact replica on the blueprints of the ship so there was this absolutely remarkable experience and it really it made me realize that you know the telepresence experience that you actually can have these robotic avatars then your consciousness is injected into the vehicle into this other form of existence and it was really really quite profound and maybe a little bit of a glimpse to what might be happening some decades out as as we start to have cyberg bodies for exploration for other means in many sort of post human futures that i can imagine as a science fiction fan so having done these expeditions and you know really beginning to appreciate what was down there such the deep ocean vents where we had these amazing amazing animals they're basically aliens right here on earth they live in an environment of chemosynthesis they don't survive out on sunlight based system the way we do and so you're seeing animals that are living next to a five hundred degree centigrade water plumes that you think they can't possibly exist at the same time and i was getting very interested in space science as well again you know the science fiction influence as a kid and i wound up getting involved with the space community really involved with nasa sitting on the nasa advise reward planning actual space missions going to russia going through the pre cosmo biomedical protocols and all these sorts of things to actually go and fly to the international space station with our three d camera systems and this was fascinating but what i wound up doing was bringing space scientists with us into the deep and taking them down so that they had access astrobiologists planetary scientists people who were interested in these extreme file environments taking them down to the events and letting them see and take samples and test instruments and so on so here we were making documentary films but actually doing science and actually doing space science i completely closed the loop between being the science fiction fan as a kid and doing this stuff for real and you know along the way in this journey of discovery i learned a lot i learned a lot about science but i also learned a lot about leadership now you think directors got to be a leader leader captain of the ship all that sort of thing i really learned about leadership until i did these expeditions because i had to at a certain point saying what am i doing out here why am i doing this what do i get out of it we don't make money at these damn shows you know we barely break even there's no famine people sort of think i went away between titanic and avatar and was buffing my nails someplace you know sitting at the beach made all these films made all these documentary films that you know for very limited audience no fame no glory no money what are you doing you're doing it for the task itself for the challenge and the ocean is the most challenging environment there is for the thrill of discovery and for that strange bond that happens when a small group of people form a tightly knit team because we would do these things with ten twelve people working for years at a time sometimes that sea for two three months at a time and in that bond you realize that the most important thing is the respect that you have for them and that they have for you that you've done a task that you can't explain to someone else when you come back to the shore and you say we had to do this and the fiber optic and the attenuation and all the technology of it and the difficulty the human performance aspects of working at sea
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3659045)[0m i'm game i'm a game designer in making games online now for ten years and my goal for the next decade is to try to make it as easy to save the world in real life as it is to save the world in online games now i have a plan for this and it entails convincing more people including all of you to spend more time playing bigger and better games right now we spend three billion hours a week playing online games some of you might be thinking that's a lot of time to spend playing games maybe too much time considering how many urgent problems we have to solve in the real world but actually according to my research at the institute for the future it's actually the opposite is true three billion hours a week is not nearly enough game play to solve the world's most urgent problems in fact i believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet we need to increase that total dramatically i've calculated the total we need at twenty one billion hours of game play every week so that's probably a bit of a counterintuitive idea so i'll just say it again let it sync in and if we want to solve problems like hunger poverty climate change global conflict obesity with i believe that we need to aspire to play games online for at least twenty one billion hours a week by the end of the next decade now i'm serious i am here's why this picture pretty much sums up why i think games are so essential to the future survival of the human species truly this is a portrait by a photographer named phil told dono he wanted to capture the emotion of gaming so we set up a camera in front of gamers while they were playing and this is a classic gaming emotion now if you're not a gamer you might miss some of the nuance in this photo you probably see the sense of urgency a little bit of but fear but intense concentration deep deep focus on tackling a really difficult problem if you are a gamer you will notice a few nuances here the crinkle of the eyes up and around the mouth is the sign of optimism and the highbrls up is surprised this is a gamer who's on the verge of something called an epic wind no well you heard of that okay good so we have some gamers among us so an epic win is an outcome that is so extraordinarily positive you had no idea it was even possible until you achieved it it was almost beyond the threshold of imagination and when you get there you're shocked to discover what you're truly capable of that's an epic win this is a gamer on the verge of an ethic win and this is the face that we need to see on millions of problem solvers all over the world as we try to tackle the obstacles of the next century the face of someone who against all odds is on the verge of an epic win now unfortunately this is more of the face that we see in everyday life now as we try to tackle urgent problems this is what i call the i'm not good at life face and this is actually me making it can you see it yes good this is actually me making the i'm not good at life face this is a piece of graffiti in my old neighborhood in berkeley california where i did my phd on why we're better in games than we are in real life and this is a problem that a lot of gamers have we feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games and i don't mean just good as in successful although it's part of it we do achieve more in game worlds but i also mean good as in motivated to do something that matters inspired to collaborate and to cooperate when we're in game worlds i believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves the most likely to help at a moment notice the most likely to stick with a problem as long as it takes to get up after failure and try again and in real life when we face failure when we confront obstacles we often don't feel that way we feel overcome we feel overwhelmed we feel anxious may be depressed frustrated or cynical we never have this feelings from we're playing games they just don't exist in games so that's what i wanted to study when i was a graduate student what about games makes it impossible to feel that we can't achieve everything how can we take those feelings from games and apply them to real world work so i looked at games like world of warcraft which is really the ideal collaborative problem solving environment and i started to notice a few things that make epequins so possible in allline worlds so the first thing is whenever you show up in one of these allline games especially in world of worecraft there are lots and lots of different characters who are willing to trust you with a world saving mission right away but not just any mission it's a mission that is perfectly matched with your current level in the game right so you can do it they never give you a challenge that you can't achieve but it is on the verge of what you're capable of so you have to try hard but there's no unemployment in world of warcraft there's no sitting around bringing your hands there is always something specific and important to be done and there are also tons of collaborators everywhere you go hundreds of thousands of people ready to work with you to achieve your epic mission that's not something we have in real life that easily the sense that at our fingertips are tons of collaborators and also this epic story this inspiring story of why were there and what we're doing and then we get all this positive feedback you guys have heard of leveling up and plus one strength plus ones intelligence we don't get the kind of constant feedback in real life when i get off the stage i'm not going to have plus one speaking and plus one crazy idea plus twenty crazy idea i don't get that feedback in real life now the problem with collaborative online environments like world of warcraft is that it's so satisfying to be on the verge of an epic one all the time that we decide to spend all our time in these game worlds it's just better than reality so so far collectively all the road of warcraft gamers have spent five point nine three million years solving the virtual problems of asora now that's not necessarily a bad thing it might sound like it's a bad thing but to put that in context five point nine three million years ago was when our earliest primate human ancestors stood up that was the first upright primate ok so when we talk about how much time we're currently investing in playing games the only way it makes sense to even think about it is to talk about time at the magnitude of human evolution which is an extraordinary thing but it's also act because it turns out that by spending all this time playing games we're actually changing what we are capable of as human beings we're evolving to be more collaborative and hardy species this is true i believe this so consider this really interesting statistic i was recently published by a researcher at carnegie mellon university the average young person today in a country with a strong gamer culture will have spent ten thousand hours playing online games by the age of twenty one now ten thousand hours is a really interesting number for two reasons first of all for children in the united states ten thousand and eighty hours is the exact amount of time you will spend in school from fifth grade to high school graduation if you have perfect attendance we have an entire parallel track of education going on where young people are learning as much about what it takes to be a good gamer as they're learning about everything else in school but some of you have probably read malcolm gladwell's new book outliers so you would have heard of his theory of success the ten thousand hour theory of success it's based on this great cognitive science research that if we can master ten thousand hours of effortful study at anything by the age of twenty one we will be virtuoso that it will be as good at whatever we do as the greatest people in the world and so now what we're looking at is an entire generation of young people who are virtuoso gamers so the big question is what exactly our gamer is getting so good at because if we could figure that out we would have a virtually unprecedented human resource on our hands this is how many people we have in the world who spend at least an hour a day playing online games these are virtuoso gamers five hundred million people who are extraordinarily good at something and in the next decade we're going to have another billion gamers who are extraordinarily good at whatever that is if you don't know it already this is coming the game industry is developing consols that are low energy and that work with the wireless phone networks instead of broadband internet so that gamers all over the world particularly in india that china brazil can get online they expect one billion more gamers in the next decade so it brings up to one point five billion gamers so i started to think about what these games are making us virtuous as a here are the four things i came up with the first is urgent optimism okay think of this as extreme self motivation urgent optimism is the desire to act immediately to tackle an obstacle combined with the belief that we have a reasonable hope of success but gamers always believe that an epic one is possible i mean it is always worth trying and trying now game results around gamers are virtuosos at weaving a tight social fabric there's a lot of interesting research that shows that we like people better after we play a game with them even if they beaten us badly the reason is it takes a lot of trust to play a game with someone we trust that they will spend their time with us that they will play by the same rules value the same goal they'll stay with the game until it's over and so playing a game together actually builds up bonds and trust and cooperation and we actually build stronger social relationships as a result blissful productivity i love it you know there's a reason why the average world of warcraft gamer plays for twenty two hours a week kind of a half time job it's because we know when we're playing a game that we're actually happier working hard than we are but relaxing or hanging out we know that we are optimized as human beings to do hard meaningful work and gamers are willing to work hard all the time if they're given the right work finally epic meaning and gamers love to be attached to inspiring missions to human planetary scale stories so just one bit of trivia that helps put that into perspective so you all know wikipedia the biggest wiki in the world second biggest wiki in the world with nearly eighty thousand articles is the world of warcraft wiki five million people use it every month they have compiled more information about world of warcraft on the internet than any other topic covered on any other wiki in the world they are building an epic story they are building an epic knowledge resource about the world of warcraft okay so these are four superpowers that add up to one thing gamers are super empowered hopeful individuals these are people who believe that they are individually capable of changing the world and the only problem is they believe that they are capable of changing virtual worlds and not the real world that's a problem that i'm trying to solve there's an economist named ever castanova whose work is brilliant he looks at why people are investing so much time and energy and money in online worlds and he says we're witnessing what amounts to know less than a mass exitist to virtual worlds and online game environments and he's an economist so he's rational and he says not like me i'm a game designer i'm exuberant but he says he says that this makes perfect sense because gamers can achieve more in online worlds and they can in real life they can have stronger social relationships in games than they can have in real life they get better feedback and feel more rewarded in games than they do in real life so he says but for now it makes perfect sense for gamers to spend more time in virtual worlds and the real world now i also agree that that is rational for now but it is not by any means an optimal situation we have to start making the real world work more like a game so i take my inspiration from something that happened two thousand five hundred years ago these are ancient dice made out of sheep sneckles right before we had awesome game controllers we had sheep sneckles and these represent the first game equipment designed by human beings and if you're familiar with the work of the ancient greek historian heroists you might know this history which is the history of who invented games and why kardis says that games particularly die games were invented in the kingdom of lydia during a time of famine apparently there was such a severe famine that the king of lydia decided they had to do something crazy people were suffering people were fighting it was an extreme situation they needed an extreme solution so according toists they invented dice games and they set up a kingdom wide policy on one day everybody would eat and on the next day everybody would play games and they would be so immersed in playing the dice games because games are so engaging and immerse us and such satisfying blissful productivity they would ignore the fact that they had no food to eat and then on the next day they would play games and on the next day they would eat and according to hardicists
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3659038)[0m everybody talks about happiness these days i had somebody count the number of books with happiness in the title published in the last five years and they gave up after about forty and there were many more and there is a huge wave of interest in happiness among researchers there is a lot of happiness culturing everybody would like to make people happier but in spread of all this flood of work there are several cognitive traps that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight about happiness and my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive traps this applies to lay people thinking about their own happiness and it applies to scholars thinking about happiness because it turns out we're just as messed up as anybody else's the first of these traps are reluctance to admit complexity it turns out that the word happiness is just not a useful word anymore because we applied to too many different things i think there is one particular meaningful to which we might restrict it but by and large this is something that we'll have to give up and we'll have to adopt a more complicated view of what well being is the second trap is a confusion between experience and memory basically it's between being happy in your life and being happy about your life so happy with your life and those are two very different concepts and they're both lumped in the notion of happiness and the third is it's the focusing illusion and it's the unfortunate fact that we can't think about any circumstance that affects will be without distorting it's important i mean this is a real cognitive prop there's just no way of getting it right now i'd like to start with an example of somebody with a question an answer session after one of my lectures and reported a story and that was a story he said he had been listening to a symphony and it was absolutely glorious music and at the very end of the recording there was a dreadful screeching sound and then he added really quite emotionally and it drew in the whole experience but it happened when it had ruined with the memory of the experience he had had the experience he had had twenty minutes of glorious music they counted for nothing because he was left with the memory the memory was ruined and the memory was all that he had gotten keep what this is telling us really is that we might be thinking of ourselves and other people in terms of two cells there is an experiencing self who lives in the present and knows the present it's capable of re living the past but basically it has only the present it's the experiencing self that the doctor approaches you know when the doctor does it hurt now when i thought you hear and then there is a remembering self and the remembering self is the one that keeps score and maintains the story of our life and it's the one that the doctor approaches in asking the question how have you been feeling lately how is your trip torbania or something like that those are two very different entities the experiencing self and the remembering self and getting confused between them is part of the mess about the notion of happiness now the remembering self is a storyteller and that really starts with a basic a response of our memory it starts immediately we don't only tell stories when we set out to tell stories our memory tells our stories that is what we get to keep from our experiences is a story and let me begin with one example this is an old study those are actual patients undergoing a painful procedure i won't go into detail it's no longer painful these days but it was painful when they when the study was run in the nineteen nineties there is a report on their pain every sixty seconds and here are two patients those are their recordings and you are ask who of them suffered more and it's a very easy question i mean clearly patient be suffered more it's clonoscopy was longer and every a minute of pain that patient a had patient b had and more but now there's another question how much did these patients think they suffer and here is a surprise and the surprise is that patient a had a much worse memory of the clonoscopy the patient b the stories of the clonoscopies were different and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends and neither these stories is very inspiring or great but one of them is distinct but one of them is distinctly worse than the other and the one that is worse is the one where pain was that it speaks at the very end it's a bad story how do we know that because we asked these people after their colonoscopy and much later too how bad was the whole thing in total and it was much worse for aid than for me in memory now this is a direct conflict between the experiencing self and the remembering self from the point of view the experiencing self clearly be at a worst time now what you could do with patient aid and we actually ran clinical experiments and it has been done and it does work you could actually extend the monoscopy of patient aid by just keeping the tubin without driggling it too much that will that will cause the patient to suffer but just a little and much less than before and if you do that for a couple of minutes you have made the experiencing self of patient a will sof and you've made the remembering self of patient a lot better off because now you have a doubt patient a with a better story about his experience what defines a story and that is true of the stories that memory delivers for us and it's also true of the stories that we make up what finds a story changes significant moments and endings endings are very very important and in this case you know the ending dominated now the experiencing self lives its life continuously has moments of experience one after the other and you can ask what happens to these moments and the answer is really straightforward they are lost forever i mean most of the moments of our life when i calculated you know the psychological present is said to be about three seconds long that means that you know in a life there are about six hundred million of them in a month there are about six hundred thousand but most of them don't leave the trace most of them are completely ignored by the remembering self and yet somehow you get the sense that they should count that what happens during these moments of experience is our life it's the finite resource that we are spending where we are on the earth and how to spend it would seem to be relevant but that is not the story that our remembering self keeps for us so we have remembering self and the experiencing self and they're really quite distinct the biggest difference between them is in the handing of time from the point of view of the experiencing self if you have a vacation and the second week is just as good as the first then the two week vacation is twice as good as the one week vacation that's not the way it works at all for the remembering self for the remembering self the two week vacation is barely better than the one week vacation because there are no new memories added you have not changed the story and in this way time is actually the critical variable that distinguishes a remembering self from our experiencing self time has very little impact on the story now the remembering self does more than remember and tell stories it is actually the one that makes decisions because if you have a patient who has had say two clonoscopes with two different surgeons and is deciding which for them to choose then but the one that chooses the one that has the memory that is less bad and that's the surgery that would be chosen and the experiencing self has no voice in this choice we actually don't choose between experiences we choose between memories of experiences and even when we think about the future we don't think of our future normally as experiences we think of our future as anticipated memories and basically you can look at the tyrony of the remembering self and you can think of the remembering self sort of dragging the experiencing self through experiences that the experiencing self doesn't mean i have that sense that when we go on locations this is very frequently the case that is that it's we go on vacations to a very large extent in the service of our remembering self and this is a bit how to justify a thing i mean how much do we consume our memories that is one of the explanations that has given for the dominance of the remembering self and when i think about that i think about a vocation we had an antctic a few years ago which was clearly the vestification of the heart and i think of it ratibly often relative to how much i think of other vacations and i'd probably have consumed my memories of that three week trip i would say for about twenty five minutes in the last four years now you know if i had ever opened the folder with the six hundred pictures in it i would have spent another hour now that is three weeks and that is that most an hour and a half there seems to be a discrepancy now i may be a bit extreme in how little appetite i have for consuming memories but even if you do more of those there is a genuine question why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences so i want you to think about a thought experiment imagine that for your next vacation you know that at the end of the vacation all your pictures will be destroyed and you'll get an amusic bug so that you won't remember anything now would you choose the same vacation if you would choose a different vacation there is a conflict between your two cells and you need to think about how to dunicate the conflict and it's actually not at all obvious because if you think in terms of time then you get one answer and if you think in terms of memories you might get another answer why do we pick them the locations we do is a problem that confronts us you know with a choice between the two cells now the two cells bring up two notions of happiness there are really two concepts of happiness that we can apply one per self and so you can ask how happy as the experiencing self and then you would ask how happy are the moments in the experiencing self life and there are happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process what are the emotions that can be measured and by the way now we are capable of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experiencing self over time if you ask for the happiness of the remembering self it's a completely different thing this is not about how happy a person lives it is about how satisfied or please the person is when that person thinks about her life very different notions anyone who doesn't distinguish those notions is going to miss up the study of happiness and i belong to a crowd of students a well being who've been missing up the study of happiness for a long time in precisely this way the distinction between the happiness of the experiencing self and the satisfaction of the remembering self has been recognized in recent years and there are now efforts to measure the two separately the gallop organization as a world poll with more than half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about their experiences and there have been other efforts along those lines so in recent years we have begun to learn about the happiness of the two cells and the main lesson i think that we have learned is that they're really different you can know how satisfied somebody is with their life and that really doesn't teach you much about how happily they're living their life and twice those you know just to give you a sense of the correlation the correlation is zero point five what that means is if you met somebody and you were told his father is six feet tall how much would you know about his height well you would know something about this height but there's a lot of uncertainty you have that much uncertainty if i tell you that somebody rank their life ate on a scale of ten you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy they are with their experiencing self so the correlation is low we know something about what controls satisfaction of the happiness self we know that money is very important goals are very important we know that happiness is mainly being satisfied with people that we like spending time with people that we like there are other pleasures that this is dominant so if you want to maximize the happiness of the two cells you are going to end up doing very different things the bottom line of what i said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a substitute for well being it is a completely different notion now very quickly another reason we cannot think straight about happiness is that

simple question of how happy people are in california you are not going to get to the correct answer when you ask that question you think people must be happier in california if you say you live in ohio and and what happens is when you think about living in california you are thinking of the contrast between california and other places and that contrast says in climate well it turns out that climate is not very important to the experiencing self and it's not even very important to the reflective self that decides how happy people are

memories and basically you can look at the tyrony of the remembering self and you can think of the remembering self sort of dragging the experiencing self through experiences that the experiencing self doesn't mean i have that sense that when we go on locations this is very frequently the case that is that it's we go on vacations to a very large extent in the service of our remembering self and this is a bit how to justify a thing i mean how much do we consume our memories that is one of the explanations that has given for the dominance of the remembering self and when i think about that i think about a vocation we had an antctic a few years ago which was clearly the vestification of the heart and i think of it ratibly often relative to how much i think of other vacations and i'd probably have consumed my memories of that three week trip i would say for about twenty five minutes in the last four years now you know if i had ever opened the folder with the six hundred pictures in it i would have spent another hour now that is three weeks and that is that most an hour and a half there seems to be a discrepancy now i may be a bit extreme in how little appetite i have for consuming memories but even if you do more of those there is a genuine question why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences so i want you to think about a thought experiment imagine that for your next vacation you know that at the end of the vacation all your pictures will be destroyed and you'll get an amusic bug so that you won't remember anything now would you choose the same vacation if you would choose a different vacation there is a conflict between your two cells and you need to think about how to dunicate the conflict and it's actually not at all obvious because if you think in terms of time then you get one answer and if you think in terms of memories you might get another answer why do we pick them the locations we do is a problem that confronts us you know with a choice between the two cells now the two cells bring up two notions of happiness there are really two concepts of happiness that we can apply one per self and so you can ask how happy as the experiencing self and then you would ask how happy are the moments in the experiencing self life and there are happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process what are the emotions that can be measured and by the way now we are capable of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experiencing self over time if you ask for the happiness of the remembering self it's a completely different thing this is not about how happy a person lives it is about how satisfied or please the person is when that person thinks about her life very different notions anyone who doesn't distinguish those notions is going to miss up the study of happiness and i belong to a crowd of students a well being who've been missing up the study of happiness for a long time in precisely this way the distinction between the happiness of the experiencing self and the satisfaction of the remembering self has been recognized in recent years and there are now efforts to measure the two separately the gallop organization as a world poll with more than half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about their experiences and there have been other efforts along those lines so in recent years we have begun to learn about the happiness of the two cells and the main lesson i think that we have learned is that they're really different you can know how satisfied somebody is with their life and that really doesn't teach you much about how happily they're living their life and twice those you know just to give you a sense of the correlation the correlation is zero point five what that means is if you met somebody and you were told his father is six feet tall how much would you know about his height well you would know something about this height but there's a lot of uncertainty you have that much uncertainty if i tell you that somebody rank their life ate on a scale of ten you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy they are with their experiencing self so the correlation is low we know something about what controls satisfaction of the happiness self we know that money is very important goals are very important we know that happiness is mainly being satisfied with people that we like spending time with people that we like there are other pleasures that this is dominant so if you want to maximize the happiness of the two cells you are going to end up doing very different things the bottom line of what i said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a substitute for well being it is a completely different notion now very quickly another reason we cannot think straight about happiness is that we do not attend to the same things when we think about life and we actually live so if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in california you are not going to get to the correct answer when you ask that question you think people must be happier in california if you say you live in ohio and and what happens is when you think about living in california you are thinking of the contrast between california and other places and that contrast says in climate well it turns out that climate is not very important to the experiencing self and it's not even very important to the reflective self that decides how happy people are but now because the reflective self is in charge you may end up some people may end up moving to california and it's sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen to people who move to california and the hope of getting happier well the experiencing self is not going to get happier we know that but one thing will happen they will think they are happier
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3659038)[0m everybody talks about happiness these days i had somebody count the number of books with happiness in the title published in the last five years and they gave up after about forty and there were many more and there is a huge wave of interest in happiness among researchers there is a lot of happiness culturing everybody would like to make people happier but in spread of all this flood of work there are several cognitive traps that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight about happiness and my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive traps this applies to lay people thinking about their own happiness and it applies to scholars thinking about happiness because it turns out we're just as messed up as anybody else's the first of these traps are reluctance to admit complexity it turns out that the word happiness is just not a useful word anymore because we applied to too many different things i think there is one particular meaningful to which we might restrict it but by and large this is something that we'll have to give up and we'll have to adopt a more complicated view of what well being is the second trap is a confusion between experience and memory basically it's between being happy in your life and being happy about your life so happy with your life and those are two very different concepts and they're both lumped in the notion of happiness and the third is it's the focusing illusion and it's the unfortunate fact that we can't think about any circumstance that affects will be without distorting it's important i mean this is a real cognitive prop there's just no way of getting it right now i'd like to start with an example of somebody with a question an answer session after one of my lectures and reported a story and that was a story he said he had been listening to a symphony and it was absolutely glorious music and at the very end of the recording there was a dreadful screeching sound and then he added really quite emotionally and it drew in the whole experience but it happened when it had ruined with the memory of the experience he had had the experience he had had twenty minutes of glorious music they counted for nothing because he was left with the memory the memory was ruined and the memory was all that he had gotten keep what this is telling us really is that we might be thinking of ourselves and other people in terms of two cells there is an experiencing self who lives in the present and knows the present it's capable of re living the past but basically it has only the present it's the experiencing self that the doctor approaches you know when the doctor does it hurt now when i thought you hear and then there is a remembering self and the remembering self is the one that keeps score and maintains the story of our life and it's the one that the doctor approaches in asking the question how have you been feeling lately how is your trip torbania or something like that those are two very different entities the experiencing self and the remembering self and getting confused between them is part of the mess about the notion of happiness now the remembering self is a storyteller and that really starts with a basic a response of our memory it starts immediately we don't only tell stories when we set out to tell stories our memory tells our stories that is what we get to keep from our experiences is a story and let me begin with one example this is an old study those are actual patients undergoing a painful procedure i won't go into detail it's no longer painful these days but it was painful when they when the study was run in the nineteen nineties there is a report on their pain every sixty seconds and here are two patients those are their recordings and you are ask who of them suffered more and it's a very easy question i mean clearly patient be suffered more it's clonoscopy was longer and every a minute of pain that patient a had patient b had and more but now there's another question how much did these patients think they suffer and here is a surprise and the surprise is that patient a had a much worse memory of the clonoscopy the patient b the stories of the clonoscopies were different and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends and neither these stories is very inspiring or great but one of them is distinct but one of them is distinctly worse than the other and the one that is worse is the one where pain was that it speaks at the very end it's a bad story how do we know that because we asked these people after their colonoscopy and much later too how bad was the whole thing in total and it was much worse for aid than for me in memory now this is a direct conflict between the experiencing self and the remembering self from the point of view the experiencing self clearly be at a worst time now what you could do with patient aid and we actually ran clinical experiments and it has been done and it does work you could actually extend the monoscopy of patient aid by just keeping the tubin without driggling it too much that will that will cause the patient to suffer but just a little and much less than before and if you do that for a couple of minutes you have made the experiencing self of patient a will sof and you've made the remembering self of patient a lot better off because now you have a doubt patient a with a better story about his experience what defines a story and that is true of the stories that memory delivers for us and it's also true of the stories that we make up what finds a story changes significant moments and endings endings are very very important and in this case you know the ending dominated now the experiencing self lives its life continuously has moments of experience one after the other and you can ask what happens to these moments and the answer is really straightforward they are lost forever i mean most of the moments of our life when i calculated you know the psychological present is said to be about three seconds long that means that you know in a life there are about six hundred million of them in a month there are about six hundred thousand but most of them don't leave the trace most of them are completely ignored by the remembering self and yet somehow you get the sense that they should count that what happens during these moments of experience is our life it's the finite resource that we are spending where we are on the earth and how to spend it would seem to be relevant but that is not the story that our remembering self keeps for us so we have remembering self and the experiencing self and they're really quite distinct the biggest difference between them is in the handing of time from the point of view of the experiencing self if you have a vacation and the second week is just as good as the first then the two week vacation is twice as good as the one week vacation that's not the way it works at all for the remembering self for the remembering self the two week vacation is barely better than the one week vacation because there are no new memories added you have not changed the story and in this way time is actually the critical variable that distinguishes a remembering self from our experiencing self time has very little impact on the story now the remembering self does more than remember and tell stories it is actually the one that makes decisions because if you have a patient who has had say two clonoscopes with two different surgeons and is deciding which for them to choose then but the one that chooses the one that has the memory that is less bad and that's the surgery that would be chosen and the experiencing self has no voice in this choice we actually don't choose between experiences we choose between memories of experiences and even when we think about the future we don't think of our future normally as experiences we think of our future as anticipated

just a little and much less than before and if you do that for a couple of minutes you have made the experiencing self of patient a will sof and you've made the remembering self of patient a lot better off because now you have a doubt patient a with a better story about his experience what defines a story and that is true of the stories that memory delivers for us and it's also true of the stories that we make up what finds a story changes significant moments and endings endings are very very important and in this case you know the ending dominated now the experiencing self lives its life continuously has moments of experience one after the other and you can ask what happens to these moments and the answer is really straightforward they are lost forever i mean most of the moments of our life when i calculated you know the psychological present is said to be about three seconds long that means that you know in a life there are about six hundred million of them in a month there are about six hundred thousand but most of them don't leave the trace most of them are completely ignored by the remembering self and yet somehow you get the sense that they should count that what happens during these moments of experience is our life it's the finite resource that we are spending where we are on the earth and how to spend it would seem to be relevant but that is not the story that our remembering self keeps for us so we have remembering self and the experiencing self and they're really quite distinct the biggest difference between them is in the handing of time from the point of view of the experiencing self if you have a vacation and the second week is just as good as the first then the two week vacation is twice as good as the one week vacation that's not the way it works at all for the remembering self for the remembering self the two week vacation is barely better than the one week vacation because there are no new memories added you have not changed the story and in this way time is actually the critical variable that distinguishes a remembering self from our experiencing self time has very little impact on the story now the remembering self does more than remember and tell stories it is actually the one that makes decisions because if you have a patient who has had say two clonoscopes with two different surgeons and is deciding which for them to choose then but the one that chooses the one that has the memory that is less bad and that's the surgery that would be chosen and the experiencing self has no voice in this choice we actually don't choose between experiences we choose between memories of experiences and even when we think about the future we don't think of our future normally as experiences we think of our future as anticipated memories and basically you can look at the tyrony of the remembering self and you can think of the remembering self sort of dragging the experiencing self through experiences that the experiencing self doesn't mean i have that sense that when we go on locations this is very frequently the case that is that it's we go on vacations to a very large extent in the service of our remembering self and this is a bit how to justify a thing i mean how much do we consume our memories that is one of the explanations that has given for the dominance of the remembering self and when i think about that i think about a vocation we had an antctic a few years ago which was clearly the vestification of the heart and i think of it ratibly often relative to how much i think of other vacations and i'd probably have consumed my memories of that three week trip i would say for about twenty five minutes in the last four years now you know if i had ever opened the folder with the six hundred pictures in it i would have spent another hour now that is three weeks and that is that most an hour and a half there seems to be a discrepancy now i may be a bit extreme in how little appetite i have for consuming memories but even if you do more of those there is a genuine question why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences so i want you to think about a thought experiment imagine that for your next vacation you know that at the end of the vacation all your pictures will be destroyed and you'll get an amusic bug so that you won't remember anything now would you choose the same vacation if you would choose a different vacation there is a conflict between your two cells and you need to think about how to dunicate the conflict and it's actually not at all obvious because if you think in terms of time then you get one answer and if you think in terms of memories you might get another answer why do we pick them the locations we do is a problem that confronts us you know with a choice between the two cells now the two cells bring up two notions of happiness there are really two concepts of happiness that we can apply one per self and so you can ask how happy as the experiencing self and then you would ask how happy are the moments in the experiencing self life and there are happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process what are the emotions that can be measured and by the way now we are capable of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experiencing self over time if you ask for the happiness of the remembering self it's a completely different thing this is not about how happy a person lives it is about how satisfied or please the person is when that person thinks about her life very different notions anyone who doesn't distinguish those notions is going to miss up the study of happiness and i belong to a crowd of students a well being who've been missing up the study of happiness for a long time in precisely this way the distinction between the happiness of the experiencing self and the satisfaction of the remembering self has been recognized in recent years and there are now efforts to measure the two separately the gallop organization as a world poll with more than half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about their experiences and there have been other efforts along those lines so in recent years we have begun to learn about the happiness of the two cells and the main lesson i think that we have learned is that they're really different you can know how satisfied somebody is with their life and that really doesn't teach you much about how happily they're living their life and twice those you know just to give you a sense of the correlation the correlation is zero point five what that means is if you met somebody and you were told his father is six feet tall how much would you know about his height well you would know something about this height but there's a lot of uncertainty you have that much uncertainty if i tell you that somebody rank their life ate on a scale of ten you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy they are with their experiencing self so the correlation is low we know something about what controls satisfaction of the happiness self we know that money is very important goals are very important we know that happiness is mainly being satisfied with people that we like spending time with people that we like there are other pleasures that this is dominant so if you want to maximize the happiness of the two cells you are going to end up doing very different things the bottom line of what i said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a substitute for well being it is a completely different notion now very quickly another reason we cannot think straight about happiness is that we do not attend to the same things when we think about life and we actually live so if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in california you are not going to get to the correct answer when you ask that question you think people must be happier in california if you say you live in ohio and and what happens is when you think about living in california you are thinking of the contrast between california and other places and that contrast says in climate well it turns out that climate is not very important to the experiencing self and it's not even very important to the reflective self that decides how happy people are but now because the reflective self is in charge you may end up some people may end up moving to california and it's sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen to people who move to california and the hope of getting happier well the experiencing self is not going to get happier we know that but one thing will happen they will think they are happier because when they think about it they'll be reminded of how horrible the weather was in ohio and they will feel they made the right decision it is very difficult to think straight about well being and i hope i have given you a sense of how difficult it is thank you thank you thank you thank you so much now when we were on the phone a few weeks ago you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result came out of that galop survey is something that you can share since you do have a few moments left now
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3659036)[0m i'm going to talk today about energy and climate and that might seem a bit surprising because my full time work of the foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds about the things that we need to invent and deliver to help the poorest two billion live better lives but energy and climate are extremely important to these people in fact more important than to anyone else on the planet the climate getting worse means that many years their crops won't grow there'll be too much rain not enough rain things will change in ways that their fragile environment simply can't support and that leads to starvation it leads to uncertainty it leads to unrest so that the climate changes will be terrible for them also the price of energy is very important to them in fact if you could pick just one thing the lower the price up to reduce poverty by far you would pick energy now the price of energy has come down over time really advanced civilization is based on advances in energy the coal revolution fueled the industrial revolution in the nineteen hundreds we've seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity and that's why we have refrigerators air conditioning we can make modern materials and do so many things and so we're in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world but as we make it cheaper and let's say let's go for making it twice as cheap we need to meet a new constraint and that constraint has to do with co two co two is warming the planet and the equation on co two is actually a very straightforward one if you sum up the co two that gets submitted that leads to a temperature increase and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects the effects on the weather perhaps worse the indirect effects in the natural ecosystems can't adjust to these rapid changes and so you get ecosystem collapses now the exact amount of how you map from a certain increase of co two to what temperature will be and where the positive feedbacks are there's some uncertainty there but not very much and there's certainly uncertainty about how bad those effects will be but they will be extremely bad i asked the top scientists and the several times do we really have to get down to near zero can't we just cut it in half a quarter and the answer is that until we get near to zero the temperature will continue to rise and so that's a big challenge it's very different than saying you know we're a twelve foot high truck trying to get under a ten foot bridge and we can just sort of squeeze under this is something that has to get to zero now we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year over twenty six billion tons for each american it's about twenty tons for people in poor countries it's less than one ton it's an average about five tons for everyone on the planet and somehow we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero it's been constantly going up it's only various economic changes that have even flattened at all so we have to go from rapidly rising to falling and falling all the way to zero this equation has four factors a little bit of multiplication so you've got a thing on the left co two that you want to get to zero and that's going to be based on the number of people the services each person juicy on average the energy on average for each service and the co two being put out a per unit of energy so let's look at each one of these and see how we can get this out into zero probably one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero that's back from high school algebra let's take a look first we've got population the world today has six point eight billion people that's headed up to about nine billion now if we do a really great job on new vaccines healthcare reproductive health services we could lower that by perhaps ten or fifteen percent but there we see an increase of about one point three the second factor is the services we use this encompasses everything the food we clothing tv heating these are very good things getting rid of poverty means providing these services to almost everyone on the planet and it's a great thing for this number to go up in the rich world perhaps the top one billion we probably could cut back and use less but every year this number on average is going to go up and so overall that will more than double the services delivered per person here we have a very basic service do you have lighting in your house to be able to read your homework and then in fact these kids don't so they're going out and reading their schoolwork under the street laps and now efficiency the energy for each service here finally we have some good news we have something that's not going up through various inventions and new ways of doing lighting through different types of cars different ways of building buildings there are a lot of services where you can bring the energy for that service down quite substantially some individual services even bring it down by ninety percent there are other services like how we make fertilizes or how we do our transport where the rooms for improvement are far far less and so overall here if we're optimistic we may get a reduction of a factor of three to even perhaps a factor of sex but for these first three factors now we've gone from twenty six billion to its best maybe thirteen billion tons and that just won't cut it so let's look at this fourth factor there's going to be a key one and this is the amount of co two put out for each unit of energy and so the question is can you actually get that to zero if you burn coal no if you burn natural gas almost every way we make electricity today except for the emerging renewables and nuclear puts out co two and so what we're going to have to do at a global scale is create a new system and so we need energy miracles now when i use the term miracle i don't mean something that's impossible the microprocessors a miracle the personal computers a miracle the internet and services are a miracle so the people here have participated in the creation of many miracles usually we don't have a deadline where you have to get the miracle by a certain date usually just kind of stand by and some come along some don't this is a case where we actually have to drive a full speed and get a miracle in a pretty tight timeline now i thought how could i really capture this is there's some kind of natural illustration some demonstration that would grab people's imagination here i thought back to a year ago when i brought mosquitoes and somehow people enjoyed that it really got them involved in the idea of you know there are people who lived in mosquitoes so with energy i like to come up with is this i decided that releasing fireflies would be my contribution to the environment here this year so here we have some natural fly flies i'm told they don't bite in fact they might even not even leave that jar now there's all sorts of geeky solutions like that one but they don't really add up too much we need solutions either one or several that have unbelievable scale and unbelievable reliability and although there's many directions of people seeking i really only see five that can achieve the big numbers i've left out time geothermal fusion biopules those may make some contribution and if they can do better than i expect so much the better but my key point here is that we're going to have to work on each of these five and we can't give up any of them because they look daunting because they all that have significant challenges let's look first at the burning fossil fuels either burning coal or burning natural gas what you need to do there it seems like it might be simple but it's not and that's to take all the co two after you burn it going out the flu pressurize it create a liquid put it somewhere and hope it stays there now we have some pilot things that do this at the sixty to eighty percent level but getting up to that full percentage that will be very tricky and a green on where these co two quantity should be put will be hard but the toughest one here is this long term issue who's going to be sure who's going to guarantee something that is literally billions of times larger than any type of waste you think of in terms of nuclear other things this is a lot of volume so that's the top one next would be nuclear it also has three big problems cost particularly in highly regulated countries is high the issue of the safety really feeling good about nothing can go wrong that even though you have these human operators that the fuel it doesn't get used for weapons and then what do you do with the waste although it's not very large there are a lot of concerns about that people need to feel good about it so three very tough problems that might be solvable and so should be worked on the last three of the five i've grouped together these are what people often refer to as the renewable sources and they actually although it's great they don't require fuel they have some disadvantages one is that the density of energy gather in these technologies is dramatically less than a power plant this is energy farming so you're talking about many square miles thousands of times more area than you think of as a normal energy plant also these are interment and sources the sun doesn't shine all day it doesn't shine every day and likewise the wind doesn't blow all the time and so you depend on these sources you have to have some way of getting energy during those time periods that it's not available so we've got big cost challenges here we have transmission challenges for example say this energy sources outside your country you not only need the technology but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from elsewhere and finally this storage problem and dimensionalized this i went through and looked at all the types of batteries that get made for cars for computers for phones for flashlights for everything and compared that to the amount of electrical energy the world uses and what i found is that all the batteries we make now could store less than ten minutes of all the energy and so in fact we need a big breakthrough here something that's going to be a factor of one hundred better than the approaches we have now it's not impossible but it's not a very easy thing now this shows up when you try to get the internet source to be above say twenty to thirty percent of what you're using if you're counting on it for one hundred percent you need an incredible miracle battery now how we're going to go forward on this what's the right approach is that a banhattan project what's the thing that can get us there well we need lots of companies working on this hundreds in each of these five paths we need at least one hundred people and a lot of them you look at and say they're crazy that's good and i think here in the ted group we have many people who are already pursuing this bill gross has several companies and clear one called e solar that has some great solar thermal technology the node colsas investing in dozens of companies that are doing great things and have interesting possibilities and i'm trying to help back that uneither marble than i actually are back in a company that perhaps surprisingly is actually taking the nuclear approach there are some innovations in nuclear modular liquid and innovation really stopped in this industry quite some time ago so the idea that there is some good ideas laying around is not all that surprising the idea of terror power is that instead of burning the part of uranium the one percent is that you two thirty five we decided well let's burn the ninety nine percent the u two thirty eight it is kind of a crazy idea in fact people have talked about it for a long time but they could never simulate properly whether it would work or not and so it threw the advent of modern supercomputers that now you can simulate and see that yes with the right materials approach this looks like it would work because you're bringing that ninety nine percent you have greatly improved cost profile you actually burn up the waste and you can actually use this fuel all the left over waste from today's reactors and so instead of worrying about them you just take that it's a great thing it breeds this uranium as it goes along so it's kind of like the candle you can see it's a log there often referred to as a traveling wave reactor in terms of fuel this really solves the problem i've got a picture here of a place in kentucky this is the left over of the ninety nine percent where they've taken out the part they are now so it's called depleted uranium that would power the u s for hundreds of years and simply by filtering seawater in an inexpensive process you'd have enough fuel for the entire lifetime of the rest of the planet so you know it's got lots lots of challenges i had but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward so let's think how should we measure ourselves what should our report card look like well let's go out to where we really need to get and then look at the intermediate for two thousand and fifty you've heard many people talk about this eighty percent reduction that really is very important that we get there and that twenty percent will be used up by things going on in poor countries still some agriculture hopefully we will have cleaned up forest cement so to get to that eighty percent the developed countries including countries like china will have had to switch their electric electricity generation all together so the other greatest are we deploying this zero emission technology we deployed in all the developed countries and we're in the process of getting it out elsewhere that's super important that's a key element of making that report card backing up from there what should the twenty twenty report card look like well again it should have the two elements we should go through these efficiency measures to start getting reductions the less we emit the less that some will be of co two and therefore the less the temperature but in some ways the grade we get there doing things that don't get us all the way to the big reductions is only equally or maybe even slightly less important than the other which is the piece of innovation on these breakthroughs these breakthroughs we need to move those at full speed and we can measure that in terms of companies pilot projects regulatory things that have been changed but there's a lot of great books that have been written about this the al gore book our choice and the david makai book sustainable energy without hot air they really go through it and i think can create a framework that this can be discussed broadly because we need broadbacking for this there's a lot that has to come together so this is a wish it's a very concrete wish that we invent this technology if you gave me only one wish for the next fifty years i can pick whose president i can pick a vaccine which is something i love or i could pick that this thing that's half the cost with no co two gets invented this is the wish i would pick this is the one of the greatest impact if we don't get this wish that vision between the people who think short term and long term will be terrible between us and china between poor countries and rich and most of all the lights of those two billion will be far worse so what do we have to do what am i appealing to you to step forward and and drive we need to go from more research funding when countries get together at places like copenhagen nation just discuss the co two they should discuss this innovation agenda and you'd be stunned at the ridiculously low levels of spending
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3659036)[0m RESETTING HISORY
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3659045)[0m i'm game i'm a game designer in making games online now for ten years and my goal for the next decade is to try to make it as easy to save the world in real life as it is to save the world in online games now i have a plan for this and it entails convincing more people including all of you to spend more time playing bigger and better games right now we spend three billion hours a week playing online games some of you might be thinking that's a lot of time to spend playing games maybe too much time considering how many urgent problems we have to solve in the real world but actually according to my research at the institute for the future it's actually the opposite is true three billion hours a week is not nearly enough game play to solve the world's most urgent problems in fact i believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet we need to increase that total dramatically i've calculated the total we need at twenty one billion hours of game play every week so that's probably a bit of a counterintuitive idea so i'll just say it again let it sync in and if we want to solve problems like hunger poverty climate change global conflict obesity with i believe that we need to aspire to play games online for at least twenty one billion hours a week by the end of the next decade now i'm serious i am here's why this picture pretty much sums up why i think games are so essential to the future survival of the human species truly this is a portrait by a photographer named phil told dono he wanted to capture the emotion of gaming so we set up a camera in front of gamers while they were playing and this is a classic gaming emotion now if you're not a gamer you might miss some of the nuance in this photo you probably see the sense of urgency a little bit of but fear but intense concentration deep deep focus on tackling a really difficult problem if you are a gamer you will notice a few nuances here the crinkle of the eyes up and around the mouth is the sign of optimism and the highbrls up is surprised this is a gamer who's on the verge of something called an epic wind no well you heard of that okay good so we have some gamers among us so an epic win is an outcome that is so extraordinarily positive you had no idea it was even possible until you achieved it it was almost beyond the threshold of imagination and when you get there you're shocked to discover what you're truly capable of that's an epic win this is a gamer on the verge of an ethic win and this is the face that we need to see on millions of problem solvers all over the world as we try to tackle the obstacles of the next century the face of someone who against all odds is on the verge of an epic win now unfortunately this is more of the face that we see in everyday life now as we try to tackle urgent problems this is what i call the i'm not good at life face and this is actually me making it can you see it yes good this is actually me making the i'm not good at life face this is a piece of graffiti in my old neighborhood in berkeley california where i did my phd on why we're better in games than we are in real life and this is a problem that a lot of gamers have we feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games and i don't mean just good as in successful although it's part of it we do achieve more in game worlds but i also mean good as in motivated to do something that matters inspired to collaborate and to cooperate when we're in game worlds i believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves the most likely to help at a moment notice the most likely to stick with a problem as long as it takes to get up after failure and try again and in real life when we face failure when we confront obstacles we often don't feel that way we feel overcome we feel overwhelmed we feel anxious may be depressed frustrated or cynical we never have this feelings from we're playing games they just don't exist in games so that's what i wanted to study when i was a graduate student what about games makes it impossible to feel that we can't achieve everything how can we take those feelings from games and apply them to real world work so i looked at games like world of warcraft which is really the ideal collaborative problem solving environment and i started to notice a few things that make epequins so possible in allline worlds so the first thing is whenever you show up in one of these allline games especially in world of worecraft there are lots and lots of different characters who are willing to trust you with a world saving mission right away but not just any mission it's a mission that is perfectly matched with your current level in the game right so you can do it they never give you a challenge that you can't achieve but it is on the verge of what you're capable of so you have to try hard but there's no unemployment in world of warcraft there's no sitting around bringing your hands there is always something specific and important to be done and there are also tons of collaborators everywhere you go hundreds of thousands of people ready to work with you to achieve your epic mission that's not something we have in real life that easily the sense that at our fingertips are tons of collaborators and also this epic story this inspiring story of why were there and what we're doing and then we get all this positive feedback you guys have heard of leveling up and plus one strength plus ones intelligence we don't get the kind of constant feedback in real life when i get off the stage i'm not going to have plus one speaking and plus one crazy idea plus twenty crazy idea i don't get that feedback in real life now the problem with collaborative online environments like world of warcraft is that it's so satisfying to be on the verge of an epic one all the time that we decide to spend all our time in these game worlds it's just better than reality so so far collectively all the road of warcraft gamers have spent five point nine three million years solving the virtual problems of asora now that's not necessarily a bad thing it might sound like it's a bad thing but to put that in context five point nine three million years ago was when our earliest primate human ancestors stood up that was the first upright primate ok so when we talk about how much time we're currently investing in playing games the only way it makes sense to even think about it is to talk about time at the magnitude of human evolution which is an extraordinary thing but it's also act because it turns out that by spending all this time playing games we're actually changing what we are capable of as human beings we're evolving to be more collaborative and hardy species this is true i believe this so consider this really interesting statistic i was recently published by a researcher at carnegie mellon university the average young person today in a country with a strong gamer culture will have spent ten thousand hours playing online games by the age of twenty one now ten thousand hours is a really interesting number for two reasons first of all for children in the united states ten thousand and eighty hours is the exact amount of time you will spend in school from fifth grade to high school graduation if you have perfect attendance we have an entire parallel track of education going on where young people are learning as much about what it takes to be a good gamer as they're learning about everything else in school but some of you have probably read malcolm gladwell's new book outliers so you would have heard of his theory of success the ten thousand hour theory of success it's based on this great cognitive science research that if we can master ten thousand hours of effortful study at anything by the age of twenty one we will be virtuoso that it will be as good at whatever we do as the greatest people in the world and so now what we're looking at is an entire generation of young people who are virtuoso gamers so the big question is what exactly our gamer is getting so good at because if we could figure that out we would have a virtually unprecedented human resource on our hands this is how many people we have in the world who spend at least an hour a day playing online games these are virtuoso gamers five hundred million people who are extraordinarily good at something and in the next decade we're going to have another billion gamers who are extraordinarily good at whatever that is if you don't know it already this is coming the game industry is developing consols that are low energy and that work with the wireless phone networks instead of broadband internet so that gamers all over the world particularly in india that china brazil can get online they expect one billion more gamers in the next decade so it brings up to one point five billion gamers so i started to think about what these games are making us virtuous as a here are the four things i came up with the first is urgent optimism okay think of this as extreme self motivation urgent optimism is the desire to act immediately to tackle an obstacle combined with the belief that we have a reasonable hope of success but gamers always believe that an epic one is possible i mean it is always worth trying and trying now game results around gamers are virtuosos at weaving a tight social fabric there's a lot of interesting research that shows that we like people better after we play a game with them even if they beaten us badly the reason is it takes a lot of trust to play a game with someone we trust that they will spend their time with us that they will play by the same rules value the same goal they'll stay with the game until it's over and so playing a game together actually builds up bonds and trust and cooperation and we actually build stronger social relationships as a result blissful productivity i love it you know there's a reason why the average world of warcraft gamer plays for twenty two hours a week kind of a half time job it's because we know when we're playing a game that we're actually happier working hard than we are but relaxing or hanging out we know that we are optimized as human beings to do hard meaningful work and gamers are willing to work hard all the time if they're given the right work finally epic meaning and gamers love to be attached to inspiring missions to human planetary scale stories so just one bit of trivia that helps put that into perspective so you all know wikipedia the biggest wiki in the world second biggest wiki in the world with nearly eighty thousand articles is the world of warcraft wiki five million people use it every month they have compiled more information about world of warcraft on the internet than any other topic covered on any other wiki in the world they are building an epic story they are building an epic knowledge resource about the world of warcraft okay so these are four superpowers that add up to one thing gamers are super empowered hopeful individuals these are people who believe that they are individually capable of changing the world and the only problem is they believe that they are capable of changing virtual worlds and not the real world that's a problem that i'm trying to solve there's an economist named ever castanova whose work is brilliant he looks at why people are investing so much time and energy and money in online worlds and he says we're witnessing what amounts to know less than a mass exitist to virtual worlds and online game environments and he's an economist so he's rational and he says not like me i'm a game designer i'm exuberant but he says he says that this makes perfect sense because gamers can achieve more in online worlds and they can in real life they can have stronger social relationships in games than they can have in real life they get better feedback and feel more rewarded in games than they do in real life so he says but for now it makes perfect sense for gamers to spend more time in virtual worlds and the real world now i also agree that that is rational for now but it is not by any means an optimal situation we have to start making the real world work more like a game so i take my inspiration from something that happened two thousand five hundred years ago these are ancient dice made out of sheep sneckles right before we had awesome game controllers we had sheep sneckles and these represent the first game equipment designed by human beings and if you're familiar with the work of the ancient greek historian heroists you might know this history which is the history of who invented games and why kardis says that games particularly die games were invented in the kingdom of lydia during a time of famine apparently there was such a severe famine that the king of lydia decided they had to do something crazy people were suffering people were fighting it was an extreme situation they needed an extreme solution so according toists they invented dice games and they set up a kingdom wide policy on one day everybody would eat and on the next day everybody would play games and they would be so immersed in playing the dice games because games are so engaging and immerse us and such satisfying blissful productivity they would ignore the fact that they had no food to eat and then on the next day they would play games and on the next day they would eat and according to hardicists they passed eighteen years this way surviving they were famine by eating home one day and playing games on the next now this is exactly i think how we're using games today we're using games to escape real world suffering we're using games to get away from everything that's broken in the real environment everything that's not satisfying about real life and we're getting what we need from games but it doesn't have to end there this is really exciting according to harditists after eighteen years the famine wasn't getting better so the king decided they would play one final by game they divided the entire kingdom in half they played one dice game and the winners of that game got to go but on a big adventure they would leave lydia and they would go out and search of a new place to live leaving behind just enough people to survive on the resources that were available and hopefully to take the civilization somewhere else where they could drive now this sounds crazy right but recently dna evidence has shown that the etruscans who then led to the roman empire actually share the same dna as the ancient ladens and so but recently scientists have suggested that herdicus is crazy story is actually true and geologists have found evidence of a global cooling that lasted for nearly twenty years that could have explained the famine so this crazy story might be true they might have actually save their culture by playing games escaping to games eighteen years and then been so inspired and knew so much about how to come together with games that they actually save the entire civilization that way okay we can do that we've been playing warcrast since nineteen ninety four that was the first real time strategy game from the world of warcrast series that was sixteen years ago they play dice games for eighteen years we've been playing work off for sixteen years i say we are ready for our own epic game now they had half the civilization go off in search of a new world so that's where i get my twenty one billion hours a week of game play from let's get half of us to agree to spend an hour a day playing games until we solve real world problems now i know you're asking how are we going to solve rural problems in games well that's what i have devoted my work to over the past few years at the institute for the future we have this manner in our offices in palo alto and it expresses our view of how we should try to relate to the future we do not want to try to predict the future what we want to do is make the future we want to imagine the best case scenario outcome and then we want to empower people to make that outcome in reality we want to imagine epic wins and then give people to means to achieve the epic win i'm just going to very briefly show you three games that i've made that are an attempt to give people the means to create epic wins in their own futures so this is world without oil we made this game in two thousand and seven this is an online game in which you try to survive an oil shortage
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3659038)[0m everybody talks about happiness these days i had somebody count the number of books with happiness in the title published in the last five years and they gave up after about forty and there were many more and there is a huge wave of interest in happiness among researchers there is a lot of happiness culturing everybody would like to make people happier but in spread of all this flood of work there are several cognitive traps that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight about happiness and my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive traps this applies to lay people thinking about their own happiness and it applies to scholars thinking about happiness because it turns out we're just as messed up as anybody else's the first of these traps are reluctance to admit complexity it turns out that the word happiness is just not a useful word anymore because we applied to too many different things i think there is one particular meaningful to which we might restrict it but by and large this is something that we'll have to give up and we'll have to adopt a more complicated view of what well being is the second trap is a confusion between experience and memory basically it's between being happy in your life and being happy about your life so happy with your life and those are two very different concepts and they're both lumped in the notion of happiness and the third is it's the focusing illusion and it's the unfortunate fact that we can't think about any circumstance that affects will be without distorting it's important i mean this is a real cognitive prop there's just no way of getting it right now i'd like to start with an example of somebody with a question an answer session after one of my lectures and reported a story and that was a story he said he had been listening to a symphony and it was absolutely glorious music and at the very end of the recording there was a dreadful screeching sound and then he added really quite emotionally and it drew in the whole experience but it happened when it had ruined with the memory of the experience he had had the experience he had had twenty minutes of glorious music they counted for nothing because he was left with the memory the memory was ruined and the memory was all that he had gotten keep what this is telling us really is that we might be thinking of ourselves and other people in terms of two cells there is an experiencing self who lives in the present and knows the present it's capable of re living the past but basically it has only the present it's the experiencing self that the doctor approaches you know when the doctor does it hurt now when i thought you hear and then there is a remembering self and the remembering self is the one that keeps score and maintains the story of our life and it's the one that the doctor approaches in asking the question how have you been feeling lately how is your trip torbania or something like that those are two very different entities the experiencing self and the remembering self and getting confused between them is part of the mess about the notion of happiness now the remembering self is a storyteller and that really starts with a basic a response of our memory it starts immediately we don't only tell stories when we set out to tell stories our memory tells our stories that is what we get to keep from our experiences is a story and let me begin with one example this is an old study those are actual patients undergoing a painful procedure i won't go into detail it's no longer painful these days but it was painful when they when the study was run in the nineteen nineties there is a report on their pain every sixty seconds and here are two patients those are their recordings and you are ask who of them suffered more and it's a very easy question i mean clearly patient be suffered more it's clonoscopy was longer and every a minute of pain that patient a had patient b had and more but now there's another question how much did these patients think they suffer and here is a surprise and the surprise is that patient a had a much worse memory of the clonoscopy the patient b the stories of the clonoscopies were different and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends and neither these stories is very inspiring or great but one of them is distinct but one of them is distinctly worse than the other and the one that is worse is the one where pain was that it speaks at the very end it's a bad story how do we know that because we asked these people after their colonoscopy and much later too how bad was the whole thing in total and it was much worse for aid than for me in memory now this is a direct conflict between the experiencing self and the remembering self from the point of view the experiencing self clearly be at a worst time now what you could do with patient aid and we actually ran clinical experiments and it has been done and it does work you could actually extend the monoscopy of patient aid by just keeping the tubin without driggling it too much that will that will cause the patient to suffer but just a little and much less than before and if you do that for a couple of minutes you have made the experiencing self of patient a will sof and you've made the remembering self of patient a lot better off because now you have a doubt patient a with a better story about his experience what defines a story and that is true of the stories that memory delivers for us and it's also true of the stories that we make up what finds a story changes significant moments and endings endings are very very important and in this case you know the ending dominated now the experiencing self lives its life continuously has moments of experience one after the other and you can ask what happens to these moments and the answer is really straightforward they are lost forever i mean most of the moments of our life when i calculated you know the psychological present is said to be about three seconds long that means that you know in a life there are about six hundred million of them in a month there are about six hundred thousand but most of them don't leave the trace most of them are completely ignored by the remembering self and yet somehow you get the sense that they should count that what happens during these moments of experience is our life it's the finite resource that we are spending where we are on the earth and how to spend it would seem to be relevant but that is not the story that our remembering self keeps for us so we have remembering self and the experiencing self and they're really quite distinct the biggest difference between them is in the handing of time from the point of view of the experiencing self if you have a vacation and the second week is just as good as the first then the two week vacation is twice as good as the one week vacation that's not the way it works at all for the remembering self for the remembering self the two week vacation is barely better than the one week vacation because there are no new memories added you have not changed the story and in this way time is actually the critical variable that distinguishes a remembering self from our experiencing self time has very little impact on the story now the remembering self does more than remember and tell stories it is actually the one that makes decisions because if you have a patient who has had say two clonoscopes with two different surgeons and is deciding which for them to choose then but the one that chooses the one that has the memory that is less bad and that's the surgery that would be chosen and the experiencing self has no voice in this choice we actually don't choose between experiences we choose between memories of experiences and even when we think about the future we don't think of our future normally as experiences we think of our future as anticipated memories and basically you can look at the tyrony of the remembering self and you can think of the remembering self sort of dragging the experiencing self through experiences that the experiencing self doesn't mean i have that sense that when we go on locations this is very frequently the case that is that it's we go on vacations to a very large extent in the service of our remembering self and this is a bit how to justify a thing i mean how much do we consume our memories that is one of the explanations that has given for the dominance of the remembering self and when i think about that i think about a vocation we had an antctic a few years ago which was clearly the vestification of the heart and i think of it ratibly often relative to how much i think of other vacations and i'd probably have consumed my memories of that three week trip i would say for about twenty five minutes in the last four years now you know if i had ever opened the folder with the six hundred pictures in it i would have spent another hour now that is three weeks and that is that most an hour and a half there seems to be a discrepancy now i may be a bit extreme in how little appetite i have for consuming memories but even if you do more of those there is a genuine question why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences so i want you to think about a thought experiment imagine that for your next vacation you know that at the end of the vacation all your pictures will be destroyed and you'll get an amusic bug so that you won't remember anything now would you choose the same vacation if you would choose a different vacation there is a conflict between your two cells and you need to think about how to dunicate the conflict and it's actually not at all obvious because if you think in terms of time then you get one answer and if you think in terms of memories you might get another answer why do we pick them the locations we do is a problem that confronts us you know with a choice between the two cells now the two cells bring up two notions of happiness there are really two concepts of happiness that we can apply one per self and so you can ask how happy as the experiencing self and then you would ask how happy are the moments in the experiencing self life and there are happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process what are the emotions that can be measured and by the way now we are capable of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experiencing self over time if you ask for the happiness of the remembering self it's a completely different thing this is not about how happy a person lives it is about how satisfied or please the person is when that person thinks about her life very different notions anyone who doesn't distinguish those notions is going to miss up the study of happiness and i belong to a crowd of students a well being who've been missing up the study of happiness for a long time in precisely this way the distinction between the happiness of the experiencing self and the satisfaction of the remembering self has been recognized in recent years and there are now efforts to measure the two separately the gallop organization as a world poll with more than half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about their experiences and there have been other efforts along those lines so in recent years we have begun to learn about the happiness of the two cells and the main lesson i think that we have learned is that they're really different you can know how satisfied somebody is with their life and that really doesn't teach you much about how happily they're living their life and twice those you know just to give you a sense of the correlation the correlation is zero point five what that means is if you met somebody and you were told his father is six feet tall how much would you know about his height well you would know something about this height but there's a lot of uncertainty you have that much uncertainty if i tell you that somebody rank their life ate on a scale of ten you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy they are with their experiencing self so the correlation is low we know something about what controls satisfaction of the happiness self we know that money is very important goals are very important we know that happiness is mainly being satisfied with people that we like spending time with people that we like there are other pleasures that this is dominant so if you want to maximize the happiness of the two cells you are going to end up doing very different things the bottom line of what i said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a substitute for well being it is a completely different notion now very quickly another reason we cannot think straight about happiness is that we do not attend to the same things when we think about life and we actually live so if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in california you are not going to get to the correct answer when you ask that question you think people must be happier in california if you say you live in ohio and and what happens is when you think about living in california you are thinking of the contrast between california and other places and that contrast says in climate well it turns out that climate is not very important to the experiencing self and it's not even very important to the reflective self that decides how happy people are but now because the reflective self is in charge you may end up some people may end up moving to california and it's sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen to people who move to california and the hope of getting happier well the experiencing self is not going to get happier we know that but one thing will happen they will think they are happier because when they think about it they'll be reminded of how horrible the weather was in ohio and they will feel they made the right decision it is very difficult to think straight about well being and i hope i have given you a sense of how difficult it is thank you thank you thank you thank you so much now when we were on the phone a few weeks ago you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result came out of that galop survey is something that you can share since you do have a few moments left now sure i think the most interesting result that we found in the gallop service is a number which we absolutely did not expect to find we found that with respect to the happiness of the experiencing self when you know we looked at how in our feelings vary with income and it turns out that below an income of sixty thousand dollars a year for americans and that's a very large sample of americans like six hundred thousand so it's a large representative sample below an income of six hundred thousand dollars a year six fifty thousand sixty thousand sixty thousand sixty thousand dollars a year people are unhappy and they get progressively unhappy the poor they get above that we get an absolutely flat line i mean i've really seen line so flat clearly what is happening is money does not buy you experiential happiness but lack of money certainly buys you misery and we can measure that misery very very clearly in terms of this the other self the remembering self you get a different story the more money you are the more satisfied you are that does not hold for emotion but the whole american endeavor is about life liberty the pursuit of happiness if people took seriously that finding i mean it seems to turn upside down everything we believe about
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3659036)[0m i'm going to talk today about energy and climate and that might seem a bit surprising because my full time work of the foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds about the things that we need to invent and deliver to help the poorest two billion live better lives but energy and climate are extremely important to these people in fact more important than to anyone else on the planet the climate getting worse means that many years their crops won't grow there'll be too much rain not enough rain things will change in ways that their fragile environment simply can't support and that leads to starvation it leads to uncertainty it leads to unrest so that the climate changes will be terrible for them also the price of energy is very important to them in fact if you could pick just one thing the lower the price up to reduce poverty by far you would pick energy now the price of energy has come down over time really advanced civilization is based on advances in energy the coal revolution fueled the industrial revolution in the nineteen hundreds we've seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity and that's why we have refrigerators air conditioning we can make modern materials and do so many things and so we're in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world but as we make it cheaper and let's say let's go for making it twice as cheap we need to meet a new constraint and that constraint has to do with co two co two is warming the planet and the equation on co two is actually a very straightforward one if you sum up the co two that gets submitted that leads to a temperature increase and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects the effects on the weather perhaps worse the indirect effects in the natural ecosystems can't adjust to these rapid changes and so you get ecosystem collapses now the exact amount of how you map from a certain increase of co two to what temperature will be and where the positive feedbacks are there's some uncertainty there but not very much and there's certainly uncertainty about how bad those effects will be but they will be extremely bad i asked the top scientists and the several times do we really have to get down to near zero can't we just cut it in half a quarter and the answer is that until we get near to zero the temperature will continue to rise and so that's a big challenge it's very different than saying you know we're a twelve foot high truck trying to get under a ten foot bridge and we can just sort of squeeze under this is something that has to get to zero now we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year over twenty six billion tons for each american it's about twenty tons for people in poor countries it's less than one ton it's an average about five tons for everyone on the planet and somehow we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero it's been constantly going up it's only various economic changes that have even flattened at all so we have to go from rapidly rising to falling and falling all the way to zero this equation has four factors a little bit of multiplication so you've got a thing on the left co two that you want to get to zero and that's going to be based on the number of people the services each person juicy on average the energy on average for each service and the co two being put out a per unit of energy so let's look at each one of these and see how we can get this out into zero probably one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero that's back from high school algebra let's take a look first we've got population the world today has six point eight billion people that's headed up to about nine billion now if we do a really great job on new vaccines healthcare reproductive health services we could lower that by perhaps ten or fifteen percent but there we see an increase of about one point three the second factor is the services we use this encompasses everything the food we clothing tv heating these are very good things getting rid of poverty means providing these services to almost everyone on the planet and it's a great thing for this number to go up in the rich world perhaps the top one billion we probably could cut back and use less but every year this number on average is going to go up and so overall that will more than double the services delivered per person here we have a very basic service do you have lighting in your house to be able to read your homework and then in fact these kids don't so they're going out and reading their schoolwork under the street laps and now efficiency the energy for each service here finally we have some good news we have something that's not going up through various inventions and new ways of doing lighting through different types of cars different ways of building buildings there are a lot of services where you can bring the energy for that service down quite substantially some individual services even bring it down by ninety percent there are other services like how we make fertilizes or how we do our transport where the rooms for improvement are far far less and so overall here if we're optimistic we may get a reduction of a factor of three to even perhaps a factor of sex but for these first three factors now we've gone from twenty six billion to its best maybe thirteen billion tons and that just won't cut it so let's look at this fourth factor there's going to be a key one and this is the amount of co two put out for each unit of energy and so the question is can you actually get that to zero if you burn coal no if you burn natural gas almost every way we make electricity today except for the emerging renewables and nuclear puts out co two and so what we're going to have to do at a global scale is create a new system and so we need energy miracles now when i use the term miracle i don't mean something that's impossible the microprocessors a miracle the personal computers a miracle the internet and services are a miracle so the people here have participated in the creation of many miracles usually we don't have a deadline where you have to get the miracle by a certain date usually just kind of stand by and some come along some don't this is a case where we actually have to drive a full speed and get a miracle in a pretty tight timeline now i thought how could i really capture this is there's some kind of natural illustration some demonstration that would grab people's imagination here i thought back to a year ago when i brought mosquitoes and somehow people enjoyed that it really got them involved in the idea of you know there are people who lived in mosquitoes so with energy i like to come up with is this i decided that releasing fireflies would be my contribution to the environment here this year so here we have some natural fly flies i'm told they don't bite in fact they might even not even leave that jar now there's all sorts of geeky solutions like that one but they don't really add up too much we need solutions either one or several that have unbelievable scale and unbelievable reliability and although there's many directions of people seeking i really only see five that can achieve the big numbers i've left out time geothermal fusion biopules those may make some contribution and if they can do better than i expect so much the better but my key point here is that we're going to have to work on each of these five and we can't give up any of them because they look daunting because they all that have significant challenges let's look first at the burning fossil fuels either burning coal or burning natural gas what you need to do there it seems like it might be simple but it's not and that's to take all the co two after you burn it going out the flu pressurize it create a liquid put it somewhere and hope it stays there now we have some pilot things that do this at the sixty to eighty percent level but getting up to that full percentage that will be very tricky and a green on where these co two quantity should be put will be hard but the toughest one here is this long term issue who's going to be sure who's going to guarantee something that is literally billions of times larger than any type of waste you think of in terms of nuclear other things this is a lot of volume so that's the top one next would be nuclear it also has three big problems cost particularly in highly regulated countries is high the issue of the safety really feeling good about nothing can go wrong that even though you have these human operators that the fuel it doesn't get used for weapons and then what do you do with the waste although it's not very large there are a lot of concerns about that people need to feel good about it so three very tough problems that might be solvable and so should be worked on the last three of the five i've grouped together these are what people often refer to as the renewable sources and they actually although it's great they don't require fuel they have some disadvantages one is that the density of energy gather in these technologies is dramatically less than a power plant this is energy farming so you're talking about many square miles thousands of times more area than you think of as a normal energy plant also these are interment and sources the sun doesn't shine all day it doesn't shine every day and likewise the wind doesn't blow all the time and so you depend on these sources you have to have some way of getting energy during those time periods that it's not available so we've got big cost challenges here we have transmission challenges for example say this energy sources outside your country you not only need the technology but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from elsewhere and finally this storage problem and dimensionalized this i went through and looked at all the types of batteries that get made for cars for computers for phones for flashlights for everything and compared that to the amount of electrical energy the world uses and what i found is that all the batteries we make now could store less than ten minutes of all the energy and so in fact we need a big breakthrough here something that's going to be a factor of one hundred better than the approaches we have now it's not impossible but it's not a very easy thing now this shows up when you try to get the internet source to be above say twenty to thirty percent of what you're using if you're counting on it for one hundred percent you need an incredible miracle battery now how we're going to go forward on this what's the right approach is that a banhattan project what's the thing that can get us there well we need lots of companies working on this hundreds in each of these five paths we need at least one hundred people and a lot of them you look at and say they're crazy that's good and i think here in the ted group we have many people who are already pursuing this bill gross has several companies and clear one called e solar that has some great solar thermal technology the node colsas investing in dozens of companies that are doing great things and have interesting possibilities and i'm trying to help back that uneither marble than i actually are back in a company that perhaps surprisingly is actually taking the nuclear approach there are some innovations in nuclear modular liquid and innovation really stopped in this industry quite some time ago so the idea that there is some good ideas laying around is not all that surprising the idea of terror power is that instead of burning the part of uranium the one percent is that you two thirty five we decided well let's burn the ninety nine percent the u two thirty eight it is kind of a crazy idea in fact people have talked about it for a long time but they could never simulate properly whether it would work or not and so it threw the advent of modern supercomputers that now you can simulate and see that yes with the right materials approach this looks like it would work because you're bringing that ninety nine percent you have greatly improved cost profile you actually burn up the waste and you can actually use this fuel all the left over waste from today's reactors and so instead of worrying about them you just take that it's a great thing it breeds this uranium as it goes along so it's kind of like the candle you can see it's a log there often referred to as a traveling wave reactor in terms of fuel this really solves the problem i've got a picture here of a place in kentucky this is the left over of the ninety nine percent where they've taken out the part they are now so it's called depleted uranium that would power the u s for hundreds of years and simply by filtering seawater in an inexpensive process you'd have enough fuel for the entire lifetime of the rest of the planet so you know it's got lots lots of challenges i had but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward so let's think how should we measure ourselves what should our report card look like well let's go out to where we really need to get and then look at the intermediate for two thousand and fifty you've heard many people talk about this eighty percent reduction that really is very important that we get there and that twenty percent will be used up by things going on in poor countries still some agriculture hopefully we will have cleaned up forest cement so to get to that eighty percent the developed countries including countries like china will have had to switch their electric electricity generation all together so the other greatest are we deploying this zero emission technology we deployed in all the developed countries and we're in the process of getting it out elsewhere that's super important that's a key element of making that report card backing up from there what should the twenty twenty report card look like well again it should have the two elements we should go through these efficiency measures to start getting reductions the less we emit the less that some will be of co two and therefore the less the temperature but in some ways the grade we get there doing things that don't get us all the way to the big reductions is only equally or maybe even slightly less important than the other which is the piece of innovation on these breakthroughs these breakthroughs we need to move those at full speed and we can measure that in terms of companies pilot projects regulatory things that have been changed but there's a lot of great books that have been written about this the al gore book our choice and the david makai book sustainable energy without hot air they really go through it and i think can create a framework that this can be discussed broadly because we need broadbacking for this there's a lot that has to come together so this is a wish it's a very concrete wish that we invent this technology if you gave me only one wish for the next fifty years i can pick whose president i can pick a vaccine which is something i love or i could pick that this thing that's half the cost with no co two gets invented this is the wish i would pick this is the one of the greatest impact if we don't get this wish that vision between the people who think short term and long term will be terrible between us and china between poor countries and rich and most of all the lights of those two billion will be far worse so what do we have to do what am i appealing to you to step forward and and drive we need to go from more research funding when countries get together at places like copenhagen nation just discuss the co two they should discuss this innovation agenda and you'd be stunned at the ridiculously low levels of spending on these innovative approaches we do need the market incentives co two tacks kept trade something that gets that price signal out there we need to get the message out we need to have this dialogue be a more rational more understandable dialogue including the steps that the government takes this is an important wish but it is one i think we can achieve thank you thank you thank you thank you i understand more about terror power right i mean first of all can you give a sense of what sort of scale of investment this is but to actually do this software by the supercomputer higher all the great scientists which we've done that's only tens of millions and even once we test our materials out up in a russian reactor to make sure that our materials work properly then you'll only be up in hundreds of millions the tough thing is building the pilot reactor
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3659054)[0m i'd like to share with you a discovery that i made a few months ago while writing an article for italian wired i always keep my sars handy never i'm writing anything but i'd already finished editing the peace and i realized that i had never once in my life looked up the word disabled to see what i'd find let me read you the entry disabled additive crippled helpless useless erect it stalled mamed wounded mangled lame mutilated run down worn out weakened impotent castrated paralyzed handicapped senile the crap it laid up done up done for done in cracked up counted out see also hurt useless and weak antony healthy strong capable i was reading this list out loud to a friend at first was laughing it was so ludicrous but i had just gotten passed mangled and my voice broke and i had to stop and collect myself from the emotional shock an impact that the assault from these words unleashed you know of course this is my ragedy old sars i'm thinking this must be an ancient printate right but in fact the printate was the early nineteen eighties when i would have been starting primary school and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as related to the other kids in the world around me and needed to say thank god i wasn't using it the sorus back then i mean from this entry it would seem that i was born into a world that perceived someone like me to have nothing positive whatsoever going for them when in fact today i'm celebrated for the opportunities and adventures my life have prepared so i immediately went to look up to two thousand and nine online edition expecting to find a revision worth noting here's the updated version of this entry unfortunately it's not much better i find the last two words undernear ant noms particularly unsettling hole and hold them so it's not just about the words it's what we believe about people when we name them with these words it's about the values behind the words and how we construct those values our language affects our thinking and how we view the world and how we view other people in fact many ancient societies including the greeks and the romans believed that to utter occurse verbally was so powerful because to say the thing out loud brought it into existence so what reality do we want to call into existence a person who is limited or a person who is empowered by casually doing something a symbol is naming a person a child we might be putting kids and casting shadows on their power wouldn't we want to open doors for them instead one such person who opened doors for me was my child a doctor at the aipant institute in wilmington delaware his name is doctor pizzatelo an italian american whose name apparently was too difficult for most americans to pronounce so he went by doctor p and doctor p always were really colorful booties and had the very perfect disposition to work with children i loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital which the exception of my physical therapy sessions i had to do what seemed like in numerable repetitions of exercises with these thick elastic band different colors you know to help build up my leg muscles and i hated these bands more than anything i hated them had names of them i hated them and you know i was already barging at a five year old child with doctor pe to try to get out of doing these exercises unsuccessfully of course and one day he came in to my session exhaustive and forgiving with these sessions and he said to me wow you are such a strong powerful little girl i think you're going to break one of those bands when you do break it i'm going to give you one hundred bucks now of course this was the simple bloy on doctor pe's part to get me to do the exercise i didn't want to do before the prospect of being the richest five year old in the second floor ward but what he effectively did for me was reshape an awful daily occurrence into a new and promising experience for me and i have to wonder today to what extent his vision and his declaration of me as a strong and powerful little girl shaped my own view of myself as an inherently strong powerful and athletic person well into the future this is an example of how adults and positions of power can ignite the power of a child but in the previous instances of those far century you know our language isn't allowing us to evolve into the reality that we would all want now the possibility of an individual to see themselves is capable our language hasn't caught up with the changes in our society many of which have been brought about by technology certainly for a medical standpoint my legs laser surgery for vision impairment titanium needs and hip replacements for aging bodies that are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities and move beyond the limits that nature imposed on them not to mention social networking platforms allows people to self identify to claim their own descriptions of themselves so they can go alone with global groups of their own choosing so perhaps technology is revealing more clearly to us now what has always been a truth that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest asset the human ability to adapt is an interesting thing because people have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity and i'm going to make an admission this phrase never sat right with me and i always felt an easy trying to answer people's questions about it and i think i'm starting to figure out why implicit in this phrase of overcoming adversity is the idea that success or happiness is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience unscathed or unmarked by the experience as if my successes in life have come about from an ability to side step or circum navigate to presume pitballs of a life with prosthetics or what other people perceive as my disability but in fact we are changed we are marked of course by a challenge whether physically emotionally or both and i'm going to suggest that this is a good thing adversity isn't an obstacle that we need to get around in order to resume living our lives it's part of our life and i tend to think of it like my shadow sometimes i see a lot of it sometimes there's very little but it's always with me and certainly i'm not trying to diminish the impact the weight of a person's struggle there is adversity and challenge in life and it's all very real and relative to every single person but the question isn't whether or not you're going to meet adversity but how you're going to meet it so our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adversity but preparing them to meet it well and we do a service to our kids when we make them feel that they're not equipped to adapt there is an important difference and distinction between the objective medical fact of my being an empathy and the subjective societal opinion of whether or not i'm disabled and truthfully the only real and consistent disability i'd had to confront is the world ever thinking that i could be described by those definitions in our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold hard truth about their medical prognosis or indeed prognosis on the expected quality of their life we have to make sure that we don't put the first brick in a wall that will actually disabled someone perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it it serves to be more disabling to the individual than the pathology itself by not treating the wholeness of a person by not acknowledging their potency we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have we are effectively grading someone's worth to our community so we need to see through the pathology and into the range of human capability and most importantly there's a partnership between those perceived deficiencies and our greatest creative ability so it's not about devaluing or negating these more trying time is something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug but instead to find those opportunities wrapped in the adversity so maybe the idea i want to put out there is not so much overcoming adversity as it is opening ourselves up to it embracing it grappling with it use a restling term maybe even dancing with it and perhaps if we see adversity as natural consistent and useful we're less burdened by the presence of it this year we celebrate the two hundred birthday of charles darwin and it was one hundred and fifty years ago when writing about evolution the darwin illustrated i think a truth about the human character to paraphrase it's not the strongest of the species that survives nor is it the most intelligent that survives it is the one that is most adaptable to change conflict is the genesis of creation from darwin's work amongst others we can recognize that the human ability to survive and flourish is driven by the struggle of the human spirit through conflict into transformation so again transformation adaptation is our greatest human skill and perhaps you know until we're tested we don't know we're made of maybe that's what adversity gives us a sense of self a sense of our own power so we can give ourselves a gift we can re imagine adversity as something more than just tough times and maybe we can see it as change diversity is just a change that we haven't adapted ourselves to yet i think the greatest adversity that we've created for ourselves is this idea of normalcy and who is normal there's no normal there's common there's typical there's no normal and would you want to meet that poor base person if they existed i don't think so if we can change this paradigm from one of to achieving normalcy to want a possibility or potency to be even a little bit more dangerous we can release the power of so many more children and invite them to engage they're rare and valuable abilities with the community anthropologists tell us that the one thing we as humans have always required of our community members is to be use to be able to contribute there's evidence that neanderthals sixty thousand years ago carried their elderly and those with serious physical injury and perhaps it's because the life experience of survival of these people proved a value to the community they didn't view these people as broken and useless they were seen as rare and valuable a few years ago i was in a food market in the town where i grew up in that red zone in northeastern pennsylvania and i was standing over a bushel of tomato it was summertime i had shorts on i heard this guy his voice behind me say well if it isn't amy moans and i turn around and this is older man i have no idea who he is and i said i'm sorry sorry i don't have we met i don't remember meeting you he said well you wouldn't remember meeting me i mean when we met i was delivering you from your mother's wom oh that guy and of course actually it did click this man was doctor keam a man that i'd only known about my mother's stories of that day because of course a typical fashion i arrived late from my birthday by two weeks and so my mother's prenatal physician had gone invitation so the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents and because i was born without the cula bones and had feet turned in and a few toes in this foot and a few toes in that he had to be the bear the stranger had to be the bearer of bad news he said to me i had to give this prognosis to your parents that you would never walk and you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids have or any kind of life independence and you've been making a liar amy ever since the extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved newspaper clipping through my whole childhood whether winning a second grade spelling being marching with the girl scouts the hollow trade winning my college scholarship or any of my sports victories and he was using it and integrating it into teaching resident students med students from harman medical school and hers medical school and he called this part of the course the x factor the potential of the human will no prognosis can account for how powerful this could be as a determinant and the quality of someone's life and doctor king went on to tell me that he said in my experience unless repeatedly told otherwise and even it's given a modicum of support it's left to their own devices a child will achieve doctor king made that shift in thinking he understood that there's a difference between the medical condition and what someone might do with it and there's been a shift in my thinking over time and that if you had asked me i'm fifteen years old if i would have traded prosthetics for flesh and bone legs i wouldn't have hesitated for a second i aspired to that kind of normal sea back to then if you asked me today i'm not so sure and it's because of the experiences i've had with them not in spite of the experiences i've had with them and perhaps the shift in me has happened because i've been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me than those who have put lids and cash shadows on me all you really need is one person to show you the epiphany of your own power and your off if you can hand somebody the key to their own power the human spirit is so recepted if you can do that and open a door for someone at a crucial moment you are educating them in the best sense you're teaching them to open doors for themselves in fact the exact meaning of the word educate it comes from the root word induce it means to bring forth what is within to bring out potential so again which potential do we want to bring out there was a case study done in the nineteen sixties britain when they were moving from grammar schools to comprehensive schools called the streaming trials we call it tracking here in the states separating students from a b c d and so on and you know the students get the top of curriculum the best teachers etc well they took over a three month period de level students gave them as told them they were as told them they were bright and at the end of this three month period that they were performing at a level and of course the heartbreaking flip side of the study is that they took the a students and told them they were des and that's what happened at the end of that three month period those who were still around in school besides the dropped people had dropped out this is the crucial part of this case study was that the teachers were duped to the teachers didn't know a switch had been made they were simply told these are the students these are the students and that's how they went about teaching them and treating them so i think at the only true disability is a crushed spirit a spirit that's been crushed doesn't have hope it doesn't see beauty it no longer has our natural childlike curiosity and our innate ability to imagine if instead we can bothster a human spirit to keep hope to see beauty in themselves and others to be curious and imaginative then we are truly using our power well when a spirit has those qualities we are able to create new realities and new ways of being i'd like to leave you with a poem by a fourteenth century persian poet named hopes
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3659036)[0m i'm going to talk today about energy and climate and that might seem a bit surprising because my full time work of the foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds about the things that we need to invent and deliver to help the poorest two billion live better lives but energy and climate are extremely important to these people in fact more important than to anyone else on the planet the climate getting worse means that many years their crops won't grow there'll be too much rain not enough rain things will change in ways that their fragile environment simply can't support and that leads to starvation it leads to uncertainty it leads to unrest so that the climate changes will be terrible for them also the price of energy is very important to them in fact if you could pick just one thing the lower the price up to reduce poverty by far you would pick energy now the price of energy has come down over time really advanced civilization is based on advances in energy the coal revolution fueled the industrial revolution in the nineteen hundreds we've seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity and that's why we have refrigerators air conditioning we can make modern materials and do so many things and so we're in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world but as we make it cheaper and let's say let's go for making it twice as cheap we need to meet a new constraint and that constraint has to do with co two co two is warming the planet and the equation on co two is actually a very straightforward one if you sum up the co two that gets submitted that leads to a temperature increase and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects the effects on the weather perhaps worse the indirect effects in the natural ecosystems can't adjust to these rapid changes and so you get ecosystem collapses now the exact amount of how you map from a certain increase of co two to what temperature will be and where the positive feedbacks are there's some uncertainty there but not very much and there's certainly uncertainty about how bad those effects will be but they will be extremely bad i asked the top scientists and the several times do we really have to get down to near zero can't we just cut it in half a quarter and the answer is that until we get near to zero the temperature will continue to rise and so that's a big challenge it's very different than saying you know we're a twelve foot high truck trying to get under a ten foot bridge and we can just sort of squeeze under this is something that has to get to zero now we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year over twenty six billion tons for each american it's about twenty tons for people in poor countries it's less than one ton it's an average about five tons for everyone on the planet and somehow we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero it's been constantly going up it's only various economic changes that have even flattened at all so we have to go from rapidly rising to falling and falling all the way to zero this equation has four factors a little bit of multiplication so you've got a thing on the left co two that you want to get to zero and that's going to be based on the number of people the services each person juicy on average the energy on average for each service and the co two being put out a per unit of energy so let's look at each one of these and see how we can get this out into zero probably one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero that's back from high school algebra let's take a look first we've got population the world today has six point eight billion people that's headed up to about nine billion now if we do a really great job on new vaccines healthcare reproductive health services we could lower that by perhaps ten or fifteen percent but there we see an increase of about one point three the second factor is the services we use this encompasses everything the food we clothing tv heating these are very good things getting rid of poverty means providing these services to almost everyone on the planet and it's a great thing for this number to go up in the rich world perhaps the top one billion we probably could cut back and use less but every year this number on average is going to go up and so overall that will more than double the services delivered per person here we have a very basic service do you have lighting in your house to be able to read your homework and then in fact these kids don't so they're going out and reading their schoolwork under the street laps and now efficiency the energy for each service here finally we have some good news we have something that's not going up through various inventions and new ways of doing lighting through different types of cars different ways of building buildings there are a lot of services where you can bring the energy for that service down quite substantially some individual services even bring it down by ninety percent there are other services like how we make fertilizes or how we do our transport where the rooms for improvement are far far less and so overall here if we're optimistic we may get a reduction of a factor of three to even perhaps a factor of sex but for these first three factors now we've gone from twenty six billion to its best maybe thirteen billion tons and that just won't cut it so let's look at this fourth factor there's going to be a key one and this is the amount of co two put out for each unit of energy and so the question is can you actually get that to zero if you burn coal no if you burn natural gas almost every way we make electricity today except for the emerging renewables and nuclear puts out co two and so what we're going to have to do at a global scale is create a new system and so we need energy miracles now when i use the term miracle i don't mean something that's impossible the microprocessors a miracle the personal computers a miracle the internet and services are a miracle so the people here have participated in the creation of many miracles usually we don't have a deadline where you have to get the miracle by a certain date usually just kind of stand by and some come along some don't this is a case where we actually have to drive a full speed and get a miracle in a pretty tight timeline now i thought how could i really capture this is there's some kind of natural illustration some demonstration that would grab people's imagination here i thought back to a year ago when i brought mosquitoes and somehow people enjoyed that it really got them involved in the idea of you know there are people who lived in mosquitoes so with energy i like to come up with is this i decided that releasing fireflies would be my contribution to the environment here this year so here we have some natural fly flies i'm told they don't bite in fact they might even not even leave that jar now there's all sorts of geeky solutions like that one but they don't really add up too much we need solutions either one or several that have unbelievable scale and unbelievable reliability and although there's many directions of people seeking i really only see five that can achieve the big numbers i've left out time geothermal fusion biopules those may make some contribution and if they can do better than i expect so much the better but my key point here is that we're going to have to work on each of these five and we can't give up any of them because they look daunting because they all that have significant challenges let's look first at the burning fossil fuels either burning coal or burning natural gas what you need to do there it seems like it might be simple but it's not and that's to take all the co two after you burn it going out the flu pressurize it create a liquid put it somewhere and hope it stays there now we have some pilot things that do this at the sixty to eighty percent level but getting up to that full percentage that will be very tricky and a green on where these co two quantity should be put will be hard but the toughest one here is this long term issue who's going to be sure who's going to guarantee something that is literally billions of times larger than any type of waste you think of in terms of nuclear other things this is a lot of volume so that's the top one next would be nuclear it also has three big problems cost particularly in highly regulated countries is high the issue of the safety really feeling good about nothing can go wrong that even though you have these human operators that the fuel it doesn't get used for weapons and then what do you do with the waste although it's not very large there are a lot of concerns about that people need to feel good about it so three very tough problems that might be solvable and so should be worked on the last three of the five i've grouped together these are what people often refer to as the renewable sources and they actually although it's great they don't require fuel they have some disadvantages one is that the density of energy gather in these technologies is dramatically less than a power plant this is energy farming so you're talking about many square miles thousands of times more area than you think of as a normal energy plant also these are interment and sources the sun doesn't shine all day it doesn't shine every day and likewise the wind doesn't blow all the time and so you depend on these sources you have to have some way of getting energy during those time periods that it's not available so we've got big cost challenges here we have transmission challenges for example say this energy sources outside your country you not only need the technology but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from elsewhere and finally this storage problem and dimensionalized this i went through and looked at all the types of batteries that get made for cars for computers for phones for flashlights for everything and compared that to the amount of electrical energy the world uses and what i found is that all the batteries we make now could store less than ten minutes of all the energy and so in fact we need a big breakthrough here something that's going to be a factor of one hundred better than the approaches we have now it's not impossible but it's not a very easy thing now this shows up when you try to get the internet source to be above say twenty to thirty percent of what you're using if you're counting on it for one hundred percent you need an incredible miracle battery now how we're going to go forward on this what's the right approach is that a banhattan project what's the thing that can get us there well we need lots of companies working on this hundreds in each of these five paths we need at least one hundred people and a lot of them you look at and say they're crazy that's good and i think here in the ted group we have many people who are already pursuing this bill gross has several companies and clear one called e solar that has some great solar thermal technology the node colsas investing in dozens of companies that are doing great things and have interesting possibilities and i'm trying to help back that uneither marble than i actually are back in a company that perhaps surprisingly is actually taking the nuclear approach there are some innovations in nuclear modular liquid and innovation really stopped in this industry quite some time ago so the idea that there is some good ideas laying around is not all that surprising the idea of terror power is that instead of burning the part of uranium the one percent is that you two thirty five we decided well let's burn the ninety nine percent the u two thirty eight it is kind of a crazy idea in fact people have talked about it for a long time but they could never simulate properly whether it would work or not and so it threw the advent of modern supercomputers that now you can simulate and see that yes with the right materials approach this looks like it would work because you're bringing that ninety nine percent you have greatly improved cost profile you actually burn up the waste and you can actually use this fuel all the left over waste from today's reactors and so instead of worrying about them you just take that it's a great thing it breeds this uranium as it goes along so it's kind of like the candle you can see it's a log there often referred to as a traveling wave reactor in terms of fuel this really solves the problem i've got a picture here of a place in kentucky this is the left over of the ninety nine percent where they've taken out the part they are now so it's called depleted uranium that would power the u s for hundreds of years and simply by filtering seawater in an inexpensive process you'd have enough fuel for the entire lifetime of the rest of the planet so you know it's got lots lots of challenges i had but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward so let's think how should we measure ourselves what should our report card look like well let's go out to where we really need to get and then look at the intermediate for two thousand and fifty you've heard many people talk about this eighty percent reduction that really is very important that we get there and that twenty percent will be used up by things going on in poor countries still some agriculture hopefully we will have cleaned up forest cement so to get to that eighty percent the developed countries including countries like china will have had to switch their electric electricity generation all together so the other greatest are we deploying this zero emission technology we deployed in all the developed countries and we're in the process of getting it out elsewhere that's super important that's a key element of making that report card backing up from there what should the twenty twenty report card look like well again it should have the two elements we should go through these efficiency measures to start getting reductions the less we emit the less that some will be of co two and therefore the less the temperature but in some ways the grade we get there doing things that don't get us all the way to the big reductions is only equally or maybe even slightly less important than the other which is the piece of innovation on these breakthroughs these breakthroughs we need to move those at full speed and we can measure that in terms of companies pilot projects regulatory things that have been changed but there's a lot of great books that have been written about this the al gore book our choice and the david makai book sustainable energy without hot air they really go through it and i think can create a framework that this can be discussed broadly because we need broadbacking for this there's a lot that has to come together so this is a wish it's a very concrete wish that we invent this technology if you gave me only one wish for the next fifty years i can pick whose president i can pick a vaccine which is something i love or i could pick that this thing that's half the cost with no co two gets invented this is the wish i would pick this is the one of the greatest impact if we don't get this wish that vision between the people who think short term and long term will be terrible between us and china between poor countries and rich and most of all the lights of those two billion will be far worse so what do we have to do what am i appealing to you to step forward and and drive we need to go from more research funding when countries get together at places like copenhagen nation just discuss the co two they should discuss this innovation agenda and you'd be stunned at the ridiculously low levels of spending on these innovative approaches we do need the market incentives co two tacks kept trade something that gets that price signal out there we need to get the message out we need to have this dialogue be a more rational more understandable dialogue including the steps that the government takes this is an important wish but it is one i think we can achieve thank you thank you thank you thank you i understand more about terror power right i mean first of all can you give a sense of what sort of scale of investment this is but to actually do this software by the supercomputer higher all the great scientists which we've done that's only tens of millions and even once we test our materials out up in a russian reactor to make sure that our materials work properly then you'll only be up in hundreds of millions the tough thing is building the pilot reactor finding the several billion finding the regulator the location that will actually build the first one of these once you get the first one built if it works as advertising then it's just clear as day because the economics the energy density are so different than nuclear as we know

getting energy during those time periods that it's not available so we've got big cost challenges here we have transmission challenges for example say this energy sources outside your country you not only need the technology but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from elsewhere and finally this storage problem and dimensionalized this i went through and looked at all the types of batteries that get made for cars for computers for phones for flashlights for everything and compared that to the amount of electrical energy the world uses and what i found is that all the batteries we make now could store less than ten minutes of all the energy and so in fact we need a big breakthrough here something that's going to be a factor of one hundred better than the approaches we have now it's not impossible but it's not a very easy thing now this shows up when you try to get the internet source to be above say twenty to thirty percent of what you're using if you're counting on it for one hundred percent you need an incredible miracle battery now how we're going to go forward on this what's the right approach is that a banhattan project what's the thing that can get us there well we need lots of companies working on this hundreds in each of these five paths we need at least one hundred people and a lot of them you look at and say they're crazy that's good and i think here in the ted group we have many people who are already pursuing this bill gross has several companies and clear one called e solar that has some great solar thermal technology the node colsas investing in dozens of companies that are doing great things and have interesting possibilities and i'm trying to help back that uneither marble than i actually are back in a company that perhaps surprisingly is actually taking the nuclear approach there are some innovations in nuclear modular liquid and innovation really stopped in this industry quite some time ago so the idea that there is some good ideas laying around is not all that surprising the idea of terror power is that instead of burning the part of uranium the one percent is that you two thirty five we decided well let's burn the ninety nine percent the u two thirty eight it is kind of a crazy idea in fact people have talked about it for a long time but they could never simulate properly whether it would work or not and so it threw the advent of modern supercomputers that now you can simulate and see that yes with the right materials approach this looks like it would work because you're bringing that ninety nine percent you have greatly improved cost profile you actually burn up the waste and you can actually use this fuel all the left over waste from today's reactors and so instead of worrying about them you just take that it's a great thing it breeds this uranium as it goes along so it's kind of like the candle you can see it's a log there often referred to as a traveling wave reactor in terms of fuel this really solves the problem i've got a picture here of a place in kentucky this is the left over of the ninety nine percent where they've taken out the part they are now so it's called depleted uranium that would power the u s for hundreds of years and simply by filtering seawater in an inexpensive process you'd have enough fuel for the entire lifetime of the rest of the planet so you know it's got lots lots of challenges i had but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward so let's think how should we measure ourselves what should our report card look like well let's go out to where we really need to get and then look at the intermediate for two thousand and fifty you've heard many people talk about this eighty percent reduction that really is very important that we get there and that twenty percent will be used up by things going on in poor countries still some agriculture hopefully we will have cleaned up forest cement so to get to that eighty percent the developed countries including countries like china will have had to switch their electric electricity generation all together so the other greatest are we deploying this zero emission technology we deployed in all the developed countries and we're in the process of getting it out elsewhere that's super important that's a key element of making that report card backing up from there what should the twenty twenty report card look like well again it should have the two elements we should go through these efficiency measures to start getting reductions the less we emit the less that some will be of co two and therefore the less the temperature but in some ways the grade we get there doing things that don't get us all the way to the big reductions is only equally or maybe even slightly less important than the other which is the piece of innovation on these breakthroughs these breakthroughs we need to move those at full speed and we can measure that in terms of companies pilot projects regulatory things that have been changed but there's a lot of great books that have been written about this the al gore book our choice and the david makai book sustainable energy without hot air they really go through it and i think can create a framework that this can be discussed broadly because we need broadbacking for this there's a lot that has to come together so this is a wish it's a very concrete wish that we invent this technology if you gave me only one wish for the next fifty years i can pick whose president i can pick a vaccine which is something i love or i could pick that this thing that's half the cost with no co two gets invented this is the wish i would pick this is the one of the greatest impact if we don't get this wish that vision between the people who think short term and long term will be terrible between us and china between poor countries and rich and most of all the lights of those two billion will be far worse so what do we have to do what am i appealing to you to step forward and and drive we need to go from more research funding when countries get together at places like copenhagen nation just discuss the co two they should discuss this innovation agenda and you'd be stunned at the ridiculously low levels of spending on these innovative approaches we do need the market incentives co two tacks kept trade something that gets that price signal out there we need to get the message out we need to have this dialogue be a more rational more understandable dialogue including the steps that the government takes this is an important wish but it is one i think we can achieve thank you thank you thank you thank you i understand more about terror power right i mean first of all can you give a sense of what sort of scale of investment this is but to actually do this software by the supercomputer higher all the great scientists which we've done that's only tens of millions and even once we test our materials out up in a russian reactor to make sure that our materials work properly then you'll only be up in hundreds of millions the tough thing is building the pilot reactor finding the several billion finding the regulator the location that will actually build the first one of these once you get the first one built if it works as advertising then it's just clear as day because the economics the energy density are so different than nuclear as we know and so to understand it right this involves building deep into the ground almost like like a vertical kind of column of nuclear fuel of this sort of spent uranium and then the process starts at the top and works down that's right today you're always refueling the reactors you have lots of people and lots of controls that can go wrong that thing where you're opening it up and moving things in and out that's that's not good so if you have very very cheap fuel then you can put sixty years in just think of it as a log put it down and not have those same complexities and it just sits there and burns for the sixty years and then it's done it's a nuclear power plant that is its own waste disposal solution
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3659038)[0m everybody talks about happiness these days i had somebody count the number of books with happiness in the title published in the last five years and they gave up after about forty and there were many more and there is a huge wave of interest in happiness among researchers there is a lot of happiness culturing everybody would like to make people happier but in spread of all this flood of work there are several cognitive traps that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight about happiness and my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive traps this applies to lay people thinking about their own happiness and it applies to scholars thinking about happiness because it turns out we're just as messed up as anybody else's the first of these traps are reluctance to admit complexity it turns out that the word happiness is just not a useful word anymore because we applied to too many different things i think there is one particular meaningful to which we might restrict it but by and large this is something that we'll have to give up and we'll have to adopt a more complicated view of what well being is the second trap is a confusion between experience and memory basically it's between being happy in your life and being happy about your life so happy with your life and those are two very different concepts and they're both lumped in the notion of happiness and the third is it's the focusing illusion and it's the unfortunate fact that we can't think about any circumstance that affects will be without distorting it's important i mean this is a real cognitive prop there's just no way of getting it right now i'd like to start with an example of somebody with a question an answer session after one of my lectures and reported a story and that was a story he said he had been listening to a symphony and it was absolutely glorious music and at the very end of the recording there was a dreadful screeching sound and then he added really quite emotionally and it drew in the whole experience but it happened when it had ruined with the memory of the experience he had had the experience he had had twenty minutes of glorious music they counted for nothing because he was left with the memory the memory was ruined and the memory was all that he had gotten keep what this is telling us really is that we might be thinking of ourselves and other people in terms of two cells there is an experiencing self who lives in the present and knows the present it's capable of re living the past but basically it has only the present it's the experiencing self that the doctor approaches you know when the doctor does it hurt now when i thought you hear and then there is a remembering self and the remembering self is the one that keeps score and maintains the story of our life and it's the one that the doctor approaches in asking the question how have you been feeling lately how is your trip torbania or something like that those are two very different entities the experiencing self and the remembering self and getting confused between them is part of the mess about the notion of happiness now the remembering self is a storyteller and that really starts with a basic a response of our memory it starts immediately we don't only tell stories when we set out to tell stories our memory tells our stories that is what we get to keep from our experiences is a story and let me begin with one example this is an old study those are actual patients undergoing a painful procedure i won't go into detail it's no longer painful these days but it was painful when they when the study was run in the nineteen nineties there is a report on their pain every sixty seconds and here are two patients those are their recordings and you are ask who of them suffered more and it's a very easy question i mean clearly patient be suffered more it's clonoscopy was longer and every a minute of pain that patient a had patient b had and more but now there's another question how much did these patients think they suffer and here is a surprise and the surprise is that patient a had a much worse memory of the clonoscopy the patient b the stories of the clonoscopies were different and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends and neither these stories is very inspiring or great but one of them is distinct but one of them is distinctly worse than the other and the one that is worse is the one where pain was that it speaks at the very end it's a bad story how do we know that because we asked these people after their colonoscopy and much later too how bad was the whole thing in total and it was much worse for aid than for me in memory now this is a direct conflict between the experiencing self and the remembering self from the point of view the experiencing self clearly be at a worst time now what you could do with patient aid and we actually ran clinical experiments and it has been done and it does work you could actually extend the monoscopy of patient aid by just keeping the tubin without driggling it too much that will that will cause the patient to suffer but just a little and much less than before and if you do that for a couple of minutes you have made the experiencing self of patient a will sof and you've made the remembering self of patient a lot better off because now you have a doubt patient a with a better story about his experience what defines a story and that is true of the stories that memory delivers for us and it's also true of the stories that we make up what finds a story changes significant moments and endings endings are very very important and in this case you know the ending dominated now the experiencing self lives its life continuously has moments of experience one after the other and you can ask what happens to these moments and the answer is really straightforward they are lost forever i mean most of the moments of our life when i calculated you know the psychological present is said to be about three seconds long that means that you know in a life there are about six hundred million of them in a month there are about six hundred thousand but most of them don't leave the trace most of them are completely ignored by the remembering self and yet somehow you get the sense that they should count that what happens during these moments of experience is our life it's the finite resource that we are spending where we are on the earth and how to spend it would seem to be relevant but that is not the story that our remembering self keeps for us so we have remembering self and the experiencing self and they're really quite distinct the biggest difference between them is in the handing of time from the point of view of the experiencing self if you have a vacation and the second week is just as good as the first then the two week vacation is twice as good as the one week vacation that's not the way it works at all for the remembering self for the remembering self the two week vacation is barely better than the one week vacation because there are no new memories added you have not changed the story and in this way time is actually the critical variable that distinguishes a remembering self from our experiencing self time has very little impact on the story now the remembering self does more than remember and tell stories it is actually the one that makes decisions because if you have a patient who has had say two clonoscopes with two different surgeons and is deciding which for them to choose then but the one that chooses the one that has the memory that is less bad and that's the surgery that would be chosen and the experiencing self has no voice in this choice we actually don't choose between experiences we choose between memories of experiences and even when we think about the future we don't think of our future normally as experiences we think of our future as anticipated memories and basically you can look at the tyrony of the remembering self and you can think of the remembering self sort of dragging the experiencing self through experiences that the experiencing self doesn't mean i have that sense that when we go on locations this is very frequently the case that is that it's we go on vacations to a very large extent in the service of our remembering self and this is a bit how to justify a thing i mean how much do we consume our memories that is one of the explanations that has given for the dominance of the remembering self and when i think about that i think about a vocation we had an antctic a few years ago which was clearly the vestification of the heart and i think of it ratibly often relative to how much i think of other vacations and i'd probably have consumed my memories of that three week trip i would say for about twenty five minutes in the last four years now you know if i had ever opened the folder with the six hundred pictures in it i would have spent another hour now that is three weeks and that is that most an hour and a half there seems to be a discrepancy now i may be a bit extreme in how little appetite i have for consuming memories but even if you do more of those there is a genuine question why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences so i want you to think about a thought experiment imagine that for your next vacation you know that at the end of the vacation all your pictures will be destroyed and you'll get an amusic bug so that you won't remember anything now would you choose the same vacation if you would choose a different vacation there is a conflict between your two cells and you need to think about how to dunicate the conflict and it's actually not at all obvious because if you think in terms of time then you get one answer and if you think in terms of memories you might get another answer why do we pick them the locations we do is a problem that confronts us you know with a choice between the two cells now the two cells bring up two notions of happiness there are really two concepts of happiness that we can apply one per self and so you can ask how happy as the experiencing self and then you would ask how happy are the moments in the experiencing self life and there are happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process what are the emotions that can be measured and by the way now we are capable of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experiencing self over time if you ask for the happiness of the remembering self it's a completely different thing this is not about how happy a person lives it is about how satisfied or please the person is when that person thinks about her life very different notions anyone who doesn't distinguish those notions is going to miss up the study of happiness and i belong to a crowd of students a well being who've been missing up the study of happiness for a long time in precisely this way the distinction between the happiness of the experiencing self and the satisfaction of the remembering self has been recognized in recent years and there are now efforts to measure the two separately the gallop organization as a world poll with more than half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about their experiences and there have been other efforts along those lines so in recent years we have begun to learn about the happiness of the two cells and the main lesson i think that we have learned is that they're really different you can know how satisfied somebody is with their life and that really doesn't teach you much about how happily they're living their life and twice those you know just to give you a sense of the correlation the correlation is zero point five what that means is if you met somebody and you were told his father is six feet tall how much would you know about his height well you would know something about this height but there's a lot of uncertainty you have that much uncertainty if i tell you that somebody rank their life ate on a scale of ten you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy they are with their experiencing self so the correlation is low we know something about what controls satisfaction of the happiness self we know that money is very important goals are very important we know that happiness is mainly being satisfied with people that we like spending time with people that we like there are other pleasures that this is dominant so if you want to maximize the happiness of the two cells you are going to end up doing very different things the bottom line of what i said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a substitute for well being it is a completely different notion now very quickly another reason we cannot think straight about happiness is that we do not attend to the same things when we think about life and we actually live so if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in california you are not going to get to the correct answer when you ask that question you think people must be happier in california if you say you live in ohio and and what happens is when you think about living in california you are thinking of the contrast between california and other places and that contrast says in climate well it turns out that climate is not very important to the experiencing self and it's not even very important to the reflective self that decides how happy people are but now because the reflective self is in charge you may end up some people may end up moving to california and it's sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen to people who move to california and the hope of getting happier well the experiencing self is not going to get happier we know that but one thing will happen they will think they are happier because when they think about it they'll be reminded of how horrible the weather was in ohio and they will feel they made the right decision it is very difficult to think straight about well being and i hope i have given you a sense of how difficult it is thank you thank you thank you thank you so much now when we were on the phone a few weeks ago you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result came out of that galop survey is something that you can share since you do have a few moments left now sure i think the most interesting result that we found in the gallop service is a number which we absolutely did not expect to find we found that with respect to the happiness of the experiencing self when you know we looked at how in our feelings vary with income and it turns out that below an income of sixty thousand dollars a year for americans and that's a very large sample of americans like six hundred thousand so it's a large representative sample below an income of six hundred thousand dollars a year six fifty thousand sixty thousand sixty thousand sixty thousand dollars a year people are unhappy and they get progressively unhappy the poor they get above that we get an absolutely flat line i mean i've really seen line so flat clearly what is happening is money does not buy you experiential happiness but lack of money certainly buys you misery and we can measure that misery very very clearly in terms of this the other self the remembering self you get a different story the more money you are the more satisfied you are that does not hold for emotion but the whole american endeavor is about life liberty the pursuit of happiness if people took seriously that finding i mean it seems to turn upside down everything we believe about you know for example taxation policy and so forth there is a really chance that politicians the country generally would take a finding like that seriously and public policy based on it you know i think that there is recognition of the role of happiness researching public policy the recognition is going to be slow in the united states no question about that but in the u k it is happening in other countries it is happening people are recognizing that they ought to be thinking of policy when of happiness when they think of public policy it's going to take a world and it's not going to and people are going to debate whether they want to study experience happiness or whether they want to study life evaluation so we need to have that debate fairly soon how to enhance happiness goes very different ways depending on how you think of whether you think of the remembering self where you think of the experiencing self this is going to influence policy i think in years to come in the united states efforts are being made to measure the experience happiness of the population this is going to be i think within the next decade or two part of national statistics
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3659045)[0m i'm game i'm a game designer in making games online now for ten years and my goal for the next decade is to try to make it as easy to save the world in real life as it is to save the world in online games now i have a plan for this and it entails convincing more people including all of you to spend more time playing bigger and better games right now we spend three billion hours a week playing online games some of you might be thinking that's a lot of time to spend playing games maybe too much time considering how many urgent problems we have to solve in the real world but actually according to my research at the institute for the future it's actually the opposite is true three billion hours a week is not nearly enough game play to solve the world's most urgent problems in fact i believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet we need to increase that total dramatically i've calculated the total we need at twenty one billion hours of game play every week so that's probably a bit of a counterintuitive idea so i'll just say it again let it sync in and if we want to solve problems like hunger poverty climate change global conflict obesity with i believe that we need to aspire to play games online for at least twenty one billion hours a week by the end of the next decade now i'm serious i am here's why this picture pretty much sums up why i think games are so essential to the future survival of the human species truly this is a portrait by a photographer named phil told dono he wanted to capture the emotion of gaming so we set up a camera in front of gamers while they were playing and this is a classic gaming emotion now if you're not a gamer you might miss some of the nuance in this photo you probably see the sense of urgency a little bit of but fear but intense concentration deep deep focus on tackling a really difficult problem if you are a gamer you will notice a few nuances here the crinkle of the eyes up and around the mouth is the sign of optimism and the highbrls up is surprised this is a gamer who's on the verge of something called an epic wind no well you heard of that okay good so we have some gamers among us so an epic win is an outcome that is so extraordinarily positive you had no idea it was even possible until you achieved it it was almost beyond the threshold of imagination and when you get there you're shocked to discover what you're truly capable of that's an epic win this is a gamer on the verge of an ethic win and this is the face that we need to see on millions of problem solvers all over the world as we try to tackle the obstacles of the next century the face of someone who against all odds is on the verge of an epic win now unfortunately this is more of the face that we see in everyday life now as we try to tackle urgent problems this is what i call the i'm not good at life face and this is actually me making it can you see it yes good this is actually me making the i'm not good at life face this is a piece of graffiti in my old neighborhood in berkeley california where i did my phd on why we're better in games than we are in real life and this is a problem that a lot of gamers have we feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games and i don't mean just good as in successful although it's part of it we do achieve more in game worlds but i also mean good as in motivated to do something that matters inspired to collaborate and to cooperate when we're in game worlds i believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves the most likely to help at a moment notice the most likely to stick with a problem as long as it takes to get up after failure and try again and in real life when we face failure when we confront obstacles we often don't feel that way we feel overcome we feel overwhelmed we feel anxious may be depressed frustrated or cynical we never have this feelings from we're playing games they just don't exist in games so that's what i wanted to study when i was a graduate student what about games makes it impossible to feel that we can't achieve everything how can we take those feelings from games and apply them to real world work so i looked at games like world of warcraft which is really the ideal collaborative problem solving environment and i started to notice a few things that make epequins so possible in allline worlds so the first thing is whenever you show up in one of these allline games especially in world of worecraft there are lots and lots of different characters who are willing to trust you with a world saving mission right away but not just any mission it's a mission that is perfectly matched with your current level in the game right so you can do it they never give you a challenge that you can't achieve but it is on the verge of what you're capable of so you have to try hard but there's no unemployment in world of warcraft there's no sitting around bringing your hands there is always something specific and important to be done and there are also tons of collaborators everywhere you go hundreds of thousands of people ready to work with you to achieve your epic mission that's not something we have in real life that easily the sense that at our fingertips are tons of collaborators and also this epic story this inspiring story of why were there and what we're doing and then we get all this positive feedback you guys have heard of leveling up and plus one strength plus ones intelligence we don't get the kind of constant feedback in real life when i get off the stage i'm not going to have plus one speaking and plus one crazy idea plus twenty crazy idea i don't get that feedback in real life now the problem with collaborative online environments like world of warcraft is that it's so satisfying to be on the verge of an epic one all the time that we decide to spend all our time in these game worlds it's just better than reality so so far collectively all the road of warcraft gamers have spent five point nine three million years solving the virtual problems of asora now that's not necessarily a bad thing it might sound like it's a bad thing but to put that in context five point nine three million years ago was when our earliest primate human ancestors stood up that was the first upright primate ok so when we talk about how much time we're currently investing in playing games the only way it makes sense to even think about it is to talk about time at the magnitude of human evolution which is an extraordinary thing but it's also act because it turns out that by spending all this time playing games we're actually changing what we are capable of as human beings we're evolving to be more collaborative and hardy species this is true i believe this so consider this really interesting statistic i was recently published by a researcher at carnegie mellon university the average young person today in a country with a strong gamer culture will have spent ten thousand hours playing online games by the age of twenty one now ten thousand hours is a really interesting number for two reasons first of all for children in the united states ten thousand and eighty hours is the exact amount of time you will spend in school from fifth grade to high school graduation if you have perfect attendance we have an entire parallel track of education going on where young people are learning as much about what it takes to be a good gamer as they're learning about everything else in school but some of you have probably read malcolm gladwell's new book outliers so you would have heard of his theory of success the ten thousand hour theory of success it's based on this great cognitive science research that if we can master ten thousand hours of effortful study at anything by the age of twenty one we will be virtuoso that it will be as good at whatever we do as the greatest people in the world and so now what we're looking at is an entire generation of young people who are virtuoso gamers so the big question is what exactly our gamer is getting so good at because if we could figure that out we would have a virtually unprecedented human resource on our hands this is how many people we have in the world who spend at least an hour a day playing online games these are virtuoso gamers five hundred million people who are extraordinarily good at something and in the next decade we're going to have another billion gamers who are extraordinarily good at whatever that is if you don't know it already this is coming the game industry is developing consols that are low energy and that work with the wireless phone networks instead of broadband internet so that gamers all over the world particularly in india that china brazil can get online they expect one billion more gamers in the next decade so it brings up to one point five billion gamers so i started to think about what these games are making us virtuous as a here are the four things i came up with the first is urgent optimism okay think of this as extreme self motivation urgent optimism is the desire to act immediately to tackle an obstacle combined with the belief that we have a reasonable hope of success but gamers always believe that an epic one is possible i mean it is always worth trying and trying now game results around gamers are virtuosos at weaving a tight social fabric there's a lot of interesting research that shows that we like people better after we play a game with them even if they beaten us badly the reason is it takes a lot of trust to play a game with someone we trust that they will spend their time with us that they will play by the same rules value the same goal they'll stay with the game until it's over and so playing a game together actually builds up bonds and trust and cooperation and we actually build stronger social relationships as a result blissful productivity i love it you know there's a reason why the average world of warcraft gamer plays for twenty two hours a week kind of a half time job it's because we know when we're playing a game that we're actually happier working hard than we are but relaxing or hanging out we know that we are optimized as human beings to do hard meaningful work and gamers are willing to work hard all the time if they're given the right work finally epic meaning and gamers love to be attached to inspiring missions to human planetary scale stories so just one bit of trivia that helps put that into perspective so you all know wikipedia the biggest wiki in the world second biggest wiki in the world with nearly eighty thousand articles is the world of warcraft wiki five million people use it every month they have compiled more information about world of warcraft on the internet than any other topic covered on any other wiki in the world they are building an epic story they are building an epic knowledge resource about the world of warcraft okay so these are four superpowers that add up to one thing gamers are super empowered hopeful individuals these are people who believe that they are individually capable of changing the world and the only problem is they believe that they are capable of changing virtual worlds and not the real world that's a problem that i'm trying to solve there's an economist named ever castanova whose work is brilliant he looks at why people are investing so much time and energy and money in online worlds and he says we're witnessing what amounts to know less than a mass exitist to virtual worlds and online game environments and he's an economist so he's rational and he says not like me i'm a game designer i'm exuberant but he says he says that this makes perfect sense because gamers can achieve more in online worlds and they can in real life they can have stronger social relationships in games than they can have in real life they get better feedback and feel more rewarded in games than they do in real life so he says but for now it makes perfect sense for gamers to spend more time in virtual worlds and the real world now i also agree that that is rational for now but it is not by any means an optimal situation we have to start making the real world work more like a game so i take my inspiration from something that happened two thousand five hundred years ago these are ancient dice made out of sheep sneckles right before we had awesome game controllers we had sheep sneckles and these represent the first game equipment designed by human beings and if you're familiar with the work of the ancient greek historian heroists you might know this history which is the history of who invented games and why kardis says that games particularly die games were invented in the kingdom of lydia during a time of famine apparently there was such a severe famine that the king of lydia decided they had to do something crazy people were suffering people were fighting it was an extreme situation they needed an extreme solution so according toists they invented dice games and they set up a kingdom wide policy on one day everybody would eat and on the next day everybody would play games and they would be so immersed in playing the dice games because games are so engaging and immerse us and such satisfying blissful productivity they would ignore the fact that they had no food to eat and then on the next day they would play games and on the next day they would eat and according to hardicists they passed eighteen years this way surviving they were famine by eating home one day and playing games on the next now this is exactly i think how we're using games today we're using games to escape real world suffering we're using games to get away from everything that's broken in the real environment everything that's not satisfying about real life and we're getting what we need from games but it doesn't have to end there this is really exciting according to harditists after eighteen years the famine wasn't getting better so the king decided they would play one final by game they divided the entire kingdom in half they played one dice game and the winners of that game got to go but on a big adventure they would leave lydia and they would go out and search of a new place to live leaving behind just enough people to survive on the resources that were available and hopefully to take the civilization somewhere else where they could drive now this sounds crazy right but recently dna evidence has shown that the etruscans who then led to the roman empire actually share the same dna as the ancient ladens and so but recently scientists have suggested that herdicus is crazy story is actually true and geologists have found evidence of a global cooling that lasted for nearly twenty years that could have explained the famine so this crazy story might be true they might have actually save their culture by playing games escaping to games eighteen years and then been so inspired and knew so much about how to come together with games that they actually save the entire civilization that way okay we can do that we've been playing warcrast since nineteen ninety four that was the first real time strategy game from the world of warcrast series that was sixteen years ago they play dice games for eighteen years we've been playing work off for sixteen years i say we are ready for our own epic game now they had half the civilization go off in search of a new world so that's where i get my twenty one billion hours a week of game play from let's get half of us to agree to spend an hour a day playing games until we solve real world problems now i know you're asking how are we going to solve rural problems in games well that's what i have devoted my work to over the past few years at the institute for the future we have this manner in our offices in palo alto and it expresses our view of how we should try to relate to the future we do not want to try to predict the future what we want to do is make the future we want to imagine the best case scenario outcome and then we want to empower people to make that outcome in reality we want to imagine epic wins and then give people to means to achieve the epic win i'm just going to very briefly show you three games that i've made that are an attempt to give people the means to create epic wins in their own futures so this is world without oil we made this game in two thousand and seven this is an online game in which you try to survive an oil shortage and the oil shortage is fictional but we put enough online content out there for you to believe that it's real and to live your real life as if we run out of oil so when you come to the game you sign up you tell us where you live and then we give you real time news videos data feeds that show you exactly how much oil costs what's not available health food supplies being affected how transportation is being affected and if schools are closed if there's writing and you have to figure out how you would live your real life as if this were true and then we ask you to blog about it to post videos to post photos we piloted this game with seventeen hundred players in two thousand and seven and we've tracked them for the three years since and i can tell you that this is a transformative experience nobody wants to change how they live just because it's good for the world or because we're supposed to but if you immerse them in an ethic adventure and tell them but we find out of oil this is an amazing story an adventure for you to go on challenge yourself to see how you would survive most of our players have kept up the habits they learned in the game so for the next world saving game we decided to aim higher bigger problem than just peak oil we did a game called superstuck at the institute for the future and the premise was a supercomputer has calculated that humans have only twenty three years left on the planet the supercomputer was called the global extinction awareness system of course we asked people to come online almost like a jerry brockheimer movie new toy barkheimer movies you form a dream team you've got the astronaut the scientist ex convict and they all have something to do to save the world but in our game instead of just having five people on the dream team we said everybody's on the dream team and it's your job to invent the future of energy the future of food the future of health the future of security and the future of the social safety net we had eight thousand people play that game for eight weeks they came up with five hundred insanely creative solutions that you can go online if you google superstuction see so finally the last game we're launching at much third this is a game done with the world bank institute if you complete the game you will be certified by the world bank institute as a social innovator class of two thousand and ten working with universities all over sub saharan africa and we are inviting them to learn social innovation skills we've got a graphic novel we've got leveling up in skills like local insight knowledge networking sustainability vision and resourcefulness i would like to invite all of you to please share this game with young people anywhere in the world particularly in developing areas who might benefit from coming together to try to start to imagine their own social enterprises to save the world
[2m[36m(run_search_meeting pid=3659036)[0m i'm going to talk today about energy and climate and that might seem a bit surprising because my full time work of the foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds about the things that we need to invent and deliver to help the poorest two billion live better lives but energy and climate are extremely important to these people in fact more important than to anyone else on the planet the climate getting worse means that many years their crops won't grow there'll be too much rain not enough rain things will change in ways that their fragile environment simply can't support and that leads to starvation it leads to uncertainty it leads to unrest so that the climate changes will be terrible for them also the price of energy is very important to them in fact if you could pick just one thing the lower the price up to reduce poverty by far you would pick energy now the price of energy has come down over time really advanced civilization is based on advances in energy the coal revolution fueled the industrial revolution in the nineteen hundreds we've seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity and that's why we have refrigerators air conditioning we can make modern materials and do so many things and so we're in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world but as we make it cheaper and let's say let's go for making it twice as cheap we need to meet a new constraint and that constraint has to do with co two co two is warming the planet and the equation on co two is actually a very straightforward one if you sum up the co two that gets submitted that leads to a temperature increase and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects the effects on the weather perhaps worse the indirect effects in the natural ecosystems can't adjust to these rapid changes and so you get ecosystem collapses now the exact amount of how you map from a certain increase of co two to what temperature will be and where the positive feedbacks are there's some uncertainty there but not very much and there's certainly uncertainty about how bad those effects will be but they will be extremely bad i asked the top scientists and the several times do we really have to get down to near zero can't we just cut it in half a quarter and the answer is that until we get near to zero the temperature will continue to rise and so that's a big challenge it's very different than saying you know we're a twelve foot high truck trying to get under a ten foot bridge and we can just sort of squeeze under this is something that has to get to zero now we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year over twenty six billion tons for each american it's about twenty tons for people in poor countries it's less than one ton it's an average about five tons for everyone on the planet and somehow we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero it's been constantly going up it's only various economic changes that have even flattened at all so we have to go from rapidly rising to falling and falling all the way to zero this equation has four factors a little bit of multiplication so you've got a thing on the left co two that you want to get to zero and that's going to be based on the number of people the services each person juicy on average the energy on average for each service and the co two being put out a per unit of energy so let's look at each one of these and see how we can get this out into zero probably one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero that's back from high school algebra let's take a look first we've got population the world today has six point eight billion people that's headed up to about nine billion now if we do a really great job on new vaccines healthcare reproductive health services we could lower that by perhaps ten or fifteen percent but there we see an increase of about one point three the second factor is the services we use this encompasses everything the food we clothing tv heating these are very good things getting rid of poverty means providing these services to almost everyone on the planet and it's a great thing for this number to go up in the rich world perhaps the top one billion we probably could cut back and use less but every year this number on average is going to go up and so overall that will more than double the services delivered per person here we have a very basic service do you have lighting in your house to be able to read your homework and then in fact these kids don't so they're going out and reading their schoolwork under the street laps and now efficiency the energy for each service here finally we have some good news we have something that's not going up through various inventions and new ways of doing lighting through different types of cars different ways of building buildings there are a lot of services where you can bring the energy for that service down quite substantially some individual services even bring it down by ninety percent there are other services like how we make fertilizes or how we do our transport where the rooms for improvement are far far less and so overall here if we're optimistic we may get a reduction of a factor of three to even perhaps a factor of sex but for these first three factors now we've gone from twenty six billion to its best maybe thirteen billion tons and that just won't cut it so let's look at this fourth factor there's going to be a key one and this is the amount of co two put out for each unit of energy and so the question is can you actually get that to zero if you burn coal no if you burn natural gas almost every way we make electricity today except for the emerging renewables and nuclear puts out co two and so what we're going to have to do at a global scale is create a new system and so we need energy miracles now when i use the term miracle i don't mean something that's impossible the microprocessors a miracle the personal computers a miracle the internet and services are a miracle so the people here have participated in the creation of many miracles usually we don't have a deadline where you have to get the miracle by a certain date usually just kind of stand by and some come along some don't this is a case where we actually have to drive a full speed and get a miracle in a pretty tight timeline now i thought how could i really capture this is there's some kind of natural illustration some demonstration that would grab people's imagination here i thought back to a year ago when i brought mosquitoes and somehow people enjoyed that it really got them involved in the idea of you know there are people who lived in mosquitoes so with energy i like to come up with is this i decided that releasing fireflies would be my contribution to the environment here this year so here we have some natural fly flies i'm told they don't bite in fact they might even not even leave that jar now there's all sorts of geeky solutions like that one but they don't really add up too much we need solutions either one or several that have unbelievable scale and unbelievable reliability and although there's many directions of people seeking i really only see five that can achieve the big numbers i've left out time geothermal fusion biopules those may make some contribution and if they can do better than i expect so much the better but my key point here is that we're going to have to work on each of these five and we can't give up any of them because they look daunting because they all that have significant challenges let's look first at the burning fossil fuels either burning coal or burning natural gas what you need to do there it seems like it might be simple but it's not and that's to take all the co two after you burn it going out the flu pressurize it create a liquid put it somewhere and hope it stays there now we have some pilot things that do this at the sixty to eighty percent level but getting up to that full percentage that will be very tricky and a green on where these co two quantity should be put will be hard but the toughest one here is this long term issue who's going to be sure who's going to guarantee something that is literally billions of times larger than any type of waste you think of in terms of nuclear other things this is a lot of volume so that's the top one next would be nuclear it also has three big problems cost particularly in highly regulated countries is high the issue of the safety really feeling good about nothing can go wrong that even though you have these human operators that the fuel it doesn't get used for weapons and then what do you do with the waste although it's not very large there are a lot of concerns about that people need to feel good about it so three very tough problems that might be solvable and so should be worked on the last three of the five i've grouped together these are what people often refer to as the renewable sources and they actually although it's great they don't require fuel they have some disadvantages one is that the density of energy gather in these technologies is dramatically less than a power plant this is energy farming so you're talking about many square miles thousands of times more area than you think of as a normal energy plant also these are interment and sources the sun doesn't shine all day it doesn't shine every day and likewise the wind doesn't blow all the time and so you depend on these sources you have to have some way of getting energy during those time periods that it's not available so we've got big cost challenges here we have transmission challenges for example say this energy sources outside your country you not only need the technology but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from elsewhere and finally this storage problem and dimensionalized this i went through and looked at all the types of batteries that get made for cars for computers for phones for flashlights for everything and compared that to the amount of electrical energy the world uses and what i found is that all the batteries we make now could store less than ten minutes of all the energy and so in fact we need a big breakthrough here something that's going to be a factor of one hundred better than the approaches we have now it's not impossible but it's not a very easy thing now this shows up when you try to get the internet source to be above say twenty to thirty percent of what you're using if you're counting on it for one hundred percent you need an incredible miracle battery now how we're going to go forward on this what's the right approach is that a banhattan project what's the thing that can get us there well we need lots of companies working on this hundreds in each of these five paths we need at least one hundred people and a lot of them you look at and say they're crazy that's good and i think here in the ted group we have many people who are already pursuing this bill gross has several companies and clear one called e solar that has some great solar thermal technology the node colsas investing in dozens of companies that are doing great things and have interesting possibilities and i'm trying to help back that uneither marble than i actually are back in a company that perhaps surprisingly is actually taking the nuclear approach there are some innovations in nuclear modular liquid and innovation really stopped in this industry quite some time ago so the idea that there is some good ideas laying around is not all that surprising the idea of terror power is that instead of burning the part of uranium the one percent is that you two thirty five we decided well let's burn the ninety nine percent the u two thirty eight it is kind of a crazy idea in fact people have talked about it for a long time but they could never simulate properly whether it would work or not and so it threw the advent of modern supercomputers that now you can simulate and see that yes with the right materials approach this looks like it would work because you're bringing that ninety nine percent you have greatly improved cost profile you actually burn up the waste and you can actually use this fuel all the left over waste from today's reactors and so instead of worrying about them you just take that it's a great thing it breeds this uranium as it goes along so it's kind of like the candle you can see it's a log there often referred to as a traveling wave reactor in terms of fuel this really solves the problem i've got a picture here of a place in kentucky this is the left over of the ninety nine percent where they've taken out the part they are now so it's called depleted uranium that would power the u s for hundreds of years and simply by filtering seawater in an inexpensive process you'd have enough fuel for the entire lifetime of the rest of the planet so you know it's got lots lots of challenges i had but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward so let's think how should we measure ourselves what should our report card look like well let's go out to where we really need to get and then look at the intermediate for two thousand and fifty you've heard many people talk about this eighty percent reduction that really is very important that we get there and that twenty percent will be used up by things going on in poor countries still some agriculture hopefully we will have cleaned up forest cement so to get to that eighty percent the developed countries including countries like china will have had to switch their electric electricity generation all together so the other greatest are we deploying this zero emission technology we deployed in all the developed countries and we're in the process of getting it out elsewhere that's super important that's a key element of making that report card backing up from there what should the twenty twenty report card look like well again it should have the two elements we should go through these efficiency measures to start getting reductions the less we emit the less that some will be of co two and therefore the less the temperature but in some ways the grade we get there doing things that don't get us all the way to the big reductions is only equally or maybe even slightly less important than the other which is the piece of innovation on these breakthroughs these breakthroughs we need to move those at full speed and we can measure that in terms of companies pilot projects regulatory things that have been changed but there's a lot of great books that have been written about this the al gore book our choice and the david makai book sustainable energy without hot air they really go through it and i think can create a framework that this can be discussed broadly because we need broadbacking for this there's a lot that has to come together so this is a wish it's a very concrete wish that we invent this technology if you gave me only one wish for the next fifty years i can pick whose president i can pick a vaccine which is something i love or i could pick that this thing that's half the cost with no co two gets invented this is the wish i would pick this is the one of the greatest impact if we don't get this wish that vision between the people who think short term and long term will be terrible between us and china between poor countries and rich and most of all the lights of those two billion will be far worse so what do we have to do what am i appealing to you to step forward and and drive we need to go from more research funding when countries get together at places like copenhagen nation just discuss the co two they should discuss this innovation agenda and you'd be stunned at the ridiculously low levels of spending on these innovative approaches we do need the market incentives co two tacks kept trade something that gets that price signal out there we need to get the message out we need to have this dialogue be a more rational more understandable dialogue including the steps that the government takes this is an important wish but it is one i think we can achieve thank you thank you thank you thank you i understand more about terror power right i mean first of all can you give a sense of what sort of scale of investment this is but to actually do this software by the supercomputer higher all the great scientists which we've done that's only tens of millions and even once we test our materials out up in a russian reactor to make sure that our materials work properly then you'll only be up in hundreds of millions the tough thing is building the pilot reactor finding the several billion finding the regulator the location that will actually build the first one of these once you get the first one built if it works as advertising then it's just clear as day because the economics the energy density are so different than nuclear as we know and so to understand it right this involves building deep into the ground almost like like a vertical kind of column of nuclear fuel of this sort of spent uranium and then the process starts at the top and works down that's right today you're always refueling the reactors you have lots of people and lots of controls that can go wrong that thing where you're opening it up and moving things in and out that's that's not good so if you have very very cheap fuel then you can put sixty years in just think of it as a log put it down and not have those same complexities and it just sits there and burns for the sixty years and then it's done it's a nuclear power plant that is its own waste disposal solution yet what happens with waste you can let it sit there there's a lot less waste under this approach then you can actually take that and put it into another one and burn that and we start out actually by taking the waste that exists today that's sitting in these cooling pools of dry casking by reactors that's our fuel to begin with so the thing that's been a problem from those reactors is actually what gets fed into ours and you're reducing the volume of the way quite dramatically as you're going through this process i mean you're talking to different people around the world about the possibilities here where is there most interest in actually doing something with this well we haven't picked a particular place but there's all these interesting disclosure rules anything that's called nuclear so we've got a lot of interest that people from the company have been in russia india china i've been back seeing the secretary of energy here talking about how this fits into the energy agenda so i'm optimistic the french and japanese have done some work this is a bariant on something that has been done it's an important advance but it's like a fast reactor and a lot of countries have built them so anybody who's not a fast reactor is a candidate to be where the firstone gets built so in your mind time scale and likelihood of actually taking something like this life what we need for one of these the high scale electric electrical generation things that's very cheap we have twenty years to invent and then twenty years to deploy that's sort of the deadline that the environmental models environmental models have shown us that we have to meet and terror power if things go well which is wishing for a lot could easily meet that and there are fortunately now dozens of companies we need to be hundreds who likewise if their science goes well if they're funding for their plant pilot plants goes well they can compete for this and it's best if multiple succeed because then you can use a mix a mix of these things we certainly need one to succeed i mean in terms of big scale possible game changes this is the biggest that you're aware about there an energy breakthrough is the most important thing it would have been even without the environmental constraint but the environmental constraint just makes it so much so much greater in the nuclear space there are other innovators you know we don't know their work as well as we know this one but the modular people that's a different approach there's a liquid type reactor which seems a little hard but maybe they say about us and so there are different ones but the beauty of this is a molecule the uranium has a million times as much energy as a molecule of say coal and so if you can deal with the negatives which are essentially the radiation the footprint and cost the potential in terms of effect on land and various things is almost in a class of its own if this doesn't work then what do we have to start taking emergency measures to try and keep the temperature of the earth stable you get into that situation it's like if you're you've been overeating then you're about to have a heart attack then then where do you go you may need heart search or something there is a line of research on what's called geoengineering which are various techniques that would delay the heating to buy us twenty or thirty years to get our act together now you hope that's just an intrance policy you hope you don't need to do that some people say you should even work on the intrance policy because it might make you lazy that you'll keep eating because you know heart surgery will be there to save you i'm not sure that's why given the importance of the problem but now the geoengineering discussion about should that be in the back pocket in case things happen faster or this innovation goes a lot slower than we expect

is actually taking the nuclear approach there are some innovations in nuclear modular liquid and innovation really stopped in this industry quite some time ago so the idea that there is some good ideas laying around is not all that surprising the idea of terror power is that instead of burning the part of uranium the one percent is that you two thirty five we decided well let's burn the ninety nine percent the u two thirty eight it is kind of a crazy idea in fact people have talked about it for a long time but they could never simulate properly whether it would work or not and so it threw the advent of modern supercomputers that now you can simulate and see that yes with the right materials approach this looks like it would work because you're bringing that ninety nine percent you have greatly improved cost profile you actually burn up the waste and you can actually use this fuel all the left over waste from today's reactors and so instead of worrying about them you just take that it's a great thing it breeds this uranium as it goes along so it's kind of like the candle you can see it's a log there often referred to as a traveling wave reactor in terms of fuel this really solves the problem i've got a picture here of a place in kentucky this is the left over of the ninety nine percent where they've taken out the part they are now so it's called depleted uranium that would power the u s for hundreds of years and simply by filtering seawater in an inexpensive process you'd have enough fuel for the entire lifetime of the rest of the planet so you know it's got lots lots of challenges i had but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward so let's think how should we measure ourselves what should our report card look like well let's go out to where we really need to get and then look at the intermediate for two thousand and fifty you've heard many people talk about this eighty percent reduction that really is very important that we get there and that twenty percent will be used up by things going on in poor countries still some agriculture hopefully we will have cleaned up forest cement so to get to that eighty percent the developed countries including countries like china will have had to switch their electric electricity generation all together so the other greatest are we deploying this zero emission technology we deployed in all the developed countries and we're in the process of getting it out elsewhere that's super important that's a key element of making that report card backing up from there what should the twenty twenty report card look like well again it should have the two elements we should go through these efficiency measures to start getting reductions the less we emit the less that some will be of co two and therefore the less the temperature but in some ways the grade we get there doing things that don't get us all the way to the big reductions is only equally or maybe even slightly less important than the other which is the piece of innovation on these breakthroughs these breakthroughs we need to move those at full speed and we can measure that in terms of companies pilot projects regulatory things that have been changed but there's a lot of great books that have been written about this the al gore book our choice and the david makai book sustainable energy without hot air they really go through it and i think can create a framework that this can be discussed broadly because we need broadbacking for this there's a lot that has to come together so this is a wish it's a very concrete wish that we invent this technology if you gave me only one wish for the next fifty years i can pick whose president i can pick a vaccine which is something i love or i could pick that this thing that's half the cost with no co two gets invented this is the wish i would pick this is the one of the greatest impact if we don't get this wish that vision between the people who think short term and long term will be terrible between us and china between poor countries and rich and most of all the lights of those two billion will be far worse so what do we have to do what am i appealing to you to step forward and and drive we need to go from more research funding when countries get together at places like copenhagen nation just discuss the co two they should discuss this innovation agenda and you'd be stunned at the ridiculously low levels of spending on these innovative approaches we do need the market incentives co two tacks kept trade something that gets that price signal out there we need to get the message out we need to have this dialogue be a more rational more understandable dialogue including the steps that the government takes this is an important wish but it is one i think we can achieve thank you thank you thank you thank you i understand more about terror power right i mean first of all can you give a sense of what sort of scale of investment this is but to actually do this software by the supercomputer higher all the great scientists which we've done that's only tens of millions and even once we test our materials out up in a russian reactor to make sure that our materials work properly then you'll only be up in hundreds of millions the tough thing is building the pilot reactor finding the several billion finding the regulator the location that will actually build the first one of these once you get the first one built if it works as advertising then it's just clear as day because the economics the energy density are so different than nuclear as we know and so to understand it right this involves building deep into the ground almost like like a vertical kind of column of nuclear fuel of this sort of spent uranium and then the process starts at the top and works down that's right today you're always refueling the reactors you have lots of people and lots of controls that can go wrong that thing where you're opening it up and moving things in and out that's that's not good so if you have very very cheap fuel then you can put sixty years in just think of it as a log put it down and not have those same complexities and it just sits there and burns for the sixty years and then it's done it's a nuclear power plant that is its own waste disposal solution yet what happens with waste you can let it sit there there's a lot less waste under this approach then you can actually take that and put it into another one and burn that and we start out actually by taking the waste that exists today that's sitting in these cooling pools of dry casking by reactors that's our fuel to begin with so the thing that's been a problem from those reactors is actually what gets fed into ours and you're reducing the volume of the way quite dramatically as you're going through this process i mean you're talking to different people around the world about the possibilities here where is there most interest in actually doing something with this well we haven't picked a particular place but there's all these interesting disclosure rules anything that's called nuclear so we've got a lot of interest that people from the company have been in russia india china i've been back seeing the secretary of energy here talking about how this fits into the energy agenda so i'm optimistic the french and japanese have done some work this is a bariant on something that has been done it's an important advance but it's like a fast reactor and a lot of countries have built them so anybody who's not a fast reactor is a candidate to be where the firstone gets built so in your mind time scale and likelihood of actually taking something like this life what we need for one of these the high scale electric electrical generation things that's very cheap we have twenty years to invent and then twenty years to deploy that's sort of the deadline that the environmental models environmental models have shown us that we have to meet and terror power if things go well which is wishing for a lot could easily meet that and there are fortunately now dozens of companies we need to be hundreds who likewise if their science goes well if they're funding for their plant pilot plants goes well they can compete for this and it's best if multiple succeed because then you can use a mix a mix of these things we certainly need one to succeed i mean in terms of big scale possible game changes this is the biggest that you're aware about there an energy breakthrough is the most important thing it would have been even without the environmental constraint but the environmental constraint just makes it so much so much greater in the nuclear space there are other innovators you know we don't know their work as well as we know this one but the modular people that's a different approach there's a liquid type reactor which seems a little hard but maybe they say about us and so there are different ones but the beauty of this is a molecule the uranium has a million times as much energy as a molecule of say coal and so if you can deal with the negatives which are essentially the radiation the footprint and cost the potential in terms of effect on land and various things is almost in a class of its own if this doesn't work then what do we have to start taking emergency measures to try and keep the temperature of the earth stable you get into that situation it's like if you're you've been overeating then you're about to have a heart attack then then where do you go you may need heart search or something there is a line of research on what's called geoengineering which are various techniques that would delay the heating to buy us twenty or thirty years to get our act together now you hope that's just an intrance policy you hope you don't need to do that some people say you should even work on the intrance policy because it might make you lazy that you'll keep eating because you know heart surgery will be there to save you i'm not sure that's why given the importance of the problem but now the geoengineering discussion about should that be in the back pocket in case things happen faster or this innovation goes a lot slower than we expect climate skeptics if you had a sentence or two to say to them how might you persuade them that their wrong well unfortunately the skeptics come in different camps i mean the ones who make scientific arguments are very few you know are they saying that there's negative feedback effects that have to do with clouds that offset things they are very very few things that they can even say you know there's a chance in a million of those things the main problem you have here it's kind of like aids that you make them a state now and you pay for it a lot later and so when you have all sorts of urgent problems the idea of taking pain now that has to do with the gain later in a somewhat uncertain painting in fact the ipcc report you know that but that's not necessarily the worst case and there are people in the ritual to look at ipcc and say okay that isn't that big good deal the fact is that uncertain part that should move towards us but my dream here is that if you can make it economic and meet the co two constraint then the skeptics say ok i don't care that it doesn't put out co two kind of we should did put out co two but i guess all except because it's cheaper then right let's come before so and so that would be your response to the beyond numbal argument that basically if you spend all this energy trying to solve the co two problem it's going to take away all your other goals of trying to rid the world of poverty and malaria and so forth it's a stupid waste of the earth's resources to put money towards that one there are better things we can do yet well the actual spending on the r dps say the u should spend ten billion or more than it is right now it's not that dramatic it should't take away from other things the thing you get into big money on
