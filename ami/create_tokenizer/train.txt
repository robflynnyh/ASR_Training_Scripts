no
ninja homer made in japan
and there isn't uh d it doesn't open up to the advanced functions so the advanced functions are still hidden from you but they're hidden in the sense that um they're not in use
um they're in the l c d  panel and the jog dial okay 'cause
the l c d  panel just displays um functionally what you're doing if you're using an advanced function right like um
c brightness contrast whatever it will just say you know it's like it only has four columns it's a very simple
l c d  like whereas many the minimum amount we need that the user will automatically know like this is brightness or this is contrast
it might even be one a bit more complex l c d  panel with pictures like maybe the sun or the you know the the symbols of the various functions
that's a number pad
um they're al along this yeah
you have this space here and then you have this thing on the side as well or at the bottom
'cause slogans are usually quite small right they're not like huge so they're s
say a button's about say a button's about this size right so you would still have plenty of space for a slogan say even for that
yep so that would be about a centimetre for a button so one two three
four centimetres plus maybe half o five
six seven eight about yeah nine total
nine ten
yep
excuse me
sure
oh we've discussed how h high it is but how wide is it
no as in the height but what about the width
do we need five i don't think five is be about th three and a half
yeah yeah
okay things like um brightness contrast um maybe tuning the channels
um
what else um the various inputs are you having a v c r  are you having you know which input do you have
um
yep colour sharpness um a lot of these things will have to be um free and open for users to define them
audio we have like your basic y your base your mid range your high range
um
yep left right balance um maybe even pre programmed sound modes like um the user could determine like a series of sound modes and then what could happen would be um when you click on that then it would go to that setting
yeah
the battery
no
um
we need an
yep
yeah advanced chip we need an advanced chip i think yep let me just confirm that yes i think so
yep
yeah
yep
plastic
i think we're gonna have to skip the rubber
um
yep
for the case itself one colour it's one special colour
'cause the case unit itself the rest of our components go on top of it
yes
one and the l c  display
how many
we've got push buttons as well
okay let's just be safe and put like say four buttons for that one
okay um and maybe a special colour for the buttons so maybe four again
'cause that's one button by its the complexity of twelve buttons
so we're just estimating that yeah it would be less
no
yep yep

how much would that save us that will only save you one the other thing could be that um you could take away the l c d  panel and the advanced chip together um because when you
do something on the t v  the t v  responds and reacts as well so the user could be looking at the t v  and pushing his thing so we may not need to so when we scroll we need just some way to get the t v  to respond which i think is a technically doable thing so

yep
and the advanced chip goes away as well
regular chip
yep
so what that means is that um
the twelve buttons that you see there
functionally you're gonna have to intercept so four is a good estimate for
yeah so you can't actually cut it's like three times the number of buttons four eight twelve
it it needs to be more than one big button because if you open up your phone underneath there's actually one button underneath it's just that the panel itself is a single panel
we just report that it has to be over budget or the colours you could take away s colours for th for the buttons
normal coloured buttons
no that's not the button we're talking about that's the buttons only refer to the pad so
should we take that off uh
hey it's back to the original um so then these just become normal coloured buttons so that might be some some way of cutting the cost
yeah

what do you mean by profile
no
we didn't have enough play doh to make it three d 
so there's one more dimension to the thing which we need to to add and you might want to add in the report length width and height
yeah
yeah
two
this is about this is about two
slightly more than two so
okay
i think that's something that's very hard to catch so you you restrict the number of people who wanna try something
the the look and the colour is something which is cool but i think that there's also that factor of if it's too unfamiliar
then um because when you put it on the shelf
yeah button shape might be a good idea to change rather than rather than positioning 'cause i think positioning is we're kinda engrained into the the telephone kind of
pad
maybe we should do the design evaluation first
i don't think you need the power so
no that's okay that's okay
no the power cord itself yeah so then you have a bit more freedom to
you you still have your blue fingers
you killed a monster
i rate that pretty highly
yep i'm fine with that
it's one to seven right
wait what's the scale one to seven right
okay it's upside down

say it's more
medium but going towards a little bit higher than medium kind of thing yep

lemon
okay the blue the blue colours and don't re don't actually represent the colour except for the b the the red button they because for want of a
yeah the the yellow is more representative of the colour but the button itself the blue can be anything else
yep that's fine
yeah company logo
i think it'll be cost prohibitive yeah
yep
the cameras did
yep
it keeps getting too big
'kay i'm i'm listening i'm just trying to incorporate the logo into the the thing so i'm playing with the play doh as well
just in case you're wondering why is he still playing with the play doh
just about right l e g o  lego

you feel like you're caged within whatever y it's like a balloon in a cage it can only go so big and not hit the side the constraints do come in very fast
yeah
i think another point is that the meetings um are more brainstorming sessions than meetings so time
is also a very s um strong factor and structure because for a brainstorming meeting you want a structure
that allows you to allows ideas to get tossed um to be evaluated and to be reviewed and
to get feedback and come back
and i guess that point about the room not being r very friendly to that i think that's a very big thing
and i think the fact that we're wearing these things restricts i feel it 'cause i wear m my glasses right and that but that
irritates me right it it it does actually you know affect how w whether you feel comfortable to
communicate i feel like i'm hiding behind the equipment rather than the equipment is helping me and you know
not not so much an atmosphere the atmosphere is very relaxed but the the gear yeah you know that creates boundaries to that um and and the time the time given also restricts


excuse me


i think controlling is not the right word i think the interactions are very structured i think structure is probably what you're saying that
each individual is structured to one particular task and one parti rather than controlling i don't think there's a sense of control
'cause all the decisions have been made in terms of a like a consensus right we go around and we think about it but
that you know process actually says you have to do it in a certain way it doesn't tell you you know some
ways that you might wanna be a bit more creative in terms of the process you know not the
i think you tried to use the common share folder to to to to communicate but um it just comes back to us so slow in the email um it it doesn't have a you know a messenger will go
yeah
okay
i think the tools that they were given the tool set that were given to us are fancy but they don't support collaboration i think that's the word they don't support the team working together you know they're still very individual tools
we had play doh fun
no not really
i think um the the focus of it a lot was the powerpoint as opposed to the to the whiteboard and i think that
m um is also does you know hinder us and things i think it will be cooler to have the
whiteboard rather than the the powerpoint or maybe the whiteboard and the powerpoint in the same place
you know in the centre of the
i think that there were too many powerpoints in the meetings 'cause the plug in and the plugging spent we spent a lot of time doing that and a lot of
the information on the powerpoints i don't think you know we needed to actually it could have we could have gone through it
verbally especially my slides i felt that they just you know as opposed to having to present them
yep clunky agreed
having to tick it before you go off was a bit hindering as well 'cause you're half way through a thought and then you run out of paper and then you have to jump
but i think the pen is v is very intuitive everybody knows how to use it we don't have to worry so i think the pen's good it's about the best thing
yeah we only needed one computer and
and the computer may not um be conducive to a meeting because um you tend to look at your computer and wanna have the urge to check something you know it's useful but
i think too many computers are just distracting um
yep
and we have ninja homer


ninja homer see it looks like homer simpson
but it's electronic so it's made in japan yeah it's just a logo
ninja homer
the the red is supposed to represent the whatever else you wanna print on the side of it
you can wear homer you can throw homer when you're frustrated doh
it's clunky
oh i did learn something new play doh is useful no it is it is it is useful and in in in in
in in in um conceptualizing in being creative 'cause like you say it's something you can put your hands on
and feel and touch and get a sense for like we were playing with the play doh and the ideas came with the play doh rather than
with everything else you might wanna write that down it's just i'm just fiddling with the play doh and i'm going yeah yeah it's kinda cool
no all play doh is edible
it's just wheat it's the stuff that your mom could make with preservatives and uh
it's helpful to the creative process um it engages all your senses not just your sight but your sense of feel your sense of touch and it helps you to understand

dimension as well i think that that's very helpful because it it starts to pop up whereas on a piece of paper on a computer on a board
um even with a three d  graphic thing it still it requires a lot of yeah tangible
that's a nice word it becomes tangible

nope
i think we could probably do it here as long as we don't collaborate
can we turn off the microphones
okay we all all set right well this is the uh final detailed
design meeting um we're gonna discuss the look and feel design the user
interface design and we're gonna evaluate the product and the end result of this meeting has
to be a decision on the details of this remote control like absolute final decision um and then i'm
gonna have to specify the final design in the final report
so um just from from last time to recap we said we were gonna
have a snowman shaped remote control with no l c d  display no need for talk back it was hopefully
gonna be kinetic power and battery uh with rubber buttons maybe backlighting the buttons
with some internal l e d s to shine through the casing um hopefully a jog dial and
incorporating the slogan somewhere as well anything i've missed okay um
so uh if you want to present your prototype go ahead
okay
mm
mm hmm
so w what kind of thing uh is gonna be
mm hmm okay cool
oh right okay cool
where are we gonna have the slogan
okay cool

okay
okay
so if this isn't to scale what kind of
dimensions are you thinking about here
mm hmm
six seven eight nine ten
so we're talking about ten centimetres that would be good so ten centimetres in height okay um
yeah
that's great and it's very bright as well so um okay
okay so just could you just list all the things that it does s so i can write them in the report
mm hmm
okay
okay so that's like an okay button right
okay
oh oh like depth of the actual thing
oh is this k to get an idea of scale from your from your thing there okay so you can power on and off what else can you do
okay
okay jog dial for volume
and what else do you do with the jog dial
contrast brightness yeah and anything else
well of the designers what are they
uh huh
okay channel tuning that's a good one
okay auxiliary inputs
sharpness
okay what about uh sound settings uh d can you change any of those at all
okay
okay is there anything else at all it can do
that 'cause that's that's fine just need to know so i can write it down okay um right i g i guess that's it so we can now um
we can now have a little look at the
the excel sheet and price listing and see if we need to
um if we need to rethink anything at all so um for this first part here power wise have we got battery do we have kinetic as well no okay just battery
and that's because of cost restraints is it okay um what about the electronics here advanced chip
okay um the case what does it mean by single and double do you know
so we want double curved okay
um
is there any rubber at all in the buttons or any
okay um and we wanted special colours didn't we so i'll have to put that oh no wait we ho how many colours have we got there
just one colour okay
okay so interface wise is it this third option we have the two of them there
okay and then buttons we have what two colours
like uh oh wait so push button and integrated scroll wheel push okay
uh huh
okay
okay
four so w why are we arriving at the number four where does the number four come from
okay right so we're writing down four
okay
how about these are we wanting them in no they're just is everything gonna be plastic okay so
we're w w quite far over now we're gonna something's gonna have to go um we're at sixteen
point eight and
well we h something has to go to the tune of two point t three euro so let me see what are we i mean oh yes sorry four point three my maths is all out
yeah
how much would that save us one
okay so
so w what's our reviewed suggestion um take away the l c  display
to be replaced with a regular chip
okay
and so we've got point three to get rid of um and we ha where are the four the four push buttons are where exactly now
twelve buttons
yeah
do you think
like is is that one big button or is it twelve buttons how can it be something in between
mm
okay well we have point three to get rid of somewhere
mm
no can do
well do you want colour differentiation here
oh yeah sorry yeah then
right so
ah
that's it
okay ach that's a shame um right so take away that completely ah and now we're under budget so we do have point five euro to play with if we wanted um
doesn't say so
yeah that's a good idea
just one
does that mean that one button has a special form or
yeah okay well well there we go so i'm just gonna have to redraw this now so we're not gonna have the l c d  anymore and we'll just gonna have an on t on the t v  it'll show you what you're doing which i think is fair enough and so this is gonna be one big thing here
um
right okay so just to well to be thorough then width wise we're looking at about what three centimetres or something
okay and then so height wise
how how tall do you envisage it being about that big about two centimetres okay
okay ach that is yeah okay we'll s we'll say two point five okay um so we have it within cost anyway
um so yeah project evaluation is this point
um
right uh
okay so can we close that this is what it's the final spec that it's gonna be someone is gonna have to yeah that's fine that's fine
okay
right um
so at this point we uh let me see discuss uh how satisfied we all are with um
with these four points with the room for creativity in the project and leadership and teamwork and the stuff we had around us i guess um let me see uh
yeah i wasn't really sure what that was
yeah yeah go for that first i wasn't entirely sure what uh who was supposed to be doing that but y you go for it

okay
okay
yeah

oh there it is
mm 'kay
okay
well yeah i mean compared to most remote controls you see that's pretty good i dunno like a six or something what does anybody else think
mm
mm
okay
i would say five or six david
okay
oh yes sorry then then i would say two or three
yeah

well it has the wee jog dial but
mm
i'd go with three or four maybe three
yeah about three okay
well that's kind of
but the yellow i mean it could be a lemon yellow colour couldn't it
yeah
mm hmm
well yeah i mean it's really basic looking isn't it i mean i'd give that nearly a one
five that's really low well
yeah i suppose mm 'kay
yep gonna have that on the side aren't we like there or something
out of forty nine i guess
's pretty good
uh yeah
twice that about thirty one
so yeah ab well yeah about sixty nine seventy percent yeah
it's pretty good
okay

nobody saw it honestly
is that you all have all finished or
uh huh
mm hmm
okay
right
okay great um are you submitting the
the um evaluation criteria or am i i don't know what your instructions have been
okay uh just wondering if i need to include it in the minutes because if you're submitting it anyway then okay great
cool um right uh well next up then because we've done finance is the project evaluation
oh right okay
right okay um well do you wanna um just individually say what you think about about these four points and or not those four points my four points sorry forgotten that
you got a different uh

oh yeah they're good aren't they yeah right okay um yeah here we are uh as a note we'll do this
alphabetically um do you wanna start andrew
i don't know just um your opinion on those four those four points really and how we used them yeah
uh huh
well d do you feel though that that you were able to have quite a lot of creative input into the thing
but i don't i don't think it means the room as in this room i think it means like you know
yeah
room
oh yeah well i dunno do you th i think it means um i think it means did you feel you were able to give creative input so
mm hmm
mm
okay
okay

okay uh do you know what actually let's take each point and everybody discuss it i think yeah so still on the topic of room for creativity uh next up is craig
yeah
yeah
mm
yeah
so you think a more relaxed atmosphere would be more kind of conducive to creative thought or
yeah but actual environment
okay
okay
very good um what about leadership
i don't know if that means like if i did a good job or something i don't really know
from like your personal coach person and stuff like that do you think maybe
okay
mm hmm
uh huh okay
so you think maybe a little too controlling or
okay
uh huh
okay
okay uh what about teamwork
yeah
okay
mm
did uh did you guys get the email i sent you oh that's alright i was wondering if that got there okay okay
um so um to s to to summarize the teamwork issue saying that if we could communicate outside
the meeting you know just like quick questions quick thoughts whatever it probably would be bit
easier
oh right okay
mm
yeah
yeah
okay
okay
right uh anything else to say on teamwork at all okay um what about
the you know how we used the whiteboard the digital pens the projector stuff like that
um did anybody think anything was like really useful anything was pretty un f

unsupportive
mm
mm hmm
yeah
and point at yeah
yeah
ah
so do you think producing a prototype earlier in the process woulda been a good idea
yeah
okay
alright
okay uh
yeah
yeah
okay
what about the digital pens did you find them easy enough to use
yeah
clunky okay um

yeah
i know i think at the very start of today i like wrote a whole load of stuff didn't click note on
one then went back and wrote one tiny wee thing on the another page but then did click note and so i'm quite worried that i've
just written over the top of it or something but they'll have my paper anyway um and haven't done that since
yeah yeah
yeah
yeah that's true
yeah
do you think the computers just provide distraction in a meeting
okay
i know i i like to have things written down in front of me actually like a lot of the stuff that was emailed to me i ended up you know like writing down there or something so i could look at it really quickly and not have the distraction of all of that um i don't know about anybody else
um what else uh any wh i do
i'm not really sure what they're looking for when they say new ideas found um i don't know is could
you think of like anything else that would have been helpful today at all
mm yeah if we just had uh

mm hmm
yeah i i dunno i think it was quite good that we had time limits on the meetings because they really could have run
on and like my experience with meetings is that they really do and you can spend a lot of time talking about the only thing is though like when we had
our meeting about the conceptual design i thought there maybe another fifteen minutes would have been useful there but um
yeah
i really thi i i think maybe if we'd like all been working in the one room and they just said you know like every
hour or something everybody make sure yo you know just have a have a short meeting and then just c just to have
like something written down just like you know a a milestone if you like um rather than
having meetings but
there you go um so in closing i haven't got my five minutes to go thin oh there it
i five minutes to go wonderful okay um are the costs within the budget yes they are
and is the project evaluated yes it is so now celebrate
well apparently now i write the final report what are you guys doing now
you dunno
that is lovely
so is that j is that just is that just a logo or does it do anything just a logo and then like ninja homer right okay
i think it's quite nice

oh no that's cool it's got i'm kind of i'm slightly gutted that we couldn't get plastic and rubber i think that would have been nice

ah well maybe from now on real reaction should give us more money
play doh s
really
yeah
did they
okay
play doh
yeah it smells funny doesn't it um
yeah like the stuff for i think it has to be yeah
yeah um so to wha what are your summarising words about play doh
okay

yeah
yeah
mm hmm
tangible
okay uh
mm i don't know if there's anything else we needed to discuss
that that's about it really
just sit still i guess for a little while
um
well i dunno um i'm sure the little uh the little thing'll pop up any minute now
yeah yeah if the meeting's over then yeah i guess so
mm 'kay
where are they
ah right great
right
okay
right
right 'kay
okay
mm hmm and what is this here
okay so the number pad is 'kay great
mm
yep
looks good
yep
mm hmm
okay
mm hmm
about nine in total
that sounds good yeah
yep
that'd be good in fact a pen is about ten centimetres usually so that would be that sounds like a really good size if you see it there
mm
is it possible uh i'm just gonna bring up the idea of colours is these are these the colours that of production or is this just what we had available
right
mm hmm
how high is it
yeah
okay
sure
three and a half
mm hmm
mm hmm mm hmm
mm hmm probably colour or sharpness
mm hmm
audio
mm hmm
mm 'kay
mm
or even clear
uh how mm hmm how are we going to achieve this high end product if
we only have very sparse
two point three four point three no
and then where is the
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm

yeah we could just go with um
hmm
mm hmm
mm

how about with embossing the logo isn't that going to cost us some money
yeah
that's a freebie
was the goal in your in your prototype design that it be as low profile as possible
sort of flat as possible
yeah
yeah that's what i was thinking to sure okay
yeah alright yeah fair enough okay just thought i'd ask
mm hmm
hmm
two's not very high at all though maybe a bit higher
yeah
maybe closer to three even or two and a half
mm hmm
mm hmm
um it's probably just i dunno if it's worth getting into but um
just in in that we want this to be stylish should we think a little bit more out of the box in terms of a button grid because i've seen there's
lots of devices out there that that instead of taking your standard nine nine square grid and they have it
sort of stylized or in different concept that that
yeah
sure okay
yeah alright
okay sure
what about button shape square buttons
okay
yeah
sure
yeah
mm 'kay
do you want me to d um
do you want me to do my um design evaluation last
or
evaluation
okay
sure
um alright so the way this works i'm gonna need to plug into powerpoint i'll try and do it as quick as possible um this is um i'll just go over your head if that's okay

what's that
i don't need the powerpoint
oh course yeah that's true let me get that
a bit more
okay so what this is is a set up for us to um uh use a kind of a like a
the idea is that i've set up i've reviewed all of the um the points of discussion from the beginning and used that as
a criteria of evaluation for the um uh for the current
design uh th or the plan and uh so we can review that uh i think it's gonna end up being sort of
elementary because we're sort we're in n we're not gonna probably use it to change anything but
doesn't seem like it's going does it
yeah okay great uh and i'm gonna write up our results on the board so this'll be a way for us to go through and decide if we're um sort of review where we stand with it
okay so um
so to sort of b bring together two things sort of design goals and also the market research that we had uh when we rate
this one is v high in in succeeding or fitting to our original aim and seven is low okay
so these i these i th are the and um we've been asked to uh to collectively rate this so what we can do is
try and just y work on a consensus system so
we just come to an agreement okay so the first one uh stylish look and feel
yeah
yeah
yeah um me uh my only reservation with it was that we basically went with yellow because it's the company's colour and i don't know if yellow's gonna really be a hit
but
what do you guys think
okay
okay let's go with five then
fi oh uh just actually the opposite
the so it meant three okay
yeah one is high
'kay
let's go with two point five then okay um control high tech innovation
we had to remove
yeah so we've had to remove a few of our features we wanted but jog dial
's good
okay three
okay um
style reflects a fruit inspired colour design i shouldn't have said colour but just
sorta
yeah
okay
right yeah could be yeah
okay
okay so we'll go two
yeah
okay and um design is simple to use simple in features
f f yeah f fairly basic you guys think
yeah one okay
um soft and spongy have we achieved that we've used mostly plastic in the end so it's going to be quite a bit of a compromise for price five
that's
um
could we have used an entirely rubber frame to it was that an option
it would cost more than plastic
okay logo we've got it in there haven't we
huh and um it's within budget yep it is isn't it
okay so we can say then that uh out of a possible or what would be our goal here
yeah out of forty nine with with zero being the highest
we are at uh two seven eight ten fifteen point five
so it's pretty good
translates to something like about approximately seventy two percent efficacy
of our original goal
right
i think 'cause if you turn that into
a hundred
it would be about
about thirty one and then invert that it's
oh right about seventy yeah seventy percent
okay good that was just a little formality for us to go through
yep oh hundred pound pen sorry alright no
hmm
yeah that's that's me i did have one other um one other frame i thought i mean i i d not knowing how we would deal
with this information i thought okay in theory this kind of a process would be about refining our design revisiting
our original goals it's not something i need to p push through but i thought should we thinking more about the dimensions
um sort of like more of a three dimensional shapes as well as opposed to just that flat um
could our design involve a series of colours so that it's more of like a line where we have like sort of the i don't know like the harvest line or the vibrant
i dunno the whatever just some theme and then we have different tones lime green lemon
it's just discussion i mean obviously we can just abandon this it's fine i'm just thinking about what we originally set out to do
um yep so there that's all
um i think to record it and uh i haven't been asked to submit it yet yeah
i will yeah
huh

yep
i like those printer cables that just have the two little butterfly clips like that it's really quick
to use
sure um so what is it you're asking of me now
or sort of our work on setting this up yeah well is it uh okay i'll just go through your system then the the room uh
is fairly institutional but um the main thing is i think
um our use of this space is more just to report on things as opposed to be creative and constructive
and it would probably help to um have l sort of a cumulative effect of we have ideas
and we come back and then the ideas are still in discussion you know as in other words this this room is sort of a centre point of creativity
whereas in reality as we've gone through this it's not really the centre point of creativity it's more just a
d debating
yeah yeah but that's just the thing is the quest in terms of the the first point there the room it feels as though the creativity goes on when we leave and then we come here and then we kind of put out our ideas and then you know
oh oh right right oh right okay room for creativ oh right i just looked up and saw okay whiteboard digital pens the room no of course yeah
sorry
huh
yeah
yeah i th okay on th um yeah dif answering the question uh in those terms i'd say
that actually there's sort of a tease of creativity because we're asked to work through
this but actually the guidelines are fairly contrived in terms of um okay
fashion trends say fruit and vegetable colour scheme but then i then we're told okay use the co company company colours
so what do we do we're told okay um think in terms of style and look and feel and technology but build something
for twelve and a half pounds so actually the creativity was more more of like a um
a f sort of a f formality then an actual
yeah within the constraints the
yeah
yeah yeah so
yeah
yep
yeah
yeah
mm hmm mm hmm
yeah yeah
yeah
yeah sure
yeah
new creativity
yep
right
mm
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah well well i mean my sense on that is sort of what kind of guidance and direction encouragement
yeah from and you as well i think just sort of acting as team leader
um yeah i think i think it's i think it's good i mean my personal views on on leadership is that effective effective leadership sort of um gives people a certain room for freedom and delegation but then to come back with something that they take great ownership and
you know innovative thought with in in reality i think here the the different elements of leadership such as the
the original b briefing and then the personal coach and the and then you know having having you with your the meeting agenda
is actually quite a quite a quite a con confining framework to work within and so it
is leadership almost to the point of sort of disempowering the the the team member
so
but it's not bad leadership it's just sort of s fairly strong you know it turns it turns the individual into more of like a um sort of a predetermined mechanism as opposed to a sort of a free
yeah oh yeah without without a doubt
yeah maybe not co confining
yeah
yeah yeah
mm hmm mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm mm hmm
mm hmm mm hmm
mm hmm
mm mm hmm mm hmm yeah
um did you wanna comment craig
yeah
yeah
fully agree
yeah

yeah
yeah got the email
yeah
yeah in it
mm hmm mm hmm mm hmm exactly
yeah i mean if you
yeah i mean sort of taking upon that idea w the way i see this i is that it's uh the
the s the structure in which we've we've approached this whole task is quite contrary to the p principle of
teamwork because the the tasks were d d sort of um divided
and then the work went on in isolation i i don't know what you guys did while you were together maybe that was a bit different
but um yeah but um but actually if you if you imagine not entire the
completely same task given to us but us said okay first thing we have to do is come up with um
let's say um a design concept and we sit here together and do it well that's what teamwork is to
s to say okay go off and don't talk to each other it's actually p sort of predisposes you to quite
the contrary of teamwork um not that we haven't done i think the best we could have done i'm not dissatisfied
with it
mm hmm
i think the whiteboard for me is the kind of thing i would use all the time but it's um
not quite as useful as to us as it could have been maybe just in the way that we we use it in the sense that once we have an idea
out there or while work was going on in between meetings that could have been up on a board
uh you know as opposed to in like in text
um and then we could then keep our ideas sort of building on that i know that people who design cars and you
know in aviation they quite often just have a simple like fibreglass prototype and it's completely you
know um abs abstract from the final product but they use it as a kind of a context to sort of walk around and puzzle and
and point and discuss and and and in a way everybody's as we discuss things in the in theoretically and out of our notebooks
we're just we're actually just each of us discussing something that's in each of our own minds it wasn't until we had this here you know like at one point i peeked across and looked at craig's paper and i'm like now i know what he's thinking 'cause i saw his book
but the b the b whiteboard could've actually been this kind of continuing um
think could be yeah
yeah yeah
yeah
yeah yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah
yeah yeah
yeah because the powerpoint was provided to us while we had time to prepare whereas i can imagine if i'd been encouraged
to use paintbrush for example or whatever i would've actually used it um
'ca you know just 'cause that's sorta how we what we were set up to to use while we had our time
mm hmm
yeah
no not quite
yeah
yeah
yeah
sure yeah
yeah
yep
mm
mm
yeah
hmm
hmm
mm hmm mm hmm hmm
mm hmm mm hmm mm hmm

and o on the topic of the technology it just occurred to me that we actually didn't need to move our computers because each computer has all of the files
it just occurred to me that they all
we only actually needed one computer
if there had been a fifth that coulda just been sitting there ready to go the whole time
yeah
yeah
yeah

mm hmm yep
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
well the w main one for me is that uh the process
na in a natural f context would not have been interrupted by this necessity to discommunicate ourselves from each other
so that's kind of a new idea for me is like just sort of that idea well you know it's kind of s hard to keep f working forward on a team a team based project when when you're told you must now work away from your team
oh yeah
yeah yeah
mm hmm mm hmm mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
hmm
great so it
so now we
i i don't know
hmm
what did you call it
huh huh logo
huh
mm
mm hmm
fashion technology or something
hmm hmm hmm
hmm
yeah yeah
mm hmm
hmm

huh
huh
yeah
yeah
no it's true yeah
hmm
and some play dohs are actually i think edible aren't they
wow hmm
huh
yep
taste
yeah
mm hmm yep yeah
yeah
mm hmm mm hmm mm hmm
mm hmm
do we retreat to our to continue our
r reporting or what i


uh oh this is it um there are a few changes we've
made um well look at the expense sheet and uh it turned to be quite a lot expensive
to have open up and have lots of buttons and stuff inside so instead we've um this is gonna be an l c d  screen
um just a a very very basic one very small um with access to the menu through the the scroll wheel and uh
confirm
um button uh apart from that it's just pretty much the same as we discussed last time

you know just like right inside there
well we want the other buttons to be big enough to push easily with a finger so we reckon maybe that'll be about the same size as the palm of your hand
well i'm
we're gonna have again the the sort of the foggy um yellow from last time that lit up when you pushed the button
um
but um this button um because it's red it's sort of very prominent we're
gonna use it as uh it can be the power button if you hold it for maybe two seconds it'll send a stand by signal
um apart from that it's gonna be used as a confirm button for the l c d  screen and you use this as a jog dial
i don't know

didn't put five centimetres
um
something by there
um you can skip straight to a channel using these buttons
um were gonna have the volume control here but um because we've got the the l c d  and the jog dial we just thought we'd um use that as the volume
um you can use it for um more advanced functions like contrast colour and
um yeah
um just whatever else we wanted to include as the advanced functions um we didn't actually go through and specify the
uh what can a t v  do
um
the the balance hmm
mm hmm
yeah
um i think single would just be sort of one sort of oval whereas double is this sort of thing
um we have um got some push buttons as well
'kay
so i reckon we've got one button for this thing 'cause it's just one big sheet of rubber
i'm not sure if that counts but
you can see we're we're all very far beyond the

well we could take out ones by making it single curved just fill in those bits
that is one
that's fair enough yeah
that's um one piece of rubber but it's gonna have twelve button things underneath so
yeah w
um

so i reckon
reckon that probably counts as a special form for the buttons
i think there's just one button so handy
yeah
you see i envision it as being um quite deep sort of deep enough to be comfy to hold in your hands rather than being wide and flat

yeah it works yeah
see about that thick
yeah
is it

yeah
i'm seeing five then
one's high ish isn't it
ah okay so yeah two or three

eight three
yeah

yeah one
yeah i think it's about five
yeah well we have to use uh plastic so it's probably gonna be
i think i'd probably increase the cost we've only got like what ten cents left so
yeah





my leg
um i agree with his point it's um it is quite a lot of fun t to go and then you have sort of hit the end then go right gotta cut everything out 'cause we don't have enough money
uh reckon that was a bit hard because we could only discuss things in the meeting
if we could just go up to somebody outside the meeting and have a quick talk with them that would've been a lot easier
not just yet
yeah
oh they're a bit clunky

good point
yeah
is this for the project or


oh yeah
do we know what the other ones are
oh wow
hey yeah i said ninja homer


guess i'd forgot how good s play doh smells
i think they're all non toxic 'cause it's aimed for like two year olds

yeah it's not very tangible
great thank you yep
sorry mm yep
yeah
uh yes course of course it is yeah
yeah
yeah i think it all is yeah i think it is all m one name yep
yeah these are s s species ions again not individual lines

it's not a competition uh
yeah and this one
um
mm hmm
yeah
well it's one of them out um over here i think actually at the moment so 'cause our sun is a is a t  dwarf
mm hmm
uh
well it's a process though isn't it
isn't it a process
yeah
yeah yeah i wouldn't have that

well i think y bu y y you can actually mark it if it isn't altering what's in the manual uh um it's only altering earlier rules
that aren't allowed
yeah then then do i think
yeah
yeah
y yeah yeah but yeah
yeah
just a p what are you doing there there sorry
yep isn't remote yeah fine
um yeah that's actually marked ex explicitly in here not to have a  bar clusters so yeah
no i i'm i'm not arguing i agree yeah
do you want this one here
no conti continuum no okay
i think that's a s species again
yeah i think you have
yeah well n i think i would actually leave it um with only th on those
br broad l
line in it um because i think that's s what you have been doing earlier on
yeah yeah
no
the difference only weak line isn't it
oh yeah there's a line there as well it's different
and an and different as well
they just made that up that's yeah exactly that's not a source type
that's we did earlier anyway so
no they just made that up as well no
that's a process though
yeah it's a process or a source
i'm sorry
yeah
well hang on though but wasn't there one just a minute ago in which only had a line
but you just
keeping lines there so
adjective uh yes right okay okay okay yeah okay fine
yeah
yeah that has to go as well then surely
a star burst is a class
as is an a g n 
yeah yeah okay
yeah
um are they uh if you say so okay
okay
well you haven't been earlier have you
i don't think you were uh
have you oh okay okay
yeah
okay
yeah i think so
uh
no
high velocity clouds there that's right
why
y yes that's right
yeah yeah that's right uh
really
if it was
are you n
no
no
nor weak emission then
no

oh yeah sorry yeah
no
yeah
yeah
um m uh y ye well i don't know
yeah but
hmm that's the actually usually but anyway i don't mind
yeah i gue i guess keep it then yeah i think so
blended ion lines yeah yes you do mean ion lines yeah
no
yeah it's if it has
h h
hydrogen or h helium in the atmosphere of white dwarfs yeah
no that's right that all goes
yeah i guess you could keep it then
yeah
but it's a region though isn't it
ye ye
the n  as well uh yeah
right
yeah
well kind of it it's uh uh d if you had a s sp spectrum you have all the
l lines of actually lots of different elements and you have to work out at
all the ones sp which are ion lines then after that you look and say um ha
has a lot of ion in it um
but b yeah i
that's right it's it yeah
yeah i think so
yeah i think so
i think so yeah
really really you think
okay if you both think so yeah
yeah okay okay
yeah i think so
yeah
well hang on though but um
is it just um to s scrub your mechanism there it isn't uh a spectral feature such as oh it's a process
mm hmm
mm hmm
i think it's a process myself
yeah well that's true that is true
yeah
yeah okay okay
i guess keep it probably yeah
no they've made that one up certainly i've never heard of that one before
no
yeah that's right yeah i wouldn't yeah
i think all of that goes then doesn't it
surely no
no i don't think anybody goes
yeah
mm no
it's an instrument yeah
yeah that's right
that's it hurray
well very good
yeah yeah

i think that's it isn't it we're done right
smile for the camera

helium one i think there should be a break for and but i think maybe that one should be underlined

helium
m b d a  presumably is lambda
and the in that case yep

yep
right what's different just this high excitation emission lines
i think high excitation should be in because it's just saying
it's talking about the species that the emission lines are coming from
living up in nebulosity
eso i don't think is an instrument
okay
to not yes to keep hubble um for this that should be green as well
well it is the whole name yes i get
absorption line systems shouldn't be there absorption line systems
and again

needs column densities which is a derived property
but then
mm hmm
and lyman alpha cloud shouldn't be in there either
right
no for some reason i seem to have just died on this one he got bored
you're right there
yes
i've labelled that wrong
and here again

um it is but is emission line a g n  a separate class from a g n 
i don't think it is i think a g n 
you wouldn't talk about
but i don't think you'd particularly class them as a separate source a separate source class
maybe you would
mm i didn't it i just looked at the plu
and i guess there is a difference between uh an a g n  with emission lines and one without esp especially if it's x  ray detected so yeah i'm happy with that as long as that's red as well which it is um

no oh galactic stars
i think you're r you're right again there
g  dwarf presumably never met one but don't know what it is
right oh is it there you go
and cluster you're right
absorption
but it's the same lyman alpha forest systems again so you're right there
or there maybe there shouldn't be any yeah i think should still be absorption
radio loud quasar again you're right
i should definitely now we had a debate about this before and i can't remember why i decided to mark associated um what does it mean
what is as associated absorption
doesn't say it's associated with what
i don't know i've got no idea what it means
yeah
right okay so is that what it means in that c context right um and associated again

mechanisms
quasar
and we should've s put emission line features shouldn't we
but we're not supposed to mark things we've done differently so
we've just talked about n und underlining features
it doesn't say in the manual about features or not but we d when we saw ones previously we marked features
um yes the only problem it's done if we've both been not marking it there might be other instances in the text where it's not marked
mm hmm
right okay yeah
yes we've got quasars and this is exactly the same as last one
systems
i m  galaxies
is it okay
hubble deep fields is being marked and absorption shouldn't be marked yep
i don't think able cluster is different from cluster hmm
an able cluster is just a a discover
yeah
soft excess
yep okay we can have soft excess mm hmm
and yes you're wrong 'cause that's you're right 'cause that's extended emission and compton emission
i think you're right on both of them

um x  ray b l x  and radio b l x  i think are because the b l  within should be marked so
no continuum
c o  luminosity
mm hmm
oh it's still too hot

um
intermediate is a region
it shouldn't be highlighted you're right
because if if we talk about the broad line region we're not supposed to highlight it it's the same it's just it's not very clear before the so called
um
yeah just galaxies
star bursts yes they do
oh yes assuming you're talking about star burst galaxies rather than star burst within a galaxy but they are talking about star burst galaxies

and galaxies
mm continua or continuum flux
it's another one of those that doesn't really make a big difference but what did we decide
let's keep flux in because it in most of these cases we've put flux in
and the same as feature
broad line
i was gonna say put it in um the lack of broad line polarization broad line polarization is that a spectral feature i think you'd want the whole thing in some extent
ts you can't get it just from a spectrum
but you can if you've got a spectrum that's split by polarized light
as it is
polarization's a property yes okay
yep
now i d don't know what was marked here have you got the bottom of this page or is it cut off
no i said that weak line was because the modifier should be included which i think it should even though we claim radio galaxies i this should be underlined this should be green
oh right okay are we the same on the bottom line
okay so the question is oh no it's different oh i've got line that's fine line comes out and and should come out as well
so there's a right but i think weak line should be in
bec i in the same way that if you had broad line it would be in there
right
yes
mm okay
um line again
but we've got emission line in the ratios that's fine infrared galaxies that's right again oh no is it no it's wrong yeah
i'll get this
line
and that's it
making emission feature which we're including now
mm hmm
star forming galaxies
no we can't star forming galaxies should be in
yeah proto galactic lump w not gonna get away with that one it's a lump it's something emission feature again
damp lyman
that should be because it's not an absorber it's an absorption oh covers yeah
yeah you cross 'em out features
a feature again
is a feature a spectral feature damped lyman alphas again
yeah
after and the rest is the same
now a line should be in
x  ray b  l 
intermediate
we put in type type one point nine yes i think it should be in


mm hmm oh gosh this looks complicated oh it's just it's lyman alpha absorption
and we don't like that one
and we don't like that one
yes we are taking out line on its own so we ha yes
every time
yes i think we have to take in general every time there's been line where's there been line
okay it's line width but it's st it's still where it says lines have we had any just where it says line ratios
mm
yes i think you're right
no we want the whole thing in there
or in the u v  i don't think spectrum should be there but if it's a wave length or a wave band we were putting it in
yeah
yep you're right
line centre you can point to not like line width but you can point to line centre in fact the whole thing should be highlighted i think
you can point to the line wings
mm that's just a
yep no that shouldn't be in there
mm you're right star burst oh star burst active star burst like activity that's i don't think that's a class
it's a action
but a  g but a an a  an a g n  is a class
a star burst is a type of galaxy but it's also something that can happen within a galaxy it's
but an a g n  is an object the star burst you can't say here is a star burst
can't star burst if it means galaxy if this means star burst galaxy like activity then that's fair enough
but star burst refers to
mm
i can see that
mm hmm
okay let's keep it in i i think you're right anyway mm hmm yes i think it was ma maybe
if it was star forming like activity that would be different but yeah yes that's right but star burst is different
okay um we've just got this split up i think there should be w h 
you're right it's two
it's a wave length region but it's tilt but you're saying between that line and that line
um
you are yes that's all part of the name
line ratios
but galaxy should be in
so we need to write that
um hold on
oh no they are the same sorry i missed that
absorption line systems hubble and hubble and galaxy
galaxy distribution
still the distribution of galaxies
um high ionization lines yes
mm hmm
open that radius button
yes don't include platt's spectrum
quasars
low ionization mm but three should be in
um low ionization th they're low bals aren't they
low bal is a separate class of source
um i i don't know if high bals are but low bals are
oh right yeah yeah
i shouldn't you're right there
emission line candidates
yes you're right
continuum i think should be in aren't they although i was talking about conti yeah continuum luminosity continuum flux it should be in
i thought we had we'd put in

mm hmm
yeah we weren't doing broad band detections we were doing yeah
this is nice tea

now what were we doing if
it
and what were we doing
um
i don't know 'cause you in language speak mark each as a separate entity that's different
mark sub sections of entities t no that's different doesn't really say
so we need a rule for that
what have we done t
z  equals two
yeah
as one okay
let's whatever's easiest for you y um yes take it out isn't it the spectral components
x  ray binaries
hubble deep field again
emission line objects shouldn't be in either of them
radio quiet quasar should be go mm
i think that's right
now you've done one and not the other and you're right because one's line formation and one's line profile
i g m  i've done again
this is nice and easy

components
um
mm hmm but we want the line still
the galaxy or galaxy given that it is the galaxy
it should be the galaxy i guess insert proper whatever the word is

h v c  is it this
known to lie in the direction of high velocity clouds that's where they are they shouldn't be in there

yes but they don't explain i c m 
scuba
sometimes anyway when it works
um
no but no you're right and this should be red as well it should all be narrow line a g n  are different
i missed out that
h  beta l width so
just keep h  beta i think given that we're not putting line width itself even line if it is line width
you can have flux
h  beta should be in
not that line but we want enhanced
we we wanted and this is relative we wanted modifiers of modifiers of spectral lines e g  weak broad lines
i weak w relative to what though it's all relative but it's still a modifier of that line
and the same


um
no only when it's embedded oh but the second one oh it's included beside mark it all as one entity yes
yes i don't know how many times i've missed the
um weak emission i think should be in there
mm if we're including it emission
um
no that's true so we shouldn't have done either of those but then weak yeah okay nothing at all
that's not a separate source
red continuum should be in
broad line emission and the rest frame u v  should all be one
you're right yeah oh no it shouldn't
oh yes sorry you're right
lines
yes that's true
associated again which means nothing continuum source shouldn't be in
and associated shouldn't be in
c t i i o  what does it stand for
that is a separate thing
y yeah
yes but it's also a telescope and i think he if there's no other way of describing it that telescope
the c t i o  four metre telescope is must be what it's called otherwise they'd call it a name
um
we're including observatory if it refers
if it's part of the proper name of an instrument
yes up the telescope no just four metre
ion shouldn't be in there
oh no it should iron and absorption is it contamination from blended iron and absorption lines no it's not
it's no it's not i if the comma wasn't there it would be in
so they do mean iron line so so it should be in
and we're keeping line in 'cause its strengths yeah
continuum flux we should have all in

g oh there're gonna be hundreds of those least it's quick um
i don't think that's a separate class of quasar but then i don't know about quasars
i think it should p
yeah that's okay um the a w d  s mm white dwarf um
okay so it is a different class okay
nope
low bal
mm i'd put multiple in there
we're not supposed to do components
i say neither of them
or yeah that's right
no absorption lines that should be highlighted oh sorry i'm i me
yeah i don't thin i don't think there was s but
mm only if it's an astro physically distinct distinct
okay
no absorption lines should be in and the same here
i didn't nice not to do associated for once
i you're
y yes you shouldn't
and we w oh gosh what were we gonna to do about a  and again
yes you are right yeah
strong soft x  ray flux
yeah you can point to that
and that's associated absorption lines
and absorption and small clouds is out

ah now this is the conjunct rule again and i've done blue wings of this and this and this
and this is one double line and this and presumably that's red there it goes over there i think i if the line's too long y you've highlighted all i as one but and i've highlighted it separately it should be separate
i think if the line's too long it's only ha putting the bottom line because olivia would've marked from blue all the way to the end as one long line
yes but i think it probably was and just hasn't printed because olivia wouldn't have started marking at fourteen o  two almo two lines above
yeah but i think it's just m missing out the printing if the line goes over the end 'cause if you look at you look at what olivia's done here olivia wouldn't have just highlighted that line she would have highlighted the whole thing
yeah and it's just hasn't printed that but it is marked i think
mm hmm
shouldn't be

but it's al is that also the name of the source
so it should be this one plus the pink

line broadness and i think that should be in
that's true well okay yeah so we've been in here alright
my table for now

rich iron spectrum
you're probably right to the feature of the spectrum does that make it a spectral feature um
it's a feature of the whole spectrum rather than you can't say there is a rich iron spectrum you can say this is a rich iron spectrum
yes it's not a spectral feature it's feature of the spectrum which is different
yes
and then with the same
gosh we're getting through this now um giant ellipticals or ellipticals
we were inclu are you not
they are separate but are they a separate class i think they probably are in the eta b t g s and things

ionized emission
yes i think you want ionized in there
you can point to ionized emission rather than
hmm emission from high excitation lines yeah it it's pointing there and saying look there's a high excitation emission and there's not high excitation
k
mm hmm
line ratio
what's different there oh there yes
narrow line seyfert one should all be one with the red inside it
that
yeah
it's describing the line you're looking for
we've included it before when you've said this has been detected

from i think should be in there
e emission lines
quasars i missed
damped lyman also is not systems yeah
mm no i think it's a spectral feature you can point to the damped lyman a alpha resorption in in the same way you can point to h  beta emission although h  beta emission is a process or emission from h  beta is is a process
no the damped lyman alpha absorption systems we crossed out we also crossed out
what did we do back
mm you can point to low red shift damped lyman alpha absorption 'cause you're shifted in the spectrum there
um
would it be if it was h  beta absorption
and you just took out the low red shifts quasars with h  beta absorption you'd put in
because it's a spectral feature i think damped lyman alpha absorption
i think it's both
because we've every feature is produced by a process
yes it's depends whether it has t whether it means with low red shift damped lyman alpha cloud absorption
if it was damped lyman alpha absorbers that would be different but i think absorption
it's a process but it also produces a spectral feature where you can say there's the damped lyman alpha absorption there's the in the same way that the yeah h  beta emission is a process yeah i think it should be in there
micro quasars they're dubbed micro quasars
is it gonna be a decent source type in the future
i haven't heard referred to since but
but just talk about the micro quasar
yeah i think you're right they have ma
mm on the other hand if we're having hyper luminous galaxies where you know they've just got ultra luminous and oh even more hyper luminous well someone must have made that up for the first time
i think
same as a hyper luminous galaxy being very very extreme
i reckon a dwarf amorphous nuclei star burst galaxy a dance is a
yeah okay but what about the acronym because that's has that should be in
star burst nuclei
you're right oh
the object
if it was star burst galaxies it would be in there
star burst nuclei refers to a region within an object which would not be observed separately um
okay
because the acronym has star burst in it uh galaxies in it in the s  and if the acronym includes its
then it has to be in there
continuum flux you can have
u v  and optical emission line ratios but
u v  and optical emi u v  and optical emission should be in there though no it shouldn't 'cause it it modifies the ratios
oh gosh no emission l okay so i've highlighted this in r red and then the whole thing in green because type two seyfart galaxies are one so i think that's right as long as this is

t v  gamma ray emission
we weren't doing broad band detections yeah using the it is yes very stupid but it is
f b s  objects shouldn't be in there
i don't know but it's got object
and the mama scanning machine is an instrument it's not a telescope it's an instrument

oh yes it should be
narrow emission lines from high iron yeah
absorption features
weak continuum that should be separate
continuum radiation
neither
mm hmm
yep
oh there's emission from the narrow line region yeah
narrow line emission should be in
  f v  low bal is a source type stupid keckers you used
to b oh no keck observatory yes we did decide keck was going in
at all yep and we shouldn't allow emission
radio quasars yeah oh no radio loud and radio quiet are
yeah
mm hmm


um
ye i think they're a separate class yes we're not putting them in spectral but i think we are putting them in because it's so broad band but yes they are separate

no you can't point to it yeah
missed group
subaru telescope you're right
it's under a proper name 'cause it's got a capital t 
wonderful

well once we've got them identified a lot of them were the same problem going round and round um where's the bin in here
and more to the point can i get to it without going ah i can carry my little bits in the with me excuse me camera
i need to find the bin um and there isn't one is there
hello
right
mm mm hmm

yeah it's hard to know what that is that's this is a bit of h t m l  goo
i think there should be a break for and
and they don't know what to do with the h t m l  goo
but this this isn't a s yeah and this isn't a separate thing so i w i would agree that you underline the you underline the goo in each case but not the and right
yeah
okay
mm mm hmm
mm
yes yeah yeah
okay
right you don't get that

eso isn't an instrument you're right
we agreed for to keep hubble yep
yeah that should be a source type yeah
it's
yeah do you think that's part of the name yeah i don't yeah i have no way of knowing yeah
yep
yep
right

mm yeah
yep that's fine

nope


i win uh
okay
yeah i know is there a prize at the end bottle of champagne um okay
mm that's a spectral feature that's okay
ye
emission line a g n  you can get a g n  without emission lines
i think in phil's paper he does doesn't he the paper i pointed you to a few weeks ago or last week
i didn't know what he meant but yes i've seen people talk about them as separate classes but i don't really know what that means
yeah
yep
oh
mm 'kay
yeah that g  dwarfs are things aren't they that's alright yeah


i saw it yesterday uh yeah
there he is
by lyman alpha forest and lyman limit systems
yeah okay
yeah
mm hmm
emission models definitely not um why associated
yeah
it means it's associated with some physical thing but it doesn't have anything to do with the spectral features i don't think does it
mm hmm
i'm happy to say m  two what not absorption is a spectral feature but associated means it's associated to some physical thing so yeah so that shouldn't be in
alright
yep
those are mechanisms so they don't count don't think
um
yep i just missed it
and that's it
hmm yeah we should do
yeah we did that the same but it's different from what we've been doing
yeah
yeah and it's not in the manual is it
yeah so let's do that extend
mm hmm
okay
yeah

yep
it's a kind of a regular galaxy
mm hmm
yeah
ri right
that definitely gets to go in
that's not a component i think yeah we could come to blows over soft excess
okay
yeah
okay


yeah i agree that's fine
no
no for continuum um
yeah that's fine


uh i can agree with taking that out

that the so called yeah i don't think it should be should it 'cause it's a region yeah
yep
yeah it's badly written
infrared galaxies we said not to mark things based solely on
so it's just defined only by wave length so we can't include infrared galaxies
and
star bursts count surely
mm yes yeah they are
galaxies
mm
it doesn't really matter i'd say continuum flux but i don't obviously but i don't care yep okay
mm hmm
mm no i'm happy to take that out oh
mm no you can't point to it

yeah
yeah

okay
okay
mm
uh we're missing weak weak line i don't oh y so they're saying weak line radio galaxies are a separate class of radio galaxy
okay yeah
okay
right
oh yeah no you've got line in there
m
and should come out
okay mm hmm
yep that's okay
galactic black hole candidates
yeah
yeah i don't think that's a source type
mm mm hmm
yep
no it's not right right

uh line emitting gas i don't like yeah
far infrared galaxies we can't have
that's okay
yeah that's okay
damped lyman alpha absorption the same right yep emission feature
yeah that can't be in
yep
uh yes it should be yep that should be in
that is not a source type
what were you thinking yeah dibulae absorption
no but it says it covers a significantly small angular size it's a physical thing

yep uh this feature yeah okay
alpha yeah you don't get that do you
those are those are regions globs nebulae
yep
yeah
x  ray b l  lax yep that's okay
intermediate types it now if we're d
did we in the end yeah oh right you get it then
that doesn't go in and that's okay
right that's okay we don't like systems
yeah that's okay
are we
okay yep
what line are we taking out
line width yeah
line ratios we've been taking out line as a
word that relates to other words my head is going yeah but lines are still lines yeah that's okay

right i agree that that can go out 'cause that's a fitting thing
absorption features in the u v  spectra
okay
it's likely one spectrum in the u v  which you can see absorption features in uh right quasars quasars
uh huh yeah i'm right and here i think i'm right again
line centre
yeah you'd you'd say line wings alright you get it
right you win um eclipsing i don't think
yeah you're right there
y yeah but then the a g n  like activity
so both of them have to go a star burst is a class
an a g n 
but we're counting star bursts as star burst galaxies
no but a star burst galaxy is only a galaxy which has a star burst in it like an a g  an active galaxy is just a galaxy with an a g n  in it
yeah
i think they're the same they either have to both stay or both go and i i think they should stay
yeah star formation we weren't putting in

that
or was it's a wave length region yeah yeah yeah okay
i'm right here that's part of a name yeah
mm 'kay
infrared galaxies this time you have it but galaxies should be in
right
uh oh what have we done

hubble
yeah ok i in the galaxy distribution
yeah okay
mm
yeah we did it before
yeah that's okay
oh
yeah okay
we weren't doing spectral shapes were we
yeah that counts
mm hmm
well
yeah that's true
that counts
they are and it's a big joke high balls uh yeah
um next
yeah
yeah that doesn't go in that means objects that are identified and maybe at a particular red shift based on it yeah that doesn't count
mm continuum luminosities
i don't remember about luminosities we've been putting in continuum flux
yeah
mm
mine too oh
radio loud quasar should be in z  equals two shouldn't the rule was to leave it in was it
yeah that's for things marked with and
yeah it doesn't say
z  equals two is um means at a certain distance um so that shouldn't be in but radio loud quasars is a thing so it's whether to include the z  equals two in the
yeah
oh
no
yeah
no
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm no we can't have that
yep
a source type
yeah
oh
yeah um right pause filler 
yes um yeah
yeah
we can rid of that can't we
galaxy with the galaxy
it should be the galaxy yeah
h v c  complexes i don't know what h v c  stands for but since they're complexes we can cross it out huh do you know what h v c  stands for
yeah that doesn't count
mm hmm
scuba that's an instrument
you're right there should be this and it probably is that's probably what that means
oh i see yeah
right
beta line
i don't think that matters very much
okay
hurray
um oh beta yep
mm no
do we
but enhanced relative to what
okay
but when yeah
oh i don't think i was doing that
yeah i've missed that a lot
yeah okay
oh yeah extended emission is extended we we've not been including extended emission so
yeah
weak emission levels is just a way of saying yeah i agree done

star burst contribution
yeah that's true
red continuum okay
yeah

yeah that should be out
we weren't doing components so
yeah this is this a radio transfer thing so they don't mean they mean photons in the lines escape
not that that's not something you can point to i don't think that counts
mm
uh uh
mm that should be oh wait is that s that's an observatory isn't it the c t  is the c t i o  four metre uh the name of that telescope
no
and the a a t  is an observatory as well isn't it so
yeah
but we if we put
yeah
but then we have to include four metre as well
no yeah
right
yep i agree mm hmm
what is that comma doing there yeah no oh i see i see i see yeah accounting for galactic reddening contamination from blended iron what they mean is blended iron lines
yeah
continuum fluxes yeah we're doing that yeah
no uh yeah damped lyman alpha q s o 
uh i don't know what that means either one damped lyman alpha q s o s
it's not a source type that's definitely true
so
what's d a 
and there's w d s
it's twenty five of d a  type and six of d b  type
yep
yep
yes you're fine with that

nope
okay
yeah
no luminos
yeah low luminosity q s o s no people talk about them a lot but
well we're doing ultra luminous galaxies so we should do
yeah people discuss them as a separate class
they are as as much as ultra luminous galaxies are
and yep that should be in

excellent
regions i shouldn't have done that
oh a  and b 
no that's the conjunctural i'm right here i think if yeah
yeah that's okay
uh
oh right in the a a l  outflow it's a r yeah that doesn't count
it doesn't count

and i didn't ooh how do you know what's going on here
yeah
yeah
yeah i don't know what this means oh i highlighted all as one right
okay yeah
the n  should be yeah yeah
mm hmm
yeah
oh i see so your n  starts yep yep i see what you mean
mm
so n  probably should be highli
yep
absorption components don't count
continuum source does that count shouldn't be
mm oh so it is that's right
probably yeah
yep
uh line broadness
that's a way of saying line width though and we don't mark line width
oh

rich iron spectrum
yeah
mm
yeah
yep that's the rich iron spectrum i agree let's get rid of it
yeah
yeah yeah
right that's not shouldn't go in
is that everything yeah okay
yeah yeah we aren't gonna make it to our second cookie break
i don't mind
are giant ellipticals separate things i don't know
yeah okay
line emitting gas doesn't get in
if you're doing emission from high yeah

hmm
well she
she was allowed emission from high excitation what not and that's exactly the same yeah that's exactly the same as
no
well i'm not certain if high excitation should go in but if high excitation should go in i think ionized means the same thing doesn't it so
yeah you're right you've got x  ray source r  one seventeen

mm hmm
no that's
this is describing the band you do the observations in
yeah that counts alright
right okay
s
s yeah okay yep
yep
ooh those shouldn't be there should they
no
oh okay okay okay
ne yes
i think this is what we agreed to cross out before isn't it
i think it's a process too i think
especially when uh they're saying we're y we're choosing low red shift absorption that's not really something you can point to
mm i'm not too fast i don't think
mm no i'm not sure
it's whether it's a process or a a feature but i can't remember what we've done before
well if it was if it was absorption and damped lyman alpha clouds you'd not mark absorption
i do think it's a process i think
hmm mm
well we've both marked it so let's leave it there
micro quasars
yeah that means it's new fangled
yeah
yeah but they've made up that word
yeah
but w do they what defines a micro quasar
but


uh yeah you y there's not been more than one study of dwarf amorphous nuclear star burst galaxies so that do we say we take that out
yep that's it in it so that's okay yep
oh
oops
yep that's fine


mm hmm
yeah
we wouldn't have line ratios so yeah that goes
yeah no it modifies ratios
mm
right yep that's fine
plus red yeah
we weren't doing broad band detections right
that's definitely an instrument name
right you're right there
what does it mean
yep you're right
yeah okay so you can have that
right at the other one we stopped after four metre so maybe we should do that there as well

yeah we did it this way before
yeah you're right
continuum radiation
no neither
narrow line region emission uh do you th i think that goes out yeah we don't
yep
uh yep white dwarfs is a source type
yeah you're right it is uh
keck is yeah
uh we didn't allow iron spectrum so we shouldn't allow h  or helium two o  spectrum either
yeah
iso electronic
yeah
radio quasars are s type
but radio quasars means radio loud quasars
u v  accessors are right isn't it it's a spectral feature
we weren't doing flat spectrum quasars were we
no
were we
right

right uh you're right there
line strengths
means equivalent widths yeah
uh i did mis group
yep
hey excellent
yeah

hurray we're done excellent
yeah
no you can't
oh
do we each remain wired up are we done
excellent
cheers
it should be this one here
do you reckon this stands for lambda or yeah okay

i forgot to keep track of the overall score like who wins and who lose
mm hmm
well w within the sentence that you sort of currently looking at um feel free to correct it that way that you'll do you know like it's not only about resolution but it's sort of like coming up with a corrected version based on these yeah
have you do you've seen that there are the other one there the quasar right the uh right sorry
mm hmm
oops no
or actu actually sorry i think um the um this cut up page continues in the next side yeah characterised by unusually
no is it
hmm
yeah
and give it an acronym g b h c  ooh
get this out of the way

hmm
mm hmm
wait fr from the linguistic side if you if you mark star burst before and if you feel that star bursts are like objects then i think it sh it should stay in in this case even though it's modified by activity or it's it's m modifying activity actually
hmm
is is goo again or is it really z  equals two
mm hmm
alright
mm hmm
if it was radio loud quasar then you would mark it as one thing
i i think it makes sense to um mark the whole thing then as one i don't know what you feel but
um so sorry and the the a g n  i think that should be one entity right the the uh w wasn't it that according to the uh acronym rule the first one
mark the la la mark the whole string as one entity one acronym
mm hmm
mm hmm mm
mm hmm
what what's this n  thing because that is not marked in the
no sorry i mean the um so so most the
right
hmm yeah
but yeah but it's s so you're mostly settling uh settling for for the uh solution where you mark all contacts individually
right
something that you can point to right or
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
oh i see
so in that sense it's like like a derived property yeah i see uh huh
mm hmm mm hmm
mm
hmm

sorry what what happened now so you you f you found that dwarf amorphous blah blah galaxies that that's not a proper name but you still include the acronym or
oh okay alright okay i see mm hmm
hey wow

under two hours amazing
yeah

i th i think so yeah
okay hi team hope you had a good lunch okay we're back for the conceptual design meeting um let's get started
'kay here is the agenda for today's meeting um we're gonna open it and i'm gonna keep the minutes
as project manager we're gonna have three presentations one from each of you again and then we are going to come to decision on
the remote control concepts and then we're gonna close it up and we have forty minutes again
'kay and just to reiterate um after this meeting the team will reach a decision on the concepts of the remote control
okay let's go ahead and start off with your presentations who would like to go first
okay um courtney would you mind starting us off okay
trend watching
'kay
mm 'kay

mm mm
right yes
right
right people don't buy a new remote every so often
okay
hmm
very good i like it okay ready for the next slide
op mm 'kay
great great presentation
ready
'kay
which one is it

interface concepts new
y
'kay
sorry
oh okay
oh there we go

sure
mm 'kay
mm
mm
okay


okay
'kay
no
mm or i like you know the black finish or the silver finish or whatever
good lord okay ready oh yeah okay
great job
okay
what's the title
got it
hmm
interesting


mm
'kay
no okay
mm
hmm okay alright well thank you for those informative presentations let's go back to um now we have to make some decisions
where were we
sure

mm
right right
mm
hmm
programme
if it's within our price to get that kind of chip that would you know technology
hmm
mm
hmm
okay that kind of brings us to this let's let's see if we can decide what kind of energy source we want to have first and foremost um
do we wanna go for batteries or a stand like the one that we saw illustrated earlier
the base the charging base with rechargeable batteries
hmm
yeah and we don't have multiple things that it has to control it just has to control the t v  it's not gonna be a huge universal remote
what size battery and
right i agree it's either gonna be bigger with a base or smaller with just
a battery like this guy alright so what direction do you want to go in you wanna vote
i'm kind of i'm kind of leaning in the direction of this kind of
bigger and the base that just seems so clunky and
okay

hmm

okay so what kind of material do we want to be made out of
no oh what did you oh sorry go ahead
right what would you recommend
mm
i i think we should just focus on one design and one concept right now i'm not sure that we'll have the time and money to produce a whole array of
remotes if this was a successful remote we might then produce a higher end version of it i think
okay so we wanna go for plastic or what would you recommend for materials
hmm

mm hmm
mm
okay
they could buy cases maybe
if they wanted i think it's good to sell a basic thing and then sell
options
okay okay
right right
okay and what kind of chip would we need for this guy
i don't think we should do voice i think we should just do um the recognition for when it's lost you know could we yeah
hmm
right

oh dear
okay
okay alright but it's not gonna be voice activated in the fact that you would say channel up and it would work right just a okay alright
no
mm 'kay
uh and what size batteries double a  triple a 
two
could it run off of two
they're more expensive though too
mm
thoughts anybody
okay yeah alright
okay
so we've covered that first category user interface concept meaning design
okay i ki i kind of like your idea about the retro phone dial and that the central button could have maybe our logo on it
it might be the four way scroll too i mean if yeah
yeah
mm hmm
mm
yeah
oh i see what you mean
i think so
yeah i like that 'kay
mm
can we
so that you're just not holding it and it changes the chan
mm yeah
hmm
'kay any other ideas
oh yeah latex covers w
i think maybe we should do it on a b button itself though because if people are able to change the covers i don't know maybe the on off button something some the menu button i don't know but you know if we're gonna put our company logo on there and somebody could just get
another one are they all gonna have our company logo on them every cover
yeah
if we want it to be visible and
um are all those those one that you showed where they were um s met silver metallic
looking but those are plastic right they're not titanium i kind of like that look
uh but or if it was really yeah for the base or if we're going for the retro look i think
like a really shiny black would be cool
what are your thoughts gun metal gray
there you go gun metal gray
why
mm
right
on the back it d visible visibility though 'cause if it was only on the back really the only time you're gonna see it is when you drop it or when you're changing the battery
i can find it again
okay and yours was called interface concept
this one well for some reason i can't get it to just go to that slide directly
mm
okay yes yes
okay
like a little cut out kind of
okay
anybody see anything that they liked in these ones
mm
mm
yellow i like that idea
mm
mm
i like the yellow illumination idea very good
okay
any other ideas or thoughts
we all seem to be fairly in agreement about what we wanna do with this project so
'kay
i think there will be time for that later i'm guessing
'kay well we're gonna wrap this up um next meeting is gonna start in thirty minutes
and here's what we're each of us going to do the i d  is going to do the look and feel design the u i d  the user
interface design i think you're going to get a lot of i mean the final say on what buttons get put we'll
all talk about it but i think that's pretty much what you're gonna do right
i guess 'kay and you're gonna do some product evaluation okay and right now the i d  and u i d  you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay
yeah okay and you should all be getting an email pretty soon alright well thank you for a very productive meeting
just trying to move mine right now
they want everything but simply okay

yeah th
i i can
i can address some of that issue i think with uh my presentation
okay
mine will always read copy of something or other i i copied mine before i sent it over
hmm
okay my turn
whoo
it'll be copy of component design
yeah th that looks like it
'kay so basic remote operation runs as follows press button makes connection
with the power source and the rest of the circuit chip senses the connection chip produces a morse code infra red signal
specific to that button so you press the button it produces uh a signal that's encoded specifically
for that button transistors amplify that signal and it goes to the t v 's centre which interprets the signal
response accordingly changes channel etcetera so that being said next slide please
findings oh which were the required materials for the basic internal construction so all the really
simplistic functions that we just discussed we need rubber for buttons aluminium for battery y contacts
integrated circuit which consists of a diode transistor resonator resistors and a capacitator
all those basic things that make a circuit function um fibreglass and thin copper wire to create the actual circuit
board itself
an l e d  which is a light emitting diode um contact discs for the buttons
plastic for the casing and a power source whatever power source we've actually determined we want
next slide please thank you uh personal preferences uh to save money for the components the remote should
be mass produced and basic materials should be bought en masse um if we find another company who can
produce the required chips casing l e d  any additional materials we decide we require at a
less expensive rate than we ourselves are producing we should go for it
next slide please um just talking to the um manufacturing division
they suggested power options solar cells hand dynamo and kinetic power so you shake it
and it increases the power um i'm not sure how the hand dynamo works they have yet to get back to me on that
so next slide please suggested casing options okay we
can offer options for casing such as straight curved double curved you know very specific to the customer
options for materials plastic rubber titanium wood i don't think anyone's gonna go for a wood one because splinters
yeah um certain restrictions do apply here though uh latex you can't do solar power with a latex
one so if they want some a soft squishy rubber they can't have the solar powered option double curved
you can't do titanium um that would be two curvatures so it would actually if you the shape of your hand
you curve here and you curve here so you could have two curves that match the shape of your hand to make it more comfortable to hold
now if you wanted that you can't do titanium and uh so you functions what
for the buttons scrolling function could be very beneficial to us instead
of actual buttons themselves i think i have one more slide no i didn't
um the manufacturing division also has said that um they have several types
of chips and they've just developed a sample sensor or sample speaker chip
which we could utilise um push button requires a simple chip and scroll
requires more complicated chip so depends on what we decide we wanna do
in addition to that if we're offering all those different options to the customer for producing their remote
we're going to have to have multiples of each type like a double curved in rubber
um you know each option should have a certain select number produced
with all those options so we'll have to mix it up make sure we produce enough of everyone but
that could also drive up the price of the actual remote itself if they know that we only produced five thousand
you know double curved wooden remotes
and that's all i got
well we are making the chip so i mean
but i guess we have to look at w what our production cost is for the chip itself anyway yeah
yeah
i i thought offering some of those options for different materials that it could be made of different you know i think we'd have to decide on the power options maybe so that we could reduce cost yeah
okay
i think the p
that's true
if we do a voice activated locator though we're gonna be looking at a more substantial chip so
honestly i think the customer would be kind of irritated by the fact that it has a base if we did do a nice small compact
mm yeah
yeah
'kay so
the only problem with that is if you forget to take it out of your pocket and it goes in wash
you know it happens i've had three watches go that way too
pieces everywhere
well we have lots of options i don't think wood is a viable option
however well we only wanna sell it for twenty five euro right 'cause i was thinking if we wanted to get the high in market then you could produce a few in titanium make them a rarity so to speak
yeah
well the original
okay
yeah good plan
honestly i'd recommend like um uh since we're going with batteries instead of solar power i'd recommend
maybe a uh soft like latex because we could produce you know how cellphones
have those overlays that you can change the colour we could do uh one that fits in with the trends of the year
so because this year is all fruit god only knows why um we could
do f a cherry cover for this year and then i if next year is stripes or solids
you know
they could come back and buy the extra case
so we could do like a b a hard base plastic and then we could give
two latex covers to start
how complicated are we gonna go with the voice activated
well we could give it a specific code you know remote missing
yeah see that would just irritate me
so i think having a key phrase is much better
no
that would be like a mid class um yeah so we don't actually have to go for
well if they've just developed the sample sensor sample speaker it's a brand new chip why not introduce it in this way
i think well we could d r do two or we could do one small lithium 'cause
you know the lithium batteries are doing quite well in most other electronic products right
so they're more widely available now and they also have a longer battery life than most batteries
but if you only have to replace it every five years
well how about a initial you get one battery when you buy it 'cause i'm pretty sure we can get them pretty cheap on bulk yeah
in the sample ones that you showed us there was one that had the scroll buttons on the side which i think if
we make it curved like a hand like a hand shape like if we put the the scroll button on the side
that could be particularly useful
well if it's just up and down
volume or channel i don't know
mm yeah we should probably make it that you have to depress it to activate it then 'cause oth otherwise you're not just holding it and going like this you know
okay
we have to make sure that logo always sticks out when we put the latex covers on so we'll have to like have a little square or something so that the our logo's available
yeah i don't think we should do that because that would just be icky so i think maybe putting it on a button is probably a good idea
for our base one
it'll wear off
there's nothing saying that we have to put the logo on the front of the actual
the only problem is we're using a latex overlay so it actually would go over top of everything and have holes for the buttons so i was thinking maybe instead of doing that what we could do is leave a space for where the logo should be
yeah
great play doh
wonderful
ooh

okay hang on
see if it's there

i don't know hang on interface concepts no
either refresh it or it sh oh wait maybe i didn't put it there hang on
sorry hang on
don't know
okay
okay um looking at the interface concept it's gonna be mostly examples of possibilities of where we can go with this uh if you wanna start the next slide
um uh can't really see but there's two possible ways on the r left if you see on th on the sides of
of the remote you have the sort of scroll down so you have that option right there and then also there's the idea of the base
that's sort of like an idea there and then on the right we have what's really big trend
right now it's the ipod it's becoming really and so you have this sort of very very simplistic menu
section uh with the round buttons and it's sort of like you have the both kind of trendy and hip
but also very sleek and
um and very simple but technologically advanced so if you wanted to do that th if we could find a way of sort of like using that idea in a remote control then sort of
look into it but anyway next
um there's the idea of like being able to do it by feel as well as by um by sight you'd you
know you're in the dark you don't wanna be looking at the remote control and the picture particularly is pointing out if you look
at the top volume button it's a v  and so yo you're kind of feeling a v  like volume up
what it really is is a v  and what it you think it is is down because the down arrow and so it's
like a sort of a criticism you'd probably turn that o the other way up
um but then you have you could either do it by raised type which could be you know iffy
um sort of old fashioned in a way either that or just have it by shape for example you have a specific
triangular shape that you know you're looking at the up and down arrow and then the round ones you sort of feel by you know that's the second one
down that sort of thing so it's sort of looking into how we wanted t to do it by feel
okay
um this is sort of an example of going for a s certain demographic um this is particularly geared towards children
um it's very cute and we could probably change it to yellow bright yellow for like a the for the company
logo um and you have the shapes and it's very simplistic and friendly looking um
and then the other thing that it would be able to do is just to pro be ab you program certain
channels that only these children would watch so it's like they ch watch you know the c  beebies or something like that
uh keep them away from other channels
so that's like another ar um i mean these are three examples sort of looking at it you have the wider
section for the main controls there uh you could see how many buttons there are and then on the left you have an example
of the round buttons and a simpler design on the bottom we probably wouldn't need that
because it's more for like a d v d  function which we are not gonna be using um
so again it's sort of like just give you ideas and then down at the bottom you have the logos and that's where you could put the r r  real reaction
and then finally these are like the sort of same examples but also some more just possibilities that we could go with none of them i'm particularly keen on by the way
but it's sort of like just taking aspects out of that and saying well out of this one we like you know the round section of um b or we'd like the the button size on this
right

that's it

right
let me just add one more thing that i couldn't say before and that's just that there's the new technology that they've developed on the voice recognition
um
right except that it's sort of odd and i'm no not exactly sure why they are explaining it in the way they are
um there's a sample sensor and there's a sample speaker unit for so you would say like good morning
coffeemaker and it would respond good morning jill but
i'm not sure exactly how it's gonna work 'cause do you programme do we program the responses and the questions
so does that mean that the user then has to ask the specific question and can't change it
in order for it to be recognised or can it be altered in a certain way or does the actually user program it to say a channel means this
right so it's got like a limited memory and programme it so it's sort of iffy but that's kind of what you'd say
i always feel like first i wanna know what it looks like before 'cause if it's something really really small then it's sort of harder to imagine a base for it that was p quite a s substantial size sort of standing up
right
well the other thing is like even if it's got a few buttons so we want it to be bigger than this 'cause it still fits in your hand so you still wanted something that's comfortable and substantial but not necessarily full of buttons
are you gonna lose it easier
yeah
so i that's the other thing it's like
you know
are we gonna have certain chips that are gonna require bigger size period
but like you know if we get more complicated then it's gonna v be have to be bigger to just accommodate the chip size
so we sh
yeah
i'm a away from
the base yeah
smaller and smaller yeah yeah yeah
you're kidding

oh watches i've but i've never washed a cell phone
well titanium s i was saying that titanium if we're being restricted then
i would probably lean away from that
yeah
that'll yeah exactly
the selling point yeah
are we restricted by this
twenty five euros


so you're talking about like when it leaves our salesroom then it's all gonna be cherry coloured or is it gonna be the kinda thing where people come back and swap it
okay
the what the top face right
yeah
a tracker yeah
well my little sister got for christmas she got one of those key finders that's like a key ring and
you have to whistle in a certain frequency for it to work and then she would laugh and it would start going off
in her purse and you couldn't turn it off so it became highly irritating
but then it
hmm okay
well that depends on what the energy is needed
as long as we sell it with it
right that's what i meant
what's it gonna yeah what's it gonna look like
um
well my issue with that is if it got too big though 'cause if you have the circle and the button in the middle then is it gonna get wider than your your hands are because w and then would the buttons be too small if it was enough to fit on it
yeah
but is that for which
do we have both sides
well the other option is in instead of a scroll you just have the buttons up on the side which are on the side
um what colour
well i sort of like having the a yellow strip at the bottom with the r r  like that
and that's at the bottom of it
which button
yeah
yeah

i'm just really wary of the putting anything on a button
what's the button well w w then what's the button do and how do you know that that is what the button does
i guess just looking at examples y you just don't ever see the logo on a button it's always on the actual casing

but you don't but uh yeah you don't see it
well hang on
the other option is i don't know if you can see it but it's like if
yeah it's like the second to last slide
interface yeah
yeah um

okay it's the very right one you see at the bottom it's kind of difficult to see but you have like a d sort of s division
between the bottom like where the logo is and if we have the replaceable section it's like the top it doesn't necessarily
replace the entire top and so you have that one piece that stays and the rest just sort of clips in
if c you envisioning it and so that stays the same when you have the logo and then you have this s slip that kinda clips in and that's the bit that changes
hmm
yeah yeah yeah
right that's like you know a a cellphone it's like the the screen is always just left opened
and so what we are gonna do it like bright yellow with the r r 
yellow
yeah
oh that one
um ha hang on let me catch up
did we finalise what buttons we're including or we just everything that we said before
yeah
fun

yeah
yeah
okay so trend watching
uh since we do put the fashion in electronics it is kind of important how our product looks
so i guess we can go ahead and go to the next so what they want right now customers want fancy
versus functional um basically about fifty eight percent of what they like of the product that
they want describing like the in order of how much they want fifty eight per cent of the
decision of what it should look like fancy versus functional and then it has to also be technologically
innovative and yet easy to use so the customer basically is confused they don't know exactly
what they want they want us to tell them
yes exactly so we can go to next okay so in milan and paris
recently the trends have been showing that clothing shoes and furniture are basically
just covered with fruits and vegetable patterns so i don't know if we want to go with that
um and also the spongy feel is in in contrast to last year i don't know really i mean i guess
the spongy could relate to the buttons if we want to rather than like a hard clicky button that you find
on like some mobiles and stuff you'd want like a softer touch i mean do you guys know what i mean yeah
um but as for the fruits and vegetable patterns i don't know if we really want to go with that because it is just a trend
and our product we want to stay around for much longer than just a few months because yeah
i mean that could just be a spring thing right now
okay awesome um so design preferences um we need easy
to read like large buttons clearly labelled so that i mean 'cause we talked about that
being a problem um and then also buttons illuminating upon touch you said that in your design with the bulb
um and that could also tie in with the colour scheme uh we need the real reaction
logo and colour scheme obviously that's one of our key goals we wanna promote our product
and i was thinking about different types of designs and i came up with something actually right here
so what we could do is something like an old fashioned telephone like this where we put
the buttons around like we'd put a big on off button or something else in the middle i mean it could be the arrows or whatever for channel up
and down and then put the numbers around in like an old fashioned dial shape 'cause then it'll appeal to older generation and like said
retro's cool so it's classically retro so i mean that's just an idea
if you guys like it and yep and that's it
that's cute
yeah

i have four of those remotes

okay
that would be amazing though yeah no splinters would
what is that
mm
right
okay
oh this the thing we were talking about earlier
yeah like using the menu to be like enter your name into the screen like on the menu options so that way the remote reads it
i feel like voice recognition would be
i don't know w it would be too hard to really i mean we could do it but
technology
and it is a growing trend the higher technological like
the i mean just like the more advanced it is
the better it'll sell
yeah 'cause we need to know how big it's gonna be and how heavy
oh the base yeah
w
we need to decide well so we can figure how big it's gonna be like exactly what buttons we want and exactly
it could be like this yes i'd well uh
this one is really comfortable like i like the sides whatever because
but if we have the um the locator then we don't have to worry about that
so we can make it small if we have a l locating device
hmm
two double a s
for this size
right
yeah
smaller without yeah
i think if we had a a locating device with the small one i think that seems way more advanced
yeah
yeah because i mean if even looking at cellphones right now those trends the smaller the hotter it is yeah
oh
yeah
ouch
a phone whoa that would wow that would hurt
yeah wood
yeah 'cause if it's gonna cost us more to produce a chip titanium will be more expensive
yeah
we could do that because all our research shows that people are definitely willing to spend more if
good plan
oh
yeah who knows
o or we could like take off this
yeah
yeah
yeah because the soft latex definitely is squishy that's in well i mean squishier than like yeah just a hard plastic
'cause that uh what it type of yeah for voice activation would it be like a certain term what we would say like
because people could just be talking and we don't want it going off all the time
so uh
ooh uh see i'm uh i'm strangely attracted to it because i know that's it's definitely gonna be big because it's i don't know it's just so high tech
oh then maybe voice
maybe voice activation won't be good
yeah n n no we just want it to be a finder
but do can your can the department make
oh brilliant then
yeah good point
i think triple a  it'll be lighter
i mean more more come in a package yeah
that's a good point
we could think about it and come back to it next meeting we still have one more meeting
yeah it could be whatever as long as there's something big in the middle because like the old phones there's like that just like piece of metal or like a picture or something in the middle
oh that's true
good point
so scroll buttons on the side and then buttons on top
but we definitely if we have scroll things on the side we definitely have to have 'em labelled
yeah like on the side of it oh if it's just up and down
well you could do some on both sides
yeah that's squishy that's squishy
have buttons
yeah that
yeah
yeah or like a gun metal grey 'cause then it combines the silver and the black
yeah buttons wear off
hmm
but we want it to be seen we need it to be seen
right
yeah
some of tho
well some of those buttons though are blue based um well a lot of those buttons are blue based well kind of um
and then if v we do have them illuminate upon contact they could illuminate yellow like
if we like the one all the way on the left uh you ca you can see it on your computer better um where
the button is actually blue but the number itself is clear or white or whatever so if you pressed it
would illuminate yellow so we'd have blue and yellow for the touch buttons
yeah
mm yeah
ah yeah

mm hmm
so uh which version of my data was that the very first one yeah okay
yeah v i mean really doesn't matter just wanted to know if i'm just


yeah
yeah probably probably all these uh huhs and uh hmms are spelled differently in the thing or what's the problem you should generalise
ah ha that's a very old one rather i think those s s and e s and so on the single letters are because
of the problem with my um first version of the text thing
'cause i think the
hmm
yeah but but perhaps more than half otherwise you go in too slowly yeah
um uh sorry the only problem with the first meeting is for ex that there's no um a hot spot annotation for that but i mean that's not not a real problem m
i uh think it might why because um i um steve lay quite a lot of um weight on um you know uh surfing through meetings
so we should at least provide an overview of different meetings of one group at the beginning he um talked quite a lot about that
um and what about the similarity measure for segments do we um also
present that in this window and do we do it across meetings
uh i think that was planned at the beginning wasn't it
yeah
uh okay so it wouldn't be displayed in in the uh graphical display oh
um no i i'm just coming back to our initial idea of presenting some you know all the similar segments in uh across meetings and separating by uh some things like
mm hmm
oh i i have that file so just





did you overtake that code from the original thing
yeah but also speeding up the audios and s
um where we have a moving band the graphical display that also moves according to the
yeah
uh f i'm pretty sure that i can uh always find something to improve there so i mean if you need me
to work on something else um i can try to finish my stuff
um early but um otherwise i can
still keep working on it improving it i think
yeah
yeah
yeah ten percent


so so you want um the dialogue act numbers to be um continuous throughout the corpus so that second meetings begins with three hundred um something
couldn't we couldn't we just um take the um a name
each um each dialogue act um meeting dot um
dialogue act number it would be a la longer name but
a problem um yeah
for example as there are not um f  zero values for every speaker or on sometimes not for every meeting um how will i count that up i mean
ah okay at the moment i don't even generate any document uh document for those
but because i mean it's not zero it's just a noun hmm
but wouldn't it be better for the importance measure if that just wouldn't be part of it then the
hmm
yeah
yeah but do we really want do display them separately because the user won't okay for now for our s okay
yeah but then the user would have to know about what s w was what and what contributed to the blue stripes and what contributed to the red ones uh i think that wouldn't be a good idea
mm hmm
okay couldn't we couldn't we write one programme that calculates all the um
f for all our different contributions to the importance measure the um a absolute
um dialogue act numbers for the meeting
because at the moment we all produce the numbers for each meeting separately
yeah but we should all use the same programme i think would prevent us from having too much mistakes in it or at least uh the mistakes would be consistent
no it's not really difficult it's just
yeah i mean i can do it i can read in the different um importance measures and then re re calculate the numbers
mm


okay
okay
okay
yeah no i'm just like sort of like preparing people for um it looks like it looks like really nothing it looks
like basically less than n th their stuff but actually dave has written a whole underlying different structure now and
if we hooked it up with my display then we should fairly easily from now get to a stage where we can like select individual
segments and click on them then play that part in a compressed way and display density information now at
the moment the application is
yes sure but so at the moment we have a dialogue act window and a graphical display
w i'm not sure no the interesting thing is the sound came when i tried it last time after
i i triggered off something by clicking on something yeah there suddenly
they come probably they're just slow at loading and they don't have the buttons yet so at the moment the display
is still dis coupled from it it's loading your data i'm not quite sure is this it probably looks like vera's data
from from the looks of it
yeah the segments are made up at the moment but the code's there for integrating real segments and this is summarised
based on just vera's data at the moment from some part of the meeting so we're we're not loading the whole
thing at the moment yet properly but the important thing is this is summarised based on i i realise i'm always pointing at
my screen and you don't see so this stuff is summarised based on on these intensity measures
and we don't have the exact audio record for this usually say we should have just copied it so just to show dave has put a
uh music file in there and the music file is playing without gaps that's because
the way how we handle it at the moment is that dave prepares an audio file creates an audio file dynamically from
just the chunks that we wanna have and that runs in synch with what we have in the
i'm not even sure why i'm making loud it's just
so we see that running along with playing
of the music we see the the highlight of the dialogue acts
okay s
so and and that already this part here already is dynamically created um shall i just load it with jasmine's data just to see a different where's the
quite old yeah we were b like doing this we were just concerned with the whole
stuff and dave where what am i looking for am i looking for in data manager where am i looking
or is it f is it where the is it where the file names are is it here is it uh sh is it here where
um words importance file
in my display
uh let me t
i d
just

okay so wh where did you say in prog
w you know where that is just about
above that
like in
in this main in this routine
there is something read importance with a zero and there is read word importance with a one
shall i swap those around hmm
well wha wha what what's the differe so th this is reall
yeah
shall i just swap the file numbers around from now
or would that crash anything
oh yeah and and we really leave a maybe have to find out where
mm
mm so you have time this afternoon yeah so here
so this shows if we see anything at all then we see at the moment at least that we are definitely
be um having a different summary just because we're having a different im um important measure
so you see that um i it does something like at the moment i think this was yeah
yeah that's an old old old version so it shows um and so if you if you think about
how the old version happened then you see it makes sense that words like prosody just like a sing if that was the only utterance
then that probably scored quite well and stuff
um
we have to get these buttons dave
yeah
unfortunately i didn't get the the bar on the display working just yet but that should be a small issue
yeah i know this is very old we just never bothered to update the stuff because we were working on so we see that we have a very different density curve as well for this one
and
yeah so from here we go and it hopefully won't be too difficult to now first of all put the right segments in put a sliding bar into this so
that people see where they are so i'm uh i'm i'm constantly touching stuff on my screen i realise and
and then make selections based on a segment now what we're not quite sure is what's the best way for
like how the summariser works should it always compress a segment to a constant length though by a constant factor
of time or
what would you think sort of if you know if if there's a certain degree of of summarisation what should be the constant
so always like a so it should always whatever reduce it to half the original
'cause an al like an alternative view would be that
yeah yeah well i guess that could be uh adaptable 'cause an an alternative view would be that you could sort of make
it that it always is the same length so if you like if the whole meeting is selected it compresses the whole meeting to five minutes then if
one um segment uh w one topic is selected then it plays this whole topic
in five minutes but that's sort of that gives people a bit less control over so maybe
we should do it instead that it yeah it c it you can spec
yeah what's that you discussed for today though what's there to talk about for today
shall we abandon the whole notion of seeing the whole m one whole group as one single thing and just work on a p certainly from now on probably for good that means i mean
no
do we have everything for the same meeting at the moment like is it are you y are you all working on the same meeting
okay
did anyone ever check if that's actually a good meeting like or f comparably to others
'kay
yeah 'kay
yeah
no
yeah especially because i mean that's that's that's only done like once every time the selection changes right
so even if you sort of even if you do an hourglass at that moment and you know even if it pauses for ten seconds
well that's tough luck then uh think we should just make sure that if it takes quite
some time that that the clock doesn't start before or that the audio and the clock are in synch sort of so th
yeah yeah there's a wait for command for an external ca like for an external call to make sure that the external thing is finished because in general like that's sort of running parallel i think yeah
i have some code for system calls like that handles the in and the output if you need some of that
okay
okay cool um i don't really know what to talk about
we have
see there's there's one week after my dissertation so we're f uh before the presentation of the prototype which i can work a lot lot lot on this so that's good um
yeah well the graphic display will definitely have more information um if we're at the moment abandoning abandoning
the concept of displaying the whole series of meetings just because it's for us
like more bureaucracy more complexity and it probably just won't give us any brownie points in the presentation or do you think it will
i mean do you thi like
i c
we're
as one meeting yeah yeah and then maybe have some basic information like if
yeah so just a little bit of ad additional information in the display that knows where meetings picking it over and otherwise internally we treat it like so we have continuous i d s for the segments yeah that works
yes but apart from that we don't really do anything different as if it was just one meeting yeah i completely agree so the only thing it would be that the display gets information about where they are and displays them as hard boundaries

um
yeah so the initially i thought it was sort of more a search functionality um that simply there's one button that says find similar segments and then in the same display where we display the search results from the search
wha
well i'm not so you think displaying uh like an information about similarity to the select uh like to a selected meeting in to a selected segment in the other segments
no no i think that's i really don't wanna do that to be honest um it would be nice but like just
yeah but i it it should appear as a continuous thing f for the yeah
but i'm not i'm not sure if it's worth much bother though like if we do a s like a similarity search and just like you say
find me similar segments and then sort of like you have a list and you click on one of them and then you go to that segment i think that's quite useful
um even without displaying them sort of dis continuously
well i was thinking of just like really just a m more or less just imagine those are search results each like
each of them sort of them sort of giving whatever we should aim to get some names for segments like just some
extraction of something that we can call and if it's just the single highest um importance measure o phrase
of a segment so that we have something to display for them like basically just a summarisation down to one segment
and it would just be a list like this and you click on one and then w you tho you know then the whole bureaucracy kicks in like
this gets the nota notification this gets the notification
and then we could like we could sort of use the same thing for um yours and mine because yours would sort of give just the segment i d s and mine would give the start segment i d s
so basically this display would have information about a segment where something starts maybe
se well maybe also something where something ends like for mine and some string that we pass
to describe what like what it is you wait your search what would it return would it return just
the specific like it would go right to the utterance right
yeah sure sure sure um yeah so in in your case like it would basically would
probably say the utterance here or at least some part of the u yeah and in my case it
would say some name for the segment and then you would just click on it and then like the whole thing would kick in
like you c you click on it and and the selection moves and the display goes to that part
yeah
do we have them with a speaker at the moment
okay cool
just random sp
so what about
so what about a general layout like this that we have here the dialogue acts and there the player b and here we'd have a search button and the similarity thing button
i mean we can
ah good question um
yeah yeah i think we probably like we can leave those like i  frames and just arrange them sort of yeah
alternatively we'll have like the whole thing running already when we do the presentation and we just arrange it manually my c
uh apparently microsoft sometimes or like at least in the past the demonstrations where they just exactly knew which
five percent of the system were working and that's what we're gonna do as well has anyone ever seen anything
from the other group they have all ah they have all sorts
of sc scarily good

if anything we build in a time bomb that only fails if the date is the date of the presentation
yes because we are nice people
dave this rate thing do we have any direct control to that or is that just directly controlling how fast it plays and sort of we can only
that's a pity because it looks like it's doing something
'kay
um do you think if we override their component and just override whatever the the action to that slide bar is

so if so something like their skipping would it actually corporate with our system at the moment would ours skip automatically forward
yeah i realise
uh
yeah whatever
i think this simple this simple st view that we get that you can just like pass things into and then check when they got clicked really
well couldn't the summar oh no then we would have to override though
hmm but i in a sense i mean if we see uh yeah but like probably that would be the same thing that we also
display up here because i really think that having like some but that would probably even be shorter than five lines like really just getting
i think getting one or two best utterances for each segment would be really worthwhile
for the search results i probably think that instead of a p a simple summary something that displays the utterance
where the where the word was like displays in a highlighted form where it was found

to to apply what
well alternatively we could always have sort of a third small component whatever like if this was the search results and then they are just like something else that's part unwritten when miles goes over this one it triggers that one to display it or something
and a tool tip is i think a very straightf yeah it especially with a preview we'll be able to get tool tip fairly simple
because it's just a property of it uh i've never seen tool tips displaying several lines
and stuff though so i wonder how good that'll look but we'll we can try that
really well so far only seen tool tips of few words length but yeah uh that should be fairly easy
yeah yeah we will have that's actually just gonna happen today and we will have proper segments as well
um the thing i remember like i have to find out how to do it without redrawing the display each time because the display
at the moment does take you see like it takes a fraction of a segment to display but probably too
much to update it to completely repaint the whole thing every second so um at the
moment i'm just whenever it needs to be repainted i'm not thinking about to do and just repainting the thing as a whole with
a moving bar that's not a good idea but until i think of something better what i'll just do is i'll just i'll probably not have a moving bar the
whole length but just some indicator somewhere like whatever just uh a triangle moving at the bottom for now or something and
then i can just like repaint a small area or something
yeah
yeah i have to find i have to find out the the commands for like really just redrawing a small
small piece so i have to just there's examples t um for for doing stuff like that i just have to read up on it but yeah displaying the
the current position bar will be easy provided that my whole calculations of like where we are in time
here are all correct i mean that's just something that isn't tested so far but it should be i mean
so the the general concept will will you two just uh keep on working
on improving the information density measures or do you think there'll be a point when you say well that's that's it we have
we have an information density score and and we'll be looking for something else to do or
okay
'kay well i'm actually at the moment i don't see how many people can work on on the programming anyway
hmm
no
did we
mm hmm mm hmm mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah yeah well i guess i mean
uh i was a bit pissed off yesterday about that part because it was sort of just like a decision we had taken
so okay we've been talking about evaluation l in the first report and there's nothing new we can say about it this time and i thought
we said that in the meeting before we wrote the report and then he came back with this whole criticism saying like oh you didn't say anything about um evaluation
and then yeah but we did that in the last report we said we're not gonna go oh but now i expected it in more detail and oh
if that translates to eighty percent like if if those actually translate to to really like their percentage scores then that would be good
hmm
sixteen
what there were forty percent each and this is how they became
sixty percent now what okay um how much do you think there were
ten each not bad we also it it just means that he's relatively lenient because i mean
the reports were i think they were ok good reports but like probably somebody
else wouldn't have said they were excellent so that's a good sign 'cause it shows that he's not hell bent on
uh and then he'll see the final display and he'll realise that it was all fake that we didn't actually do any of the work
see the thing is
like for me personally i think a lot of work will be done in in the last minute in this specific case that's not a new statement at general but
like the week just before the presentation i have most of the stuff that i i'm doing now i'm rid of it including the dissertation and dil
so
hmm
so jasmine if if you got something like this and like this for for your current data would that help in
i sort of have been promising this for a week now i realise i'm gonna give you
uh 'cause it's empty at the moment i mean dave i it's a pretty much r it sh should be a question of copying it over it r over right so i just didn't
yeah
can probably add a open file dialogue box with minimum effort because i think it's a ready made component that returns a string for a file name
or that w yeah so we can do that today
yeah
yeah but why don't we
yeah i know sure it j like it it would not necessary need to be a part of the final thing but why don't we just provide some means even if it does it automatically in the beginning as a start up option just to ask for a file name 'cause then we can just publish a script that you just run and then this whole thing starts
you know what happened to me today like i forgot about the whe i'm not sure if we had that problem before finding the java media
the java x  media stuff on all the jars for that yeah i was like suddenly panicking
at eleven when i realised god i just thought it would be very straight forward to get it going here and then i got that thing
yes so um if we do a version which automatically opens up a file open box
you're yeah f so you're automatically producing the right format with this no um with
just per utterance
okay
mm hmm so would it be easy slash dissu difficult slash impossible like at the moment if we skip to a s treating a whole series as one thing so like creating one file for the whole series that gives the uttera the ideas from top to bottom and
but the entire corpus it
hmm
yeah where do you think you can uh produce something like that like i think we should go for like for one group not for the whole corpus
no no n
yeah
yeah
yeah no but dave um yeah so tha that's what i was thinking that like the second meeting should continue till the first one's stopped a and for one group that's true because it's sort of like their meeting's you know like that one meeting and then
hmm
the utterances okay and and that's the
but it just doesn't make sense in the logic wise sort of like until here it's the meeting about this thing and then it's that thing and then it's it's this like whereas
whereas uh s mayb maybe we're talking k like so so your data manager would that then handle the whole thing would that handle it that this would only like the display would only display one group
yeah so if i mean i don't mind where it's done so if the data manager filters it out and like i
just think that in in the logic of the programme it's it's much easier to justify why we say we treat a series of meetings as
one single thing rather than w
but a
i b like would just i would find logical reasons for why you can sugg say peop
uh but i see this two completely g def like i see each ser each group is completely separate amount of data that shouldn't
okay but would it still like would we still in the logic of it still have continuous i d s
if we say we take just just one meeting like would would the display for example still be able to just say i want from
whatever from the first until the last and and everything in between sort of and and the data manager would then
display that just for that meeting okay well if that's possible yeah
okay

yeah that's what vera said no so you you'd you'd also say that it shouldn't be part of the importance measure if there's no f  zero
yeah well i i don't know how we're gonna do the fusing of the different if inf importance measures anyway bu if that's done in the programme or if that's done off line
yeah yeah
yeah does anyone have a good idea like at the moment to play around with it what's a good way of displaying
two types of information in the in the colour display i mean uh there's probably logical ways like if one is whatever if one is the darkness and the other
is the redness or something has anyone ever experimented with sort of displaying two dimensional information in in colour because then
we could do jasmine's and and vera's probably in the same scale
yeah
f for now no for now like yeah for us
hmm s
yeah yeah i think we sh we shouldn't
t
we should assume a n assume a non linguistic user
but i think probably for us like in developing it it would be interesting yeah so um i'll try the red green blue wha what's does anyone know what this hue and saturation thing like what that no nobody's done much colour work
oh actually it's not a problem of doing it like i think it's
okay okay well i guess i'll just take a look at the photoshop colour cube or whatever it is gimp colour cube and look at
yeah yeah
'kay so we'll produce a version of this which opens up with a dialogue box um where you can
select a file is that right dave would we be able to do that and and then you'll get this
type of display with that file
and that's uh at the moment are w so are we are we still talking about using that one meeting that everyone is using now are talk about swat swi swapping now switching
yeah so everyone should produce stuff for the whole corpus now or
okay
okay
we need the explicit information about each meeting then like sorta whi from which utterance which utterance it goes and stuff
is anyone is anyone providing that at the moment i didn't does any
okay okay
well if you
yeah i'm not sure about
that
as in i just don't understand much about how difficult it is to do to do different things
well as l as long as yeah
as long as everything's in the right order it shouldn't like we should even be able to just i d  it when we're reading it in
hmm
'kay
yeah so if we email out a script on how to like f load it
um so yours would always like yours would always be loaded in i guess like you y there would only be one version of your data and you can just override that version if you want but you wouldn't have a file open dialogue box for that then
well what would the option be
okay but like so make it an option which one it displays or which one it uses for the summarisation or 'cause it 'cause i was just thinking sort of so that both jasmine and vera could um see their data working and
mm is that not getting too much
so we would have like each of those components for
for jasmine and vera yeah i know
yeah yeah
mm hmm
but would that not require three clocks and i but that but but that also means
okay 'cause the dialogue uh the display also gets the information about like the relative and the absolute times so that would be convenient if that just if there's just one of that 'cause otherwise it's getting messy
so why don't we just make a swap ins why don't we make a switch instead like
i don't wanna do like three like three internal time scales so that's just getting messy
well i guess really i mean like alternatively why don't we go for the simplest thing and just create three scripts or two scripts which load a parameter uh f common line parameter which is which file to load and and then it's just there
okay
yep
okay would the others
oh you oh you just have three summarisers and then they're all synched up with one clock
okay the other one is just a static dialogue acts box
okay okay yep so we have three colour displays like three or
no no sure or maybe just start with just two like without even combining them in any sophisticated way just just two yep
'kay shall we wrap that up sor sorry i'm imposing
you mean discontinuous
if i have to do it f like flexibly then i probably then it will not be significantly more difficult but is it worth any effort though i mean
'cause we'll never have more than two and we'll never ha well we'll either have one or two so in the end 'cause you don't have different versions
of well i guess you probably would have but then also
we'd have to find more sophisticated ways of loading it specifying the parameters so that might
yeah but that we wouldn't so we'd have to have some dialogue box for opening stuff it might be it might take half an hour in the display and not more than that
hmm
but it might actu i think it might not really be worth it to be honest
let's work on the other stuff first like the other stuff and just provide like something where each of them just if if there's
uh a jasmine script and a vera script and they each can load their stuff and see their data in
in the thing they ca they each can see it summarised by their data and the other one is the static
one that should be fairly easy to do right if i just double the display and you make a uh like a
non synched up second dialogue acts
and yeah and then they can tune fine tune their measures
i think it would be cool if we could check the nite clock f code or whatever code it is for this component and see if we can access those rate things and and do something useful with them and get notified when they change and stuff
yeah i think
yeah i think that's what we should do so the the thing is it's probably an easy task to read that rate but it's probably
more difficult to get an event automatically when it's changed so that's why we might have to extend nite clock and like override the function that
react to that or like the rate is probably a property which in the worst case we'd have to set public but
if we wanna react to it being changed automatically we might have to
okay so they haven't sp okay yeah
so it shouldn't like even if to even if uh if we have to extend nite clock i mean it should just be a matter of changing one
single method in it
yeah
yeah
yeah
hmm
yep yeah yep and we could justify all sorts of stuff like that
by r in the presentation by saying we deliberately tried to keep any complexity and numbers and stuff away from people
i think that's sort of a line we should go by in general sort of saying yeah we could've done oh so many th
we don't wanna confuse people we give people something simple and colourful where something is moving and where they don't have to l
deal with any numbers or text or anything like that for that matter in fact that's why we've given you a picture of a dog
sitting in a field instead of a meeting browser it is nice and it calms people down
hmm
yeah
yeah
shall we meet in an hour or so dave i'm probably gonna eat something quick
ah okay i was actually i was planning the same but we won't get so much done before three that's the thing
'kay listen so why don't we meet after three then because then i can like until three make sure that i have all the display c
yeah sure yeah s oh so we could meet at five and i have the display code ready by then which does the stuff like like having a bar where the position is and stuff and
yeah
yeah that's true
yeah yeah so we can meet in five in apple at five in appleton tower and just work on so i'll i'll have my displ i'll make sure that my display does all the stuff we've been talking about un until then
and then we'll put those things together
yeah but i mean like we we should discuss together which w like how the the search interacts with the rest
so that's not something that colin should just do in his own



how y how do you do the summary is it
so are you basing it on certain thresholds uh over a special d uh s okay
oh that's the old old one okay okay

um

so you want to send steve the prototype and we should change data where's the best best place to put it
oh
do you um take it from from my directory or do i have to put in in the sh
yeah but would you take it from from my directory or okay



maybe that's the problem maybe they have got um the minus in the code as well and then something in is messed up
uh huh
and the area could be smaller
yeah as soon as i've finished all the meetings i think there's not that much to do unless i get some evaluation method but that could be quite difficult i would have to tag uh some part of it or something
because if i d if i can't evaluate i can't do any better
because i don't know how to do better if i don't evaluate anything
yeah yeah he's really keen on that isn't he
mm
i don't know ten percent each yeah
yeah yeah
no but it's
um
yeah don't know if it's that n yeah it might be of help yeah
it's not essential though i think
hmm
uh yeah f per utteran uh i print the utterances in the i d  uh no the the i d  of the utterance and uh the measure i think
that shouldn't make too much difference if i just take well m a file or where one meeting is in or
concatenate all those shouldn't be too bad
have you currently got continuous i d s for your topic segments
oh okay i thought you had done all of them and
yeah yeah
mm hmm
okay
is that what v what you've got because um because the different meeting series overlap
i think
i don't know
might be interesting to the user though just the word importance maybe


but we have got the index um for converting from vera's i d s
to to yours so it shouldn't be a problem should it yeah i've done that for the correlation
as well so that's what that was quite easy to do
have you got that for no it's just for one meeting at the moment
oh okay sure
so what kind of change will you impose on the summarisation because if we fine tune uh um according to that and it's not finished it's n doesn't make any sense
okay
right
uh huh
okay
so you at the moment you have got a threshold and everything that's above it is displayed or how do you d
yeah so it's some kind of threshold that is set okay
okay
did i tell you that we've got kind of two way interaction if you control click an utterance it will play where it should be in the file


we should probably set those sizes 'cause that's such an easy thing to do
are you missing the sound
oh there it is
yeah
that's vera's data on the display but the segments are just made up aren't they

you can also control click on the dialogue acts and it will play that section of the file as well
yeah if you want oh that one looks almost com just you need to
the original the very first one
yeah
um it will be in program
where do i call your display
no it is on your display um where it calls which one to get you just need to change the flag
um i think it must be unless i it
oh no actually yeah you can change it for in the summary when the summary gets called in program manager you can do it
no not yet it's just picks the top ranked ones at the moment
yeah the easiest thing is in programme manager where it makes the summary it's probably the best place to do it
it'll be above that
it'll be down it's gonna be after the data manager's made yeah that
a new summary
yeah th can't remember where i put it maybe it will be in s the summary constructor then
yeah try the summaries constructor
well it reads them into separate arrays and then you can just change a flag to select one i which one it gives back
yeah if you want
uh that should be fine
yeah i should make a new constructor that lets you set the flag
yeah
yeah

yeah
it's weird on mine it complains about
okay
i think that to be honest is something we can worry about at the end i mean that's quite trivial to change and we got a lot of other work to do
yeah we need to get on that pretty shortly i think
okay so i'll need to do some changes to program manager to be able to handle um changing results
what kind of index
take and make them in a hash map or something
certainly for now yeah
yeah
um well from the point of us developing it it doesn't really make much difference
um well at the moment it's just a an old file
it'd probably be yeah best to make a copy of it
i'd have thought
i don't think i'm gonna be able to do um the speech tools through java native interface
'cause the documentation for them is horrific it's really bad so i think i'm thinking i'll just write
out a script and do it with a system call
not yet yeah the i just don't think it's worth wasting too much time on it
yeah
hmm
i don't think it would take that long anyway
yeah yeah so yeah it we just start everything after the summary's been created it's not a big problem
yeah
um i don't think i'll need that really 'cause i'll just dump out a temporary file
i think we should decide what we want it to actually look like in the end
'cause are we gonna have some kind of tree view to represent the meetings and stuff
because if if we're not then we'd probably have to make the graphical display display a bit more information
mm
it's not too difficult to do and it's sort of a hack kind of way 'cause we can just treat it all as one meeting
but we'll just create like hard segments at the start and end of each meeting like ones that are red instead of black or something like that
mm hmm so other than yeah other than well we'll just create a hard boundary in between each one so you can see the thing
yeah i mean that's quite a cheap way to do it
it might be possible to do it in the summariser
yeah it will still appear continuous on the display
so how are we gonna display the search for this corpus
okay
okay how advanced are we gonna have our search because i definitely think we should restrict it to i think we should um be able to restrict it to specific speakers and things like that but nothing too fancy
oh i uh well with a speaker i d 
yeah in fact if someone could create a file with the speaker i d s and speaker names that done okay
where is it is it in the group directory
okay
yeah it's um the data manager should be quite well documented so you should be able to use that for the search quite easily
uh from yeah on the dialogue act level i've not got it reading in the topic segments yet
just 'cause that was lower priority but yeah all the you can get all the utterances
so where are gonna put the search results
if we move everything to the right a little bit and make a little bar on the left yeah like the search results in there
yeah yeah like we'll basi yeah we'll get something to print out their locations so we'll arrange it in a nice little order we
yeah it's quite easy to do though so i think we probably should
uh we should try running that thing again see what it does now or just delete or back up it

oh j so i can print obscene messages in the background to um standard output

it doesn't seem to work very well it's capable of slowing down the audio but speeding up doesn't seem to work at all
you have to pause it and play it for the yeah that's uh their clock component
oh it's all part of the same component that does that
uh no we'd have to look in their code and see what it actually does
this thing is really bizarre it slows it down a bit the speed up doesn't seem to work
yeah also their grasp of algebra is terrible well yeah it shouldn't be minus two times it should be half
'cause that'd be playing it backwards twice as quickly
uh it should do but you've probably gone past the end of the file

i don't know i think it's just um it did do it it's that bright selection
be yeah uh
either that or another
something that might be quite cool is if you could um you know like some applications when you open a file
you get like a little preview if we could do something like that that displays like a five line summary
when you you're about to open the file or something like that
hmm yeah
the summariser is quite quick it could probably do it dynamically
yeah it'd look pretty and i'm not convinced you'd get any kind of good quality summary out of it in only five lines but
another quite good thing might be um how are you do you know how easy it is to apply two tips to things in java i've never done it before
'cause what would be quite cool is if on this search result you could give it each one a tool tip that had the context like the utterance before the utterance itself and the utterance after so that when you hovered over it
but yeah if we can get the tool tip we should use it though 'cause i think it should be quite easy
yeah that's what i would have thought
um it's quite common in like some applications yeah
um all you need to do is just one value um the height it
doesn't change in value does it so if you just remember the colour that it was last at and you re draw
a line behind it of that colour and then the next one
no right now it probably won't be that much benefit right now it probably won't be much benefit
so this is the component based evaluation he was talking about yesterday isn't it yeah
oh so that's a bit annoying 'cause like it's my hope we could just go cobble something together and just say look it's great
yeah
yeah
i think they do 'cause that's the first um sixty percent or isn't it 'cause it's i thought they were thirty percent each
only ten percent
i thought they're thirty
yeah
'cause i think we'd rampantly underestimated how long it'd take to do the actual uh software engineering bit
see i'll probably just be starting stuff then 'cause i'll be starting the uh s n l p  thing and the d m  project
what are you doing for your d m  project
oh
is yeah i kind of nicked the idea he went about code m l  i'm gonna make one for guitar tablature yeah but i i think it might have been bit off more than i could chew so i think it's gonna be quite hard
mm well tab doesn't usually have music notations just um pitch information uh
see how far i get anyway
mm yeah well you can easy add a command line parameter
mm
it may even return a file directly possible
probably um the thing is it i don't know it doesn't really make sense to call it file open or anything like that 'cause that's it's more like an option
to set the par
because it reads everything just from one file
mm hmm
oh yeah that did happen once before
or even just the entire corpus that's what um colin's file has got
does his it's it's easy to load that much just text
uh i think it makes more sense to go for the whole corpus because the meet the um the i d s gonna have gaps and stuff in them otherwise and it means you have to read through the list of utterances when you're compiling all the data over and over and over and over again
yeah
yeah
well a at the moment the main data i that's just uh uniquely numbered throughout the entire corpus
well at the moment from the dump file it's just got them uniquely numbered throughout the entire corpus
hmm
and it makes more sense to do that anyway because um that means you got more flexibility with how you want to group them and one thing you really don't want is ever to have two utterances that could potentially have the same i d 
yeah but that's the point of the data manager is to manage all that
it's possible but it's it's not really much point 'cause at the moment it's got quite nice property that the dialogue act number also coincides with the array index number in the array of dialogue acts which is quite nice
well you could you could choose whatever you wanted
but you may not be interested in the same series each time you might want to display all meetings that had a particular
phrase mention say and those might not be the ones that we enumerated as one meeting in which case you're gonna have conflicting
i d s and things like that whereas the da if you do it in the data manager you can control any
logic like that programmatically rather than doing it by hand and setting it in stone for all time
well it's just good practice like it separates the data from the programme logic what you're talking about doing is embedding some of the programme logic in the data
yeah but that's a decision we're forcing on the user when we don't have to
yeah i don't see why not
yeah
i think it sh everything should be like that continuous in chronological order
i'm not sure i haven't really looked at the data
if there's no value i guess you have to put a zero in
yeah
well it might be more sensible to assign it an average value
well we'd w only use f  zero when it was present though wouldn't we
we well we'd want to use f  zero when it's present
yeah
yeah in the summariser it'd be the uh ideal place to do that
you could use um red green and blue to display up to three
well i don't know how to do it in java but
the trouble is that hue isn't a very sensible scale like it comes up to like red two or three times and stuff like that
or you could just split it into two blocks i suppose for now
yeah
well there's no reason why it can't swap meetings at the moment if the data's there for it
yeah that's most sensible way to do it i think
yeah that's well it's not reading that in yet but that will be part of the data manager as well like there's access classes all defined for that
yeah it's in your file isn't it
'cause each utterance has got an i d  associated with it
i don't know
so just keep yeah just enumerate up for the next number three
well that's what i meant is it's a bit pointless having it as file open 'cause it will be opening those files
all the time it's more sensible to have it as an option and the location of them or just so you can configure
the the location of all the files as an option but when it starts up it should just read them from
the default place
yeah that makes sense
oh of course t there's no reason why we can't make a development version that displays both has two win utterance windows and uh two graphical displays i mean obviously you it'd have to pick which one to synch the clock to
to add another dialogue act window is really easy
oh like say if you could make a um change to your thing so it could display uh
like it in two halves so like the top half one the bottom half the other or maybe three actually
maybe top half one bottom half the other and the third one an average that we can change
the parameters for
and then yeah i could easily make it throw out three different dialogue acts
no i'd just have two of them not synched up because it's just for evaluating the data
oh right yeah i see what you mean oh no no it's still good because um
oh no it isn't yeah i know what you mean
yeah
yeah i suppose
no hold on you it wouldn't need three internal time scales 'cause only one's synched to the clock or it c and the others are all
absolute real time aren't they that's what's displayed on that the bar is real time
isn't it so they would all be in the same time scale
no no only one of them synchs and two of them are just yeah
'cause it doesn't really matter they synch up for the purpose of evaluating the data
yeah i mean not in the final version just for now
yeah
how easy would it be to make it so you can add arbitrary numbers of them do you think
no like uh different measures to the display
well that's the thing if it's gonna take more than like an hour or something it's not worth it
yeah
mm
but that's easy 'cause mine can take uh any number of parameters
mine i'll need to make a minor addition to the data manager and the summariser but it's more or less ready to go with that
okay
yep
mm hmm
yeah should be easy
we could just make that rate be something completely different just disconnect it from whatever it's doing and then have that set the length of the summary or something like that
mm
well it doesn't it doesn't react to it being changed automatically it only reacts when you press play at the moment so you have to stop it and start it to make any effect
mm
yeah i mean just disconnect it from whatever it sends the media player and connect it up to our summarisers that makes different length summaries
'cause like we could make that not even have like a a real
sort of meaning just put like max and min and the user can just like set it in between
wherever they want the uh without actually telling them what it actually means if you see what i mean
yeah
we should certainly take away the labels that say minus four times as well
'cause that's incredibly unintuitive

well
but it won't make any huge changes like it'll always have the ef the ability to read the original
ones but it might be quite cool to have a combined measure like just a weighted average
is probably the most sensible way to about it and possibly thresholding it
no it just takes the top like twenty or fifty or however many
yeah
um well i was gonna go to the gym at about three so
or to be honest like it's much quicker for me to get stuff done on my own it'd make more sense for us to divide up spend a couple of hours dividing up tasks and then do them separately
well it'll be after four then 'cause i'm gonna go at three the gym
okay so meet say five till seven that should be enough time
because yeah it's much quicker if we're both working separately i think 'cause when we've been working together like i've just not got a lot done and like when i go home i'll spend like the same amount of time and get loads done if you see what i mean
yeah okay
okay
so you're gonna be up there as well then

yep
right that's pretty good

mm

mm i suppose it should depend on the length of the segment
mm i guess that would make more sense yeah
hmm
hmm
yeah i was wanting to talk about the search
yeah yeah i'm quite keen to do like most of that like make an index search and stuff
yeah i think what basically what i need at is um just a list of words with an index to start with for each meeting
um i suppose it doesn't really matter as long as they're unique and it can i can pass 'em back to you and you can use that to the display um yeah probably
yeah oh yeah do you want you know how you've just got data for one meeting are you needing more at the moment
mm i guess not
yeah i think we're all using the first one hmm

um i think it segments quite well though first one
yes it's not really important that we get it like nice and c clean or anything like that
mm
hmm
yeah yeah yeah yeah i think so
yeah
yeah
right
yeah
yeah i suppose my search will r it returned the utterance but if you're searching for a word you need an index for the word and the utterance as well
um it p it'd probably select it yeah it would make sense to do that
yeah
very very basic yeah

yeah yeah if yeah if if you can pass me like the dialogue act with
yeah was it the speaker and then
it
yeah that that should be enough shouldn't it
'cause you can
oh yeah i d i did that yeah
yeah i d i did that as well actually
um yes in the data yeah group data speaker data or something
yeah
right
yeah
is it sorry could i d use that at the moment it's ready to like get dialogue acts out with
yeah
yeah yeah
alright yeah i should maybe just get started with 'em
making a search with that
hmm
yeah
yeah
no
yeah
yeah of course we've got here
that would be evil
yeah
oh dear
oh
yeah maybe it has a different constructor when you create it
is it
oh yeah i suppose
yeah
so do you think a tree view for like an overview of the whole set of meetings would be good yeah it w it would look good
hmm
yeah i suppose you could calculate them off line and just yeah have a like like a l little thumbnail or something
yeah i mean it would be a bit pointless but it would look good for the presentation yeah i suppose
yeah
hmm
i've never done it but i'd imagine it must be quite easy
yeah it'd be nice for a presentation yeah yeah
hmm
hmm is that quite easy to do to get um a moving cursor
hmm
yeah
yeah
yeah i was just gonna do some sort of informal evaluation
yeah i did say that
yeah
yeah he did give us eight out of ten though
yeah
yeah
no i think they were ten percent each
yeah
i think they're worth ten percent
hmm
yeah i suppose he can see that we're putting the work in


i
yeah that yeah that interface and integration yeah
mm
mm hmm yeah same for me
oh yeah
oh no i forgot about that
um i'm gonna do like an on line museum archive you get like a document for each exhibit
oh yeah oh that'd be quite a good one actually
yeah would you have to do like music notation and stuff
right
okay that's n not so
hmm
hmm
well i have i've only done the first meeting but yeah th that's the plan
um for the topic segments yeah sorry for topic segments i have but for the utterances i've just got one meeting so far but the idea was that it would be continuous
yeah
remember how did i do it
hmm
i th think it should be done in the program 'cause we're probably gonna want to change it
mm yeah
yeah
hmm
yeah we should be consistent yeah
hmm yeah it should be easy to do yeah
yeah i've got the indexes for all the meetings i think yeah
no i don't think so

yeah i'll be working on the search i think it's ready to get started yeah i may as well come and you can show me how it the manager works
yeah
welcome back
uh let me see
okay roo welcome back
the waiting is for sebastian
there he is
sorry
uh no you can't sorry
well this is life sorry uh roo
okay okay people welcome back with the second meeting
um for now on the schedule are a few points
uh first of all the opening which we are doing now um second i received
um some new project requirements i'm not sure if you received them as well
um but i will tell you about it um then um the three of you uh
prepared a presentation i think sebastian
roo
ruud almost okay then we'll do your one uh uh as la uh the last um the top goal of this m
um we will figure that out ca can you try to
yeah w we will see
um it is yeah
yeah um the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product on the target group um and and the functions of the remote control so keep that in mind um
we have forty minutes so
it's now
yep okay um the new project requirements first of all um we didn't speak
about it but we should not um support teletext in the remote
um because our b um board uh feels that uh teletext is out of date
and internet is replacing teletext so um we are not even going to try to um implement
it in our product
it's a board decision um the remote control should only be used for television because it's not
uh f uh feasible it's not uh w uh uh we we cannot make it because of the time to market
um that we have to deal with uh the third requirement is that we
should focus on customers that are younger than uh forty which is important for you uh ruud
and as well for uh roo because the product should um be uh interesting
and and uh should be bought by people younger than forty um
then for roo as well uh important the corporate image should be recognisable in our product so the colour colours and the slogan um do have to be uh in the product
is that clear
any questions on these
requirements
no
okay um the individual presentations i th um roo or sebastian who of you would like to start
uh uh yeah okay great

yeah
mm hmm
yeah
uh huh
okay
uh ruud did you get that
okay so the important thing here is
in the market yeah
yeah okay w we will s we all uh
yeah okay sebastian
no it's not visible
yeah
okay
so it's fairly easy
okay
okay good
okay
okay
yeah yeah but but the question is whether um two or four buttons makes uh m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to uh include fancy lightning techniques i guess
okay
okay
yeah
okay ruud
okay well we ar we are very curio curious to what the market um will feel about such a product
so any income is welcome input
okay
yeah
okay
well that's interesting
yeah that's definitely interesting it uh it separates our product from others uh as well okay go on
okay so that's what the market tells us
yep okay
yep
well maybe maybe like clapping in your hands like um turning on and off the the the lights
reports rep respend response to it
but uh th
yeah because we do not have a a a a a home um
okay so what about the clapping technique um because you se
well you see it a lot in in light uh lightning uh uh
yeah a peak yeah
yeah
yeah that's true
well uh
yeah
yeah m maybe um w we uh we do agree on on the thing that the
remote should have such a function if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things
um maybe sebastian should have uh a detailed look later on and um come up with a solution
because that's his his field of expertise
mm hmm
yep
yeah it's a distinction in the market it's a different exactly it's an uni an unique feature and um i think um it's worth um uh looking and and probably more i interesting than uh than the lights
yeah
yeah well um according to ruud um people do not use um all the extra features very very often so
okay
okay well we we do have a wise board so i'm not questioning that
yeah okay so on the relevance scale uh the channel selection the volume selection and the teletext well we skip that
okay
no
yeah
uh uh uh i think we should go for the easier one
no
yeah
okay ruud how do you feel about that uh do you agree do you think the market would would respond to uh a simple
mm hmm
mm yeah
okay so this is is kind of uh
yeah
but but are we not in in the in the manual uh i mean if you have few buttons no display
um i mean uh i guess it's l it's working with with a shift functions and um
one button can uh
but but how does how does the remote uh report uh r uh give back to the user w in what state it is because we do not implement uh a user history
i know but but if we use uh like a stick for example um
yeah uh and we could have other buttons for the for the advanced uh functions
yeah draw draw it on the board
yeah it can break down
uh huh
okay yeah
okay but w we still we're still in the question of uh um uh putting in
advanced options um ruud just told us um the market is interested
in some advanced uh new techniques um however uh keeping it simple
is is important for the costs and all all those kind of things we need to find a balance between
uh the advanced techniques and and the user friendliness
um well for we do have to uh decide this this meeting yeah we need to um have the uh the user function uh the functions decided and um
uh our target audience
um well i do not want a full uh it's not necessary to to have a full list but i want um the kind of functions for example uh th the most important are volume and uh programme selecting
well for example that that's what we should think about l how is the remote going to look not not in the user interface but
yeah
a bit of a split mode uh l like yeah dual channel watch okay well
um m maybe i should write that down uh
ruud um what's your last name
mielsen because i i was writing it down in the last uh mielsen
right um i put all the minutes i make into the shared folder so
if you want to have a look at it you know where to find it um
yeah that's that's if you want to do it sebastian
okay um
okay so so um uh
volume programme
uh dual channel uh
and and do we want um
the ten digits
yeah
i agree actually
but we do have thirteen different dutch channels
often
well it depends on the on the on the looks on the on the
you c you can d make them very fancy by um
i mean nokia they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy so i'm i'm i do not agree
uh
exactly exactly
okay speech
yeah
to find yeah
uh
if if we would um drop the ten digits but keep the programme and the volume because maybe people do not always want to use their voice um
yeah but we do focus on younger people we d it it's a board uh decision
okay
okay
okay g good
okay
mm
yep
okay but
but but can we manage it bu uh for the costs
because it seems like a very
is a cradle very cheap
i know b uh but there should be an adapter as well
okay
okay we we have uh about ten minutes left this meeting um
i would like to hear um maybe maybe you all have th uh things not
um spoken about yeah but that are important uh ruud you
you came up with the voice recognition uh data uh are there other things about the market we should
know
okay
okay
okay so although we are focussing on younger people uh to make it uh profitable uh
profitable we we yeah we still need to take in account the the bit older people okay o okay
um roo
nothing to add
sebastian
yeah
great
mm hmm
yeah
yep
yeah and that was the main issue right the the board
yeah
the board
no it's th yeah
it's the other way around yeah
it shouldn't be a big issue
okay i'm not sure how how we'll f uh determine the costs i will have a look at it maybe you will get some information on that um i'm not sure how how that
yep
okay great um
well i think we're qui quite done um for now we will have the lunch break
um i'm don't know how long the break will be but we'll find out um
then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work uh and i'm sure your personal
coaches will uh assist you with it um i will put the minutes i just made in the project documents
folder if you want to look at it um well just do um
the interface designer um i would like to the next meeting i would like to receive the uh components
concept uh roo um from
you i would like to see
uh
i'm sorry yeah i'm sorry user interface designer uh roo i would like to see the user interface c uh concept and um
well i it should be easy that's w w what we concluded it should be an easy interface with not so much buttons s just a a p a p a volume and a programme one and um
um yeah some some fancy lights i think that's what we decided
no no no we didn't but it shouldn't be integrated yeah it's of course it's user interface but um i i was talking about really the design of the
no
we can decide the next meeting yep
yeah i guess all of you have i updated info i'm sure the marketing expert will receive uh t uh you will do some trend watching and i'm sure the market will um uh
uh will change adapt and um so we will see that um yeah that's it for now
any other questions or can we have the lunch
yeah okay good
hello
there's one of mine
hello flores
we have a slight problem i opened uh the c d  rom box uh guys
so just cancel it
yeah i opened the c d  rom box accidentally but it's alright
mm hmm
yeah

but you can't upload your presentation from here i believe
okay
i don't think it's wireless here or it is yeah okay great
yeah
time yeah
yes
yeah i'll start
um
oh how can i uh
geez and sli and show
um
just uh press it uh yes
alright
um well w we uh we had discussed this already in the fin in the previous uh discussion uh the method of the remote control is just the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set
so that was
the main uh important thing what a remote control should do then i found uh
two different kind of remote controls the multi function uh remote control with many possibilities
but um the lack of the feeling i already mentioned uh in the previous uh discussion
and the ease of use remote control with uh the less p possibilities but a great feeling in
in touching the buttons

um but um yeah
my personal preferences were ease of uh the easy to use remote control because uh the user friendliness
and uh it can be more trendy in in user design but um your new
goal f was for uh people than less than forty years old so
maybe um the multi function can be implemented in uh in our design
but it should b i think it should be a combination but teletext buttons are not uh in our
design so it should uh
take out well eight buttons or so but my in my opinion the the easy to use r c  is uh the best uh possi possibility for us
yeah
and it's also i indeed uh uh ruud's uh insight in the in the topic yeah what what does the market want i i don't know
just for uh for user desi uh user uh friendliness i uh should choose for the the ease of use remote control
scusi

energies and uh
yeah
the glow in the dark uh concept uh we discussed
succeed in it also

and what's the um if we use the leds i does it use much more energy or
okay
for the same costs it's can be uh in our
combined with the low cost circuit board so it's uh
yeah
but i think
yeah i think it's the same as in the cell phone just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons and not for
yeah but not for each button one led i think
could you step a little bit more to the right yeah thank you
yeah
sound signal
yeah
the volume and uh the zap buttons are the mostly used so
yeah well it should just have a design
the perfect design for those only those buttons and first um
yeah
yeah the sound signal just one thing i'm just wondering the sound signal from where do you execute th the s sound another device is not a solution it should be uh uh
yeah but maybe you'll uh get some new technologies for it
yeah just like uh the phones the
but but t v s don't have all uh
uh buttons uh
but i believe you will have an
i'm convinced uh sebastian will uh find uh one solution for us
but we can have just uh uh a home stat uh f a base station next to the t v  just a little
antenna or uh something well if you lost th i don't think
people would bother walking to the t v  and press that button because they lost the their remote uh that's
just uh
just a base station next to the t v  is the best possibility
yeah
and do we even uh prefer the sound above the the leds the lightning uh
function
it's a unique item uh
it will be an a unique feature of our remote control
yeah
and just about uh the user interface i came up with um an easy remote control and an advanced remote control what should we choose in in design
well the extra functions
used option

well so it just th the basic functions and we don't have to use it for d v d  players uh and all kind of stuff so
yeah just through uh the easy uh design we can make uh a nice design when when there's not mu uh much buttons in it so
uh just a few buttons trendy design nice lightning effects wh and the sound
yeah i don't know yet
but does it uh i then should n just use uh i instead of the stick uh like many cell phones just a round m well should we just use a
um it's already uh oh we have a blank
oh
it's just an easy uh way of of a round button what which can be pushed in four directions instead of a stick a stick is v vulnerab vulnerable
when it's falling down or uh just a round uh button should be the trick i think
yeah
geez
well volume and
something uh
like that
the programme up and down
and the vol yeah the pen doesn't uh really does what i want
but i think our our next step to look at is just that so i don't think it's um we have something to do uh we can't discuss it right now because n no one of us have has the information to discuss about that
i think
yes
mm hmm
'kay but teletext is so uh is just scrapped
the ten digits
oh and just one function the the the the programme to programme button the switch
to uh two channels when you have uh something on channel four and something on channel six
just one button which which can uh change yeah
yeah

alright
our b s c  uh w  uh
the ten digits yeah i believe so
yeah
i wouldn't buy it personally
a remote control without the ten digits uh and i think the most
just elder elder people would would buy it but
yep
the older people only use five of them
yeah
on the design
yeah
yeah
so we have to i to make um a decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition
mm hmm

twelve dollar fifty
i have nothing uh nothing to add i think
but the cheaper the ch uh the the chip or th what was it the circuit board
the fewer buttons you can use on it
yeah okay
yeah
well it then we should just uh take a look at the costs and uh especially for the voice recognition
no

we're done i think
me neither
interface industrial
yeah
uh the only problem is it that it depends on the divisions the decis uh decisions sebastian makes about the voice recognition well
yeah
yep
adapt
that's it
'kay
i'll take the lunch


is there any time for a cup of coffee can i get a cup of coffee okay

well during my work i have no time either so
i think so too

it is it is
yes
okay
excuse me
um
okay it's still the right thing
okay um well there are some changes in the
design requirements so there are some changes in the method also um basically all
this device has to do is send messages to a t v  set and the m most easy way to do this is by
uh sending pulses of infrared light to a t v  set well i th i tried to
uh implement a picture here but it's hardly readable
can you see it no well
um there's a energy source here and um basically there it's connected to three
things the user interface connected to a chip which is connected to the sender which generates messages
using uh infrared light which are sent to the receiver that's basically the idea and there's
a little picture just for your imagination how a device like this should look or can look
okay um what have i found usually these kind of things consist of a battery infrared
diode buttons chips and circuit board that's all it's cased together nothing more than that
it's almost every piece of equipment um
every piece of uh every t v  set is controlled infrared there are some exceptions but most
of all have uh infrared controls and uh the more luxury uh remote controls have lithium buttons
and i think that's what we w yes in the and it's a little more a little bit more fancy
also so maybe we should consider that okay i have a basic scheme
of the things uh which are implemented um basically this is
all there is there's just one chip there are a few buttons connected uh the buttons are lit and
the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode and there is not a power source here
so that's basically the total design of this piece of equipment there's nothing more to it it's fairly easy
it's been done many times before and i think we should uh we should c s succeed in in our
plan to do this so
okay so uh personally i think we should infra use infrared because uh otherwise our device cannot
uh communicate with uh almost every t v  set so i think that uh should be clear
uh another important point is uh we really should use uh energy uh sparse friendly components
uh there are specially uh designed um energy friendly components which consume
uh far less power than uh conventional components and um if we want to use uh
a rechargeable design or uh a energy save design we should really implement them
um for cost effectiveness we should really use a very low cost uh circuit board um because most
of the production cost are are in this uh part of the equipment and um the money we
save on using this we can use uh for elaborate fancy lighting uh techniques blinking leds and
all that kind of fancy stuff i think our uh users will really uh will really like that
no they're p f uh power friendly leds also so we can use them so that's no problem
uh no they're uh they're a little bit more expensive but by uh um um making
we can we can make its i think
okay
hmm
yes well it's not one light it there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device no no no no that's right that's right so well this uh should be it
um have a think about it




mm
or a find a finding function you know that's quite a yes
yes
yes
yes we should focus on that i guess well the technical uh there i think there are no technical
difficulties there's no um elaborate technique uh used in this uh kind of equipment so
um i don't think we have any hiccups there so we can fully concentrate on developing
a product that is really um what the market needs so maybe it's a good
idea to think about these buttons and and uh and a sound signal
well
yes th that's a bit of that's a problem usually
oh yes
yes well there there are some devices who uh incorporate this technique already um there are video sets
and um they have a special button the find the remote control button you press it and your t v  set
starts to make a uh kind of weird sound and your uh remote controls then start to beep and um
yes yes that's it
yes same thing
no so we we should use something else
we do not control the t v  set so well
yes m yes s and we b we want to make so it's is easy as possible for our customers so we should think about
it's quite complicated well it's quite complicated because how can you separate the clapping sound from other sounds
yes yes well basically the characteristics uh the characteristics of clapping is just an increase
in the volume the amplitude of the sound which is uh generated a few times within
a uh certain period of time but there are many other sounds uh which are exactly
the same from the point of view from a remote control
yes so we don't want that
maybe we can
something like that well is there not something f something more easily
well i don't think uh
no and y the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and
uh b uh perform a a some kind of uh and then uh the remote control
uh reports itself so w we should use have uh we should use something like that you do not want
another device which can be uh everywhere in the house which you have to find first before you can
find your remote control
yes something like that but that will be very costly i think so that's not a good idea
mm hmm
i will
yes
yes but um before i do that i w i want to warn you that uh by implementing
this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated um and it will become
more costly also because there will be additional components which which uh will be used
and there are some implepe imp
well i i think so because um when you have a p newspaper over your remote control you cannot see it so
okay
no no so that's out of the question so
i think also yes well we should save costs uh by not implementing a lot of functions
and uh the money that we can save from that we should use for uh having a nice design and uh
thinking about the user interface and
yeah that's right
mm
okay well is it maybe there's another possibility you can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment
but it's quite elaborated uh because it has many functions maybe it's more important to make
the make it look like a very uh friendly easy to catch piece of equipment but
um nevertheless
mm hmm mm hmm
ok like that well i was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling by by these kinds of sticks or something like that i don't know if if it's user friendly that's your field of expertise
mm hmm there's no but there's no way to do that because we cannot implement that kind of the system w
mm hmm
well maybe we can use a light for that when you move the stick to a to a position maybe uh a light next to it can lit up so you know i've just uh pushed the button or i changed the channel or t uh turned up the volume something like that
yes
oh yeah something like that
it's not really a stick but
yes yes
hmm
yes yes
and
yes and this also looks more fancy i think i think it it will attract uh
more uh uh public i think but you're the marketing man

okay that's good
mm hmm
okay
okay
do do you want a list of functions do you want an explicit list uh which uh incorporates all function available on the device
okay okay
mm hmm
mm hmm yes
change yes yes
yes
well you're the secretary
mm okay but make a s make a sub folder for it because it's starting to fill up already
sure
yes that's important
well are are you sure i'm not so sure
well that's complicated but is that so relevant because i don't think but you should uh shou you should know that
if it were so
okay i can imagine when
i can imagine when you're when you have a satellite decoder and and you have well about six hundred channels i can imagine
you want this but if you're uh a regular t v  user and you just want uh to watch the the dutch television networks
well you can uh you can use uh about ten buttons that's enough
well but how how often do you watch all these channels
no you're probably right
okay but i think these uh ten uh buttons look a bit dull don't you think
the design okay well y then there should be should done be done something specific with it
mm hmm
okay so you can experiment by uh with with shape or with size or with colour that kind of thing okay
well maybe it can be combined with the find the remote control so um when you add
uh speech recognition to your remote control uh it's very easy to change uh the channel
that's one thing and it's very easy uh to find your remote control
so maybe that's a possibility but i'm afraid it will be a bit costly but maybe when we uh
mm hmm
okay
okay okay
okay well i i think it should uh should work it sh we should manage that
yes well the voice recognition has the main adva has another advantage it's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find uh find the remote control button uh remote control function
so that's that's a big advantage i think
there's only one disadvantage uh by implementing this um the power saving
power saving will be a bit more difficult so we can expect that there
will be a less longer life to the batteries but maybe can we we can think something smart about
it there are some uh hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable
batteries so when you just leave the device in a in a light room it charges itself
you have to do nothing for it
maybe maybe not i'll have to find that out
yes so
no that's very cheap
it's oh it's very cheap that's no problem it's just a a case with two uh metal contacts
it's
yes but they're they're mass production they're very cheap so it will cost us p practically nothing

yeah
profitable
um i just want to make a summary of all all things uh spoken and uh the different possibilities um
so uh basically we've decided to implement a seemingly uh easy design so
on the outside it looks easy but uh we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside
so that's one the those are the choices we have to make but i think there's a big advantage in making
it more elaborate by uh implementing uh speech techniques uh voice recognition that these kinds of
things
um it makes it also more uh attractable i think to our uh audience
um there are some advantages and some disadvantages and the main advantage is that we can implement
uh fancy techniques which uh i think our customers will like the disadvantage is that there are
some concerns about uh the the costs and um the things like uh battery
lifetime energy saving uh another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not
do not implement these buttons
if we just add uh uh a chip which does the voice recognition uh our circuit board will become even
more cheap so that's another well it wa it w it was an issue but we also
thought that we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible and this even uh makes
it more cheapy so
mm hmm the circuit board
the fewer buttons you have the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board yes
and it's very cheap uh to incorporate uh uh an integrated circuit a chip so that's
that's another advantage
so
yes because i don't know
yes i d i really don't know so
it can be costly maybe not
yes
yes i al i i hope my personal coach will uh have a lo uh look at it
how nice
well we understand
well
mm yes
so we drop the voice recognition or oh
okay well um do we really have to decide now or can we decide next meeting
okay
because i'll have some updated info on that uh
adapt
we can have the lunch
hello
almost
uh if it if it if it's wireless i could just uh put it in the
uh okay
yeah uh b uh most

oh user friendly

well you could only lit uh the buttons the buttons that are used most so the channel switching
or
hmm true

oh mine is already outdated
since uh
okay make
well
uh then i'm sure the target market is uh ten million units
of of which we should sell about uh forty percent to make the five million
but um since uh the other part is uh forty percent of the market i uh thought
earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market but uh since
uh the requirements changed that's uh not a good idea
uh well skip this
well it's this till true of course that they only use ten percent the buttons the
buttons to zap are used the about uh fifteen hundred times when uh the power
button is only used one time and the volume button's only four times so they're obv obviously uh
the most important buttons and uh lots of people complained they kin can't find their remote control
so we might want to build in a feature to uh support them
some uh audio signal like uh home phones or
yeah
well i just said that and uh well this obvious and he also said it
uh that's about it yes
uh mo uh zap buttons most volume they are uh use a lot but
more than all the other buttons so
yeah that's uh a problem yeah
yeah
and you
yeah and usually
and even if the t v  set would have such a button uh you would have to walk to your t v  and it's

and b
so if if you'd be watching a movie it would constantly beep

yeah
yeah
i have the numbers r i have the numbers right here
well t uh we won't support teletext which which was the third most the second most used function

uh well yeah channel selection is obviously the most important
so
yeah yeah so
nope
uh well if we um include other uh innovative
functions uh then they uh might 'cause young people uh like new features so
and if you use that stick for volume control and channel uh selection you have the m two most important functions in one uh button
yeah
a younger uh huh
and it's also quite easy to use so it'll it uh attract younger people because well new and it might attract older people because it's easy to use

mielsen
yeah
well if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button
well
but
yeah and if if we
and if we are targeting at the younger audience they will probably watch more channels than the older people so
well
and
and um there are some numbers about uh speech recognition here that uh younger people would like it uh it might be expensive and uh hard to implement but it would be a solution uh
for
yeah
especially elder people uh don't like voice recognition so then we should implement such a but
yes
m

and uh if we if we could inc uh include a c a cradle in which it could recharge
then there wouldn't be uh a big problem 'cause when
yeah
um i think we dealt with the most important information just that the younger part of uh the market isn't the forty percent we uh
want to sell to
so we we should uh for least a bit uh look at the uh older people but with uh buttons like that which are easy to use we uh might attract them too so
i don't think that's a big problem
yes yeah profitable
yes
hmm
left
hmm
yeah
uh it fell off
one two three four yeah we're ready
okay welcome to this second meeting um it's now quarter after twelve and
we're given forty minutes um for this meeting this is a meeting on functional design
um and i wanna welcome you all and thank you all for doing some research in between
um i did took the minutes from the first meeting and i'll show them to you in a moment
um i know each of you have a presentation and um in thinking about the forty minutes
i thought it would take only like three minutes for the previous minutes um each of you having about seven
minutes or maybe a little more maybe a little less for your pre presentations and a little discussion
because there's i happen to have been told there were some new project requirements and we have to make some
uh decision on what functions it will have okay
is this ap everybody agree with this
okay um and after the meeting there'll be things to be done and
as you can see it says we get to get lunch um and then some more individual work and then putting
minutes away and individual actions um but uh
now for the minutes of the first meeting
and go to that one um as you can see it was this earlier today
um kate steph sarah and myself in our four capacities were present
i opened the meeting the product was developed uh and reviewed
and we talked about the financial end of it um and it had some implications um
the four million sales target and new ideas of not too many buttons
bright colours and some of the influence of the japanese and we closed early so you could
then proceed with your research and getting your reports together for tod this meeting
anybody have any questions on those minutes are they complete did they discuss everything that we covered last time
'kay
did i miss something
yeah i'm afraid i incorporated that when i said who was present but yes
we did and we did a little bit of uh team building of uh of making the pictures but i didn't think those were appropriate
to the minutes necessarily so um as a group i think we've
are they're accepting the minutes
and uh okay
yeah good um then we'll move to the three presentations
okay
okay
mm we need to move this who wants to go f first
that's as far as it goes
she said we didn't need to screw it in
it's doing its thing there we are
now in between as the project manager they sent me an email from the powers that be
um that teletext is outdated um and the internet is coming in as important
but that they want this remote control to only be for t v  um with incorporating
the corporate image colour and slogan
mm
hmm
okay
mm
is that a large enough target market to target it
in real numbers does the ninety one percent and the seventy six percent translate to ex in excess of the four million
or eight million
hmm
yeah
mm
mm


mm
but we're not looking at whether they're early adopters on that screen that's looking at age groups
leap
hmm
mm
okay you had the other power channel
okay
alright and we'll turn to the next presentation
i think she said we don't need to screw it in just stick it in
and then press what f f n  and f  eight next to the control button on the bottom and then f  eight at the top
and then w be patient
tada
there we are yay
okay
t v  only
ugh
hmm
mm
and exceed the requirements they're expecting of us
okay
alright
okay any uh thing else you wanna add okay
yeah let's hear what kate has to say
hmm
i think the white that one on the right is as well as less cluttered
it's there but it's
yeah
hmm

okay
hmm mm
hmm

okay
right but those things as long as we can get those components
the block that that rectangle for the user interface is where the user
comes in of what what does it look like what do the buttons look like uh what does it feel like
that's where the user interface is really coming into its own the technical end is
what's actually gonna be in there but also it has to be easy enough to
change or repair if something goes wrong
for example the battery energy source or um what
if the chip for whatever reason breaks down after a certain amount of time do you just replace it
um is there any um because it may be in the same area with several other
user interfaces like for d v d s movies whatever um does it have
to have a
a way of being segregated from the others in a different frequency or something
mm
okay
okay
oh
mm what they cost
okay
mm
mm
mm
okay
uh yeah
mm
it would have to sor store up the energy
and then use it solar can do that
m yeah that would be too heavy and it'd cost too much
mm
mm
yeah
and the dock could look very fancy and that could be your inspiration of having it looking decent
hmm
yeah okay are we agreed as to what our target group is though
pretty much so that we'd be looking for the younger end
mm
i i s usually put more money than brains
mm
yeah or do we s make sure that it goes to the man through the manufacturer we sell to the manufacturer as the remote that goes with it
what would be a more efficient way of doing it
mm hmm
okay right
probably not um the other thing that we're supposed to
do is make decision on our functions
our functions we've so far decided i think that power channel volume
make it attractive um it has to have an enter key and of course the number keys
it has to have big user friendly buttons and sh n
definitely we wanna be inspired that the current
styles are just plain awful
is that agreeable to everyone
mm hmm
throw some light on that
um actually we're you know we are almost a half hour out of the forty minutes so we have to get close to finishing
ah mm hmm
okay
enter power as a s oh um a sum simultaneous key
is that okay with you
would that uh huh
then you'd have to have an off te off key
mm
mm
okay
mm
okay
so i guess easy to use is the other thing that we want 'em to be able to do as you said you know
don't make it too hard for the granny i just joined that set last week
um first grandchild arrived um
so are we agreed then of those things and
let's go back to agenda and hook me up
mm this oughta be fun it probably won't go the first time it'll probably be like a g mess
come on
uh it lost it off here uh
no it was up there but i couldn't see it down here
mm
this time it should be both
there we go
um you have to keep doing the financi the the f n  and f  eight to
five minutes to finish thank you a lot for telling me um right
we're ready to close um will be completed q questionnaire
um then we'll have some time for individual work to continue our research um
and i'll put some minutes of this meeting together um your individual assignments
are for
um kate to do the components for
you steph to do the user interface and for you the trend watching
um and each of us will get help from our coach are we agreed to
get ourselves together and then have lunch okay then that's the end of this meeting
and i hope that's good enough for her to tell her that's the end okay
well i think i went over the functions and wrote them down and marked them um that's what i went over and nobody was objecting to them
okay
um the teletext is outdated the internet is important
it's only to be for a t v  and it must include the corporate image colour
and slogan um which i think is more in the user uh range with steph
it doesn't tell me
mm hmm
okay
oops
uh i think so we we we talked about the the individual roles that we each had as well
okay
oy big loop under the table
could can i ask where these figures come from is this market research we've
mm hmm

um
how d i'm wondering how how ou how our target price compares with the the typical price
of these things i expect an industrial designer should know that but if we're aiming to to build this thing for twelve euros
fifty um is that a lot or a little
sh surely he's in the wrong age group he must be w one of a s small population
and if you want it to go into slide show mode it's that little button there
i you can if you like it it that that just sets it up to do a p a p no that one that one there
left left a bit left a bit that one yep and then you just press the click when you wanna go on
cheers
mm i haven't actually got a display on my screen still i'll do without that okay um now i wanna bring us down to earth again i'm afraid and talk about the actual practicalities of how the thing needs to work
um oh and this is the methodology i used in preparing for this meeting
um basically i've been doing a little bit of web based research and if i had a design
team i would've been discussing my ideas with 'em but the the net result is that i've come
up with a first cut for the working design that i'd like to discuss with you
so let's go back to what the basic function of a remote control is it's for sending a message
um typically um via infrared and the
the basic components we've got to build in for our twelve euros fifty are um an energy
source the user interface and
which will um in incorporate um an integrated circuit
that actually composes the message um based on what the which buttons the user presses we turn that
into a message um and then we need a sending mechanism to send it to the receiver
now i would have hoped i think that's my only slide actually yeah i would have have hoped to um
do you a pretty powerpoint slide of um my first cut design but unfortunately the technology defeated me so if you'll bear with me i'll do it on the whiteboard
so we want an energy source
which is there
and we've got to think about what that might be uh we obviously don't want wires on this thing uh typically it would be a battery but i'm open to suggestions um and
then we have the the user interface
oops
and the main components in there are the
the th the chip that actually has the intelligence of the machine that translates button presses into a message which it then
transfers to some sending mechanism which encodes it
and sends the message to the receiver so those are the basic things that we've got to get in for our twelve euros fifty thank you
mm hmm
well i may be wrong here but i'd been thinking of this device as being a a cheap mass produced device we're trying to
sell four million of 'em um that's that's you know that's almost one in every tenth household
or whatever it is um and i hadn't thought of it as being a reparable thing you just if it goes
wrong you chuck it out and that's why i'm a bit concerned i like the idea of speech recognition that's a great idea but i'm not convinced
we can put it into this box for the price that we need gonna need to hit

um
i'm i'm i'm hoping that my personal coach is gonna give me some advice on that if you're asking me but
yeah
well i uh think that's a very interesting idea but um i'm not a very good industrial designer and i don't know much about what these things cost i'll do some research for the next meeting
well solar may not be so good when you're watching t v  in the night but
yeah i guess
we may be talking quite heavy then
mm hmm
so do you think we might make that a selling point if it was something that we found we could afford to develop

mm
yeah i was wondering that because i ag i agree that there there're people with uh how can i put it more money than sense and who are liable to buy something new but
bu but what i was gonna say was although they they may be buying um you know personal music devices and all
that are they necessarily buying t v  remote controls because they probably live in a household that has a t v  if
they're at the lower end of the age range i don't know
mm i think we've got a big hill to climb here haven't we i mean we've gotta persuade people who've got a remote control 'cause it came with the telly that they should buy our product instead
right good point yeah yeah okay yeah
yeah yeah good point
mm hmm
do you want the gizmo
h how does that work how so so how does that work how do you avoid switching the thing off when you actually wanna press enter
okay yep mm hmm
it's not getting a bit complicated
could granny do this or are we just not aiming at granny

mm
uh
how do you do that how do you make it do both
ah okay it toggles through yeah

yeah
sounds good
okay
so we're still in meeting aren't we
okay
yes
yeah i do
uh not really meant to touch those microphones oh it doesn't have any on does it that's fine
uh it definitely needs uh a lot more research on like how much more it would be and any you know existing examples and what reactions to them have been and that sort of thing
yeah press them
yeah here we go
can i not just uh
do each one in order
that
that
that
right technical functions design
uh well i think first off basically i do agree with what sarah
has defined as as uh your personal preferences yeah i think we need uh
a more streamlined volume with no extraneous functions
so my method was to look at the existing remotes and what functions they have and what we all need to discuss is whether we want these functions
uh pretty much the same as what existing remotes have if we can build on this with the speech recognition that's not something i'd thought about at all but it's also something we can discuss
um and and i presume we can miss out the functions really to to a video or d v d  remote control if this is only gonna be a you know satellite cable t v 
remote control so these are two models of existing remote controls
uh the one on the left
seems to be a fairly
uh standard universal remote control it has fast forward stop play all relating
to movies it also has seems to have channel up and channel down which is
which is more what you'd expect from a you know like a sky or cable remote control where you've got hundreds
of channels instead of a merely terrestrial one
uh but i think we should be looking more along the lines of the one on the right which has it also has play stop and pause and everything i don't think we need them at all
i think we just need channel selection
volume up volume down and
i think an an enter function where you can access it's not like teletext but along the same lines access things on the screen uh
not related to the internet one that you mentioned because that'd be far outside our budget and what we want this to do
so it really exceed the requirements 'cause the requirements really are just want to be able to change channels and functions which
is more a text on the screen thing than uh than actual buttons o i
was thinking something some smooth sleek little remote control
with big user friendly buttons and uh a menu that you can access
uh but then i do think we need to discuss the speech
um recognition possibility
no
but we could go back to the pictures of the
uh what're they called
the pictures of the remote controls
and possibly discuss what we think about them but maybe should hear what kate has to say first
okay then
definitely less cluttered and i mean but still it's
sorry i was just i'll just uh resume something else i was gonna say the the style of these is terrible i i i really think we need to uh
not only possibly even materials like the type of plastic used but everything including size and shape of buttons positioning of buttons the actual shape of the hand held device colours
just every e yeah everything to do with this has to be revolutionised
but
so that's that for now
whoop
isn't that your job
oh right
yeah
it does it does seem as if we're just to do something really simple and mass produced the which is pretty much the same as these existing models just maybe
a little bit more inspired
but basically just the same although what what uh suddenly came into my head is you know how they always take two a a  batteries which which is really not very efficient at all
could it be possible to have uh you know like a rechargeable internal battery like
well like an m p  three player does with that you could jus or a mobile phone or whatever you could you know
you just plug into a power source for a couple of hours and then it's recharged for ages and ages and ages and you don't have
to worry with replacing a a  batteries which are
you'd never need uh batteries would y uh yeah
and it's not stuck down the back of the sofa but then again i d i don't know if this is within our price range or not

well it is just so annoying how
no but just a rechargeable internal battery would probably i mean it might cost more to at first
to develop and to install but for long term use it'll be so much more convenient
and economic than fiddling around trying to replace chunky a a  batteries
and not having any in your kitchen drawer and
you know f
mm sort of have its little dock that you could put it in
still i don't know if it's quite within our price range
yeah
yeah
yeah
that's probably more what it is
we're not gonna get any resolutions by the end of the day are we
yeah
sorry i was miles away i was re i was reading the chart to be honest
who's got an ipod then
yeah things like screen settings and audio settings i would generally
do them on the actual television itself like here you have a
you know a little flap th with a little control panel on the actual box itself i i wouldn't know how to do it using a remote control so
um i would say that they are definitely less relevant

yes
we didn't come to any sort of decision on the functions though
alright well that's fine then
mm
sorry what what actually are these is that the yellow and black
from their i'll just use it from their website
okay
yes
mm hmm

okay i accept the minutes
is that what we're supposed to say
okay
excellent thank you
okay
okay that looks good
alright thank you very much um
one of the the biggest issues i found about um from last meeting was the fact that we need to sell four million of these um
remote controls and i think that this is an opportunity to really take real reaction in the direction of of similar
of handheld tools that have been used and are used by many of us and to kind of bring the remote
control into the si same realm as an accessible um useful
electronic device as opposed to something that is lost in the couch and what have you so um
my main goal here is to re envision the remote control in in this context and to think
about menu functionality and current technology and the fact that it could be interactive with other tools
um some of the research uh in the market has shown that people really are not happy with remote
controls as they are now and um that means we do need to
make some decisions about what what keys or or buttons on the on the remote
control to perhaps keep and and what ones to discard and if we devote some
energy into this i think the um recent productions of real reaction the
i go everywhere power and the high definition d v d  players although it makes
immediate sense to have our remote control interact with these i think we can also use
this as a platform to make it interact with other tools and um in fact i think the high definition
d v d  players and all of this will come along in the uh will only benefit from the positive feedback
from our well designed tool so again most uh users really dislike
the current look and feel of remote controls um fifty percent i think of all these uh
numbers the most important is fifty percent of user say they only use ten percent of the buttons and eighty
percent of users and if we think about this there are a lot of uh television d v d 
stereo remote control users out there eighty percent would spend more money on a remote control that
looks fancy
um it was market research and there were a hundred people in the room so eighty out of a hundred said they would spend more money
mm hmm
mm hmm
well i think we can i i think we can really focus on this remote and
and again bring the real reaction um brand in in and and get some
positive marketing for our other tools even if we directly don't um
advertise for the i go everywhere line
so an interesting um element was the would you pay
more for speech recognition question so these market research uh uh
questionnaires looked into your your uh concern about technology and s
specifically wanted to
find out information about speech recognition
now
the early adopters those of us who grew up with technology and uh luck
lucky for us have the uh cash to to pay for it the young age
group without the mortgages and responsibilities ninety one percent of them
would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control very interesting i i leave this up to the
group to decide if we wanna use this uh if and you know the the designers but ninety one percent
fifteen to twenty five
well i i i think especially in terms of growth i think this would be a very smart
group to target i mean s three quarters of the next age group twenty five to thirty five are interested and
uh with the technologies improving if we can get these uh
yeah
to
um yes
yes but would you pay more and does it work and is it approachable and
and did i know that it was it was an that's a that's a very good question i don't know if speech recognition
should be um should be included but i think it's an interesting i think that maybe shows more about
uh
being open to technology
shall i go back
yeah yeah
yeah
exactly i mean i i i uh did not receive any information on that but i think the competition
sussing out what other people are doing and what's in the pipeline is very very important
because um there is a question about do you want an l c d  screen and and
that wasn't responded to but uh some of the larger
remotes do have screens where you can navigate you know so it turns into something uh
perhaps you all have seen uh the osbournes where ozzy osbourne is is attempting to manage his
super entertainment system with something that looks like a uh a small tray you know it's
i a and i think you know
no no you kate you're exactly right there but i think the key is to get the early adopters people who are familiar with technology and and uh they'll be
uh mm
exactly i yes and i'm making and i'm making the the uh uh
leap that people who are familiar younger people are l are more familiar with technology than
than older people or comfortable you know um so
i think the most important thing is an attractive streamlined remote control and to be extraordinarily reductionist power channel volume and everything else is is uh
up to the designers
and this is this is also supported by the market research
thank you that's my contribution
or if
yeah
maybe afterwards we could do a uh whiteboard with that your the one on the right as a as a
basis
whiteboard session
mm hmm

the ergonomics the way it fits in your
yeah
do we have um
ki some idea of how much it would cost to create a device that has these basic elements because then
no the chip composer marketing oh no the chip composer sender
i i don't believe i know um
okay
be because then we would ha ha figure out how much we had to play with in terms of user interface and this look and feel idea
mm hmm
inspired
mm
mm hmm
mm hmm
well that has another element which is if every time you're done using the remote you put it on a charger then you then it has a place
yeah but it also has a place so exactly
that's a really good idea
well it's better than my idea about solar probably yeah yeah depen
mm yeah
yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
definitely 'cause i'm thinking in terms of um uh
the
loss and breakage of um remotes how much of that is is to do with it not really having a
uh a home a um a nest a place to live exactly
so if you can dock it um you know you could s argue that this is
exactly
mm 'cause you are talking about another component like another piece of hardware
mm
well i i brought up some exactly but i think you raised some good questions about are there enough of these people out there or are they making purchasing decisions you know these are the
yeah exactly
oh oh oh i'll make a note of that kate good good comment
yeah
it might be good to know um uh who you know who's actually buying televisions and are we in a uh uh s
region where people have more than one television in a home
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah and and some of our d v d  players incidentally have them because we have the relationship with our own department but moreover we need to
to go for the the manufacturers
mm
do we need um let me
br actually um
the enter key i have a chart here that i didn't include um
yeah which might
th yeah th those are
felt like had a lot of charts
okay i i my only comment is i think maybe um we could somehow include an enter key in like a power key if power power was enter and pow that was my only just really in terms of streamlining
um
exactly again you know thinking of menus or

um
well if you're pressing enter the the thing would already be on and so maybe um
when you press power initially it turns it on press power again and use that as an enter
um so you press power after you've um well i was thinking maybe you to turn it off
you'd have to press power twice in succession and maybe power follows something like
a channel up channel down power and then that would make that choice
well
or y yeah or something that has a a turning dial where at the far end
is on or off yeah i don't um i wish anyway uh
that was the only comment about um some of the the decisions
people have made what's most important it's definitely channel volume power
exactly
exactly
yeah
okay well thanks for looking at that
mm hmm
we don't wanna outsmart
hmm
congratulations
d
oh you're fine
it's fine
i think you have to cycle through
okay
um and you'd mentioned i i was just gonna say could you reiterate the new project requirements because it they were it has to be for a t v  just to keep myself
yeah i think i've
okay
mm
right thank you
okay so now um last time can you uh push the button one time please so
i'm still the secretary
now uh i ask you to presentate the prototype one of your you two
yes the prototype
well thank you uh now

yes
okay
mm hmm
okay and the buttons
and the joystick is for the volume and the channels

okay so if joystick and l c d 
what's the r r  d

okay very good
so we have
so what they say on the side is put fashion there yes
it's good so that's it that's prototype
now the finance
we don't know if it's th it if it's okay so i'm gonna look we have sorry
finance is um yeah it's
no first uh
yes we have to evaluate the product yet sorry

criteria
no it's okay
oh it's okay
what do you think
yeah
two
you
me too so it's a three
so it's a
yes it's for the
younger g group so it's uh half half of the people
so i think it's four
no
yes so i think it's four
okay give it a four yep
we put the fashion in electronics

uh i say uh a five it's not fashion it's new
it must be a fashion
but it isn't yes it w if it's not a fashion
we can put it in it so it must be a fashion i think it's a five

no oh i use my feet though

okay

well i say three so counting then is two and a half
okay two

you
me too one
next six
it does not get lost easily
no we did not so but can it get lost if it's such a thing i don't think so
yes not a not a normal shapes so
no
it won't get lost so
a one
okay a one next

yeah me
that was our target two
yep right
there's a fancy look and feel
okay
i say a two
it's a a bit personal if it's fancy so i think s two is better
no it's new innovation
okay
me too three
yeah
effort is three ten and twelve thirty forty fifty twenty one so it's uh two and three nine two and one third
yep
uh nah
okay
so it's good
okay thank you
okay back to my uh
yep
next please so now uh we have a product very happy but uh is it cheap enough
um so if uh i'll have a look we have a battery one battery
okay one battery electronics advanced chip
yeah it's the most advanced chip on print
we have that one
we have the simple regular and advanced
we have the adva advanced 'kay so uncurved or flat nope single curved or double curved we have double curved
so
then we have plastic wood rubber we have half rubber half plastic
no titanium special colour
yes yellow
interface push button
scroll wheel integrated scroll wheel push push button or l c d  display so we have the l c d 
we have two scroll wheels or one
and it's not really a s
yeah it's this one now uh button supplement special colour we already uh that's the from the for the buttons the buttons are regular colour
so then uh then then then then then then
then
uh no it's too expensive
so we have to change something fifteen euros
yeah well uh when we lose one scroll wheel it's okay
'cause we can't lose the battery we can't lose the advanced chip we can't lose the double curve
we have rubber special colour
oh no we no it's uh
sorry
um then we uh lose
two euros then we have thirteen euros half a euro too much
exactly the special colours
so
that's one euro
so i don't think that's good
mm
i think we have to keep the l c d 
if
yes
then it's
only thirteen euros
so uh yeah
yeah then you have or you have to cut this off
then it's not good anymore so wait okay i'll have a look
we
yellow rubber
yeah normal
uh
one minute please uh is it maximum um
yeah it's normal colour
but if you lose the
joystick it's still uh an advanced chip
or it's then a regular
so the advanced is for the l c d  and the regular for the joystick
and what if we lose the l c d 
yeah regular chip but
is it a good design
mm yes
then it's okay
okay so no joystick oh no but we then we get push buttons from half a euro
uh yes yes yes yes no joystick push buttons
no special colour twelve and a half euros
then it's okay so we have to change that a little bit
and you cannot use the red and green button because if you give them a s uh colour
you have to pay
point two euros
yes
yes
so
so well
now we have to change that but that's okay rubber what's the normal colour

so
and
where's
yeah
so now it's
yeah it is but then it will be
just that ones
now it's
very good now uh project eva evaluation well
what do you think of it uh

about the project

okay and you
okay
okay
well what do i have to say i think it was good not too many discussions so it's good for the speed
so i think we're ready good price evaluation ready
ready


that's it

oh this you mean
yes well uh
this is it

it's uh it's uh it's yellow and uh this is rubber
and and and this too
the
the sides and the rest is hard plastic
and uh
we uh we had some uh we had a new idea that that this can uh can be uh uh turned inside and then it covers the these buttons
until here or something and then you can still use the the power button and the mute and the the joystick
so you can still operate uh all the things because you don't always use the menu
and then it can break
uh well uh
big buttons and everything is blue except the power button and the mute of uh yeah and the mute and the the other button yeah
channel higher channel button
uh yes yes that's uh
very obvious
yeah
r r 's the l the the the the company uh logo
uh yes yes that's about here
oh
three
mm
mm four
yeah but it's it's
yeah i mean it still has l large buttons and not m many buttons so i mean the colours are for young people but
older
yeah
yeah maybe
yes two
then make it th three



yes a one i like it
one
yes
yeah but uh
yeah
yeah
yes a one

yeah okay
mm three
yes

mm hmm
mm yes
mm yeah
mm yeah
yeah
okay all the same uh
mm yeah
recognisable like what yeah
mm yeah
okay


yeah well the same i i espe i especially uh liked the the means the the smartboard and uh
yeah it uh
it brings up new ideas when you work with uh with it
yeah
mm hmm
no

i don't care
huh


big
yes

up is channel up down is channel down to the right is volume up to the left is volume down
the r r 


i'll get it
i think the scroll button is something also uh new
what uh not anoth uh not a lot of uh a lot of uh remote controls have i think technologically i'll give it an
seven si six six sorry six
oh true or false oh uh i'll i'll give it uh a t a two sorry
five
mm hmm
maybe version uh three point o  uh has other colours
four
me too a two because only the battery is not uh
techin uh technologically high standard but the rest of it is so i think a two
it it will be fashion

'kay three is okay
oh we'll wait outside

i give it a one
say two two

one

uh just a small thing
ah yellow looks like a pistol uh
it won't get between uh the pillows uh on the couch
uh
yeah o one
yeah me too
two yeah yeah
i gave this a one because of the rubber it feels soft uh it looks like a l uh uh b uh a bit like a joystick it's yeah yeah f very fancy trendy
two is okay
oh
i go for two because uh the the shapes are still round uh the latest trends are soft things you know like uh i said in my presentation uh
but the the colours are um basic like yellow red um blue something what also younger people want it's also a trend so i'll give it a two
two

yeah i think
cheapest there is
expensive
well it's the most advanced
advanced



uh yellow

one
joystick uh thing

we're not gonna make it
yeah wh
what what are the costs

fifteen
a special colour uh i don't think it's a very special colour
yellow uh is it a special colour
what
yeah
and what if we use only one sort of um
um just only plastic or only rubber
one euro discount

if we change the joyst uh the joystick thing into a button up button down button right button left
and then we'll lose fifty cent in what
uh uh uh
no
and if you say it's just a r uh normal colour it's a normal colour wh no one will see it
normal colour and the the joystick away and put the button up button down right left
and it's twelve euros i think
no uh no no no uh
oh wait wait wait
oh yeah
oh yeah
yeah yeah yeah
if we lose the l c d  then we have an uh regular chip and no l c d 
uh yeah then you'll have to m uh see the menu on the television and you don't have
the l c d 
so the t v s has to uh have to be up to date
yeah
yeah
huh no knew that
yeah then it's twelve euro fifty then it's okay
so all the buttons has to have to be the same colour but then the print on it will g um change it make it uh
for everybody to see what button it is uh l how you call it
recognisable yeah
yeah
okay

oh well that's clear
and the joystick away
and its buttons
yeah

about the
process went good
uh
i think uh the creativity uh was good enough we have a gun instead of a remote control um
uh leadership yeah you were the project project manager and uh had the final vote so yeah that was clear
team work okay everybody uh has something uh to say about it
and uh no uh o only the the drawing uh was very difficult
but nah new ideas found
nope
no
yep
beer

yeah okay then
this is it
yes
yeah
that's on the rub rubber part
yeah
alright
do we do we change the
do we change the the order or are we going to uh ev evaluate it first
okay that's uh um that can be none
um we gonna do the evaluation now together but i have uh a introduction how it works so it will come up
uh oh okay
um yeah well we uh uh i have um thinked a few evaluation uh
criterias uh based on um our marketing strategy on
uh the latest trends on user preferences
uh we have a seven point scale from uh true as well to false seven and on
base of each c uh criteria we need to um give a rating we can uh well it look
like this but we gonna uh do it here they said so you hope found
out how to do it with a word document
yeah
okay yeah yeah um well uh we have the word document
you so we open up that blank here um

think i can uh what this just an example so this not very important but um if i can
get a number in here
hmm
well uh we can't do that
um so uh you have to think of it as uh the remote control is techno technologically innovative
uh and then we have to uh agree on the rating together
and in the end we will c uh count an average
of all rating the first uh on each item
yeah i think it's uh uh well technologically using it's not uh it doesn't contain many new features only the l c d 
so it um i think i will give it a yeah yeah yeah a four hmm

so now i i think you uh see it um its statement and you true or false and true is one
so yeah yeah
'kay um well
it's a one the first item
so okay the second item um this product is for all sorts of customers
well it's a statement which uh i disagree with because we uh really aim uh at at young market and i think the way it looked uh c uh totally in yellow it's not uh really aimed for all customers it doesn't look like that
that's uh a six


four uh okay mm
that's uh the motto of our company
yeah well do we do this with uh this product
i um yeah i think if we do this as it's uh uh c uh it's really orientates on the design um so i would give it a two
two
uh okay
okay yes i'll think of that too yeah agree

a three
yeah okay
the next element um is the product looks good well personally i do not prefer a um remote control that's fully in yellow so i would give this a five

we have to do our uh two or three two okay
so well we gonna do the next part uh yep
uh uh the next statement it has not too much buttons um yeah i i have uh said is not because uh a low number is better and in the end we calculate an average
so um that's why it's a negative in it
um well this one of our aims not have too much buttons so um uh did we uh do that
well uh if we go to uh this fashion i we still have caused
uh a lot of uh buttons for the numbers
but you can you can go for that and um that way you don't have a lot of buttons over so i would give this a two
one
um but where where is the
so
yeah did we implement uh the sound


yeah
it won't
one
okay um well we aimed for the younger market uh yeah did we achieve that i think with the way it looks and um it is designed i will give it a two
yeah
uh yes that that was uh yeah one of the most important things that uh trendwatch said i didn't uh say it in my presentation but um well does it have that
i would say yes so um
well let's also give this a two t

yeah
okay two and um then the last one i could think of uh it goes with the latest trends
if we looked at the latest trends for the uh younger people and they ate uh fruit and vegetables well it has a um a nice colour uh well compared to food but we didn't uh
we did not paint any uh fruit and vegetable on it for something like that so i would did not give this uh a one or two i we'll go for a three
yes
a three
okay so um come back to the presentation now so we find yourself there and now we have to calculate an average rating so we will do that yes
by nine
yeah um uh okay
two
come on
so uh that's a pretty low rating i think

so according to our uh own evaluation uh we did a good job
oh nah how am i doing yes
and i closed your slide show
which one was the last for you uh dreaming
next
finance

yeah
one
we would have uh n
for a remote control i've for a remote control i think it is
if we would have uh uh normal buttons instead of uh the joystick
for up down left right
the advanced chip was for the l c d  wasn't it
if uh
if we have the n no buttons if we have we have uh not a joystick but buttons we would have uh we have thirteen euros
and then uh we move the the colour what will that be
yeah

still he waited at the
no

project
yeah i think you have to compare it to if you would have a normal um normal project without laptops uh and without these devices i think um
well the laptops if you have them out front of you you sometimes looking at that instead of the presentation um well uh the draw board well you can draw things but it not really going very convenient
uh maybe it will be easier if you have a smaller monitor and uh you would also see there and with a normal mouse
um and uh the project yeah i agree on what was said uh mainly uh yeah but you always have that some people are talking more than others
and maybe is then um the task of the the project manager to also uh ask more to the people uh less talking
to tell their opinion
yeah

okay
okay
right
okay
alright is everyone here okay this is our conceptual design meeting
and
i'll just take a few minutes and uh go through the previous minutes um then each of you will have your presentation um and then we will need to make a decision on the concept for the remote control
and then we'll have uh forty minutes for finishing up um
i'll go through the mee through the minutes first um we just refreshed
our our uh goal of making the finest remote control
available um we decided that or we know that we need to use
company colours company logo um and
our marketing expert uh gave us some i uh information from interviews with
a hundred different remote users um with some statistics that backed basically what we were
thinking before people thought their remotes were ugly um
um
that remotes zap a lot um they only use uh a finite amount of buttons
um and that they often lose the it's easy to lose a remote um which were all things we were thinking we would wanna make it simple um
and uh some sort of locator either a button or tracking device um
and that it should look different than what's out there
um
kind of mixed mixed response on the speech recognition the younger people said they wanted it older people did not um uh i think we decided that
um the expense was not necessarily worth it and that it was probably a gimmick
that um would increasingly wear on the consumers' nerves
um
then the user interface designer um explored
some of the technical functions of the remote um the simple versus the
um the complex the simple one being better for a user the complex better for an engineer
um
um and some personal preferences that were found in that would be that it should be a user oriented
remote something simple um and that we didn't wanna go with a universal remote because
uh increasing cost and increasing complexity um we would just have a t v  remote
um and that we should also focus on the appearance of the remote
have it s be something that looks different
and finally our um industrial designer uh gave
us a rundown of how the remote will work um from energy source um
uh what we would use batteries because we don't wanna have a a cable um
how that would power the remote and the lamp if we were to to have one
uh um the user interface then would connect to a chip which would work with the infrared
controls uh to send the signal to the t v  um
i believe then we came up with a couple of ideas for what we think the design of the remote will be um
um something that will fit into uh easily into someone's hand
and with a just a few buttons just the basics and with a scrolling um function also
okay and i will leave that leave it at that so
marketing we're watching trends i suppose that you can have this
a banana shape

so possibly like a uh sorry just to butt in for a second possibly uh like a cover like they have for mobile phones
you have one with a flag and one with a banana and one that's a spongy
feel to it you can
mm various covers
we could leave that to the cover department

we all know they've got nothing to do all day


notice the giant dog bone shape also good for animals

what's the approximate per hundred thousand for the titanium



works well in arizona but in edinburgh not so
no i think i think batteries are probably the way to go
yeah
so the ru wait the rubbery we can shape it however we want or the rubbery we cannot
'kay
mm
mm
yeah
is that an option a plastic shell with a rubbery coating on at certain spots
what about a smell t to the remote
yellow and grey
grapefruit
i would say if i were to make a decision i would probably put the fruit aspect at the lower lower end of the spectrum of of importance
um

well perhaps the implied shape will be enough to lure that fruit minded remote buyer
it's it's yellow it's curved
it's sort of couple of couple of grey stripes we could put the grey stripes on the bottom so that that person could turn it over it would look like a banana just sitting on their table
rather than rather th
maybe the holder if we were to have a holder it could be shaped like a fruit could be it could be an ape or a fruit bowl hey we could have a variety of options here

do you have more to your presentation
oh
okay i'm gonna plug in here real quick if i could
like i said we have to make a decision on
a couple of these items here um ow ow
mm hmm
okay uh so these are the decisions that we do need to make
by the end of this meeting um for our components concept we need to come up with the energy source
um the chip on print and the case
probably case um material and probably a shape also
um and then for the user interface concept we need to decide what the tape what what the type is and what kind of supplements we'll have
um
energy source i think we've i think we've decided batteries although not exciting are probably our best bet
and we have five minutes
'kay
so
um i guess we should pick the case then if we go with the plasticky case or the the plastic case um
then the chip on print is still kind of we could have either or we could have a complex one or a a non complex but did we decide that the rubbery feel was important enough to us
okay so we would we would have the l c d  screen
'kay
so i guess the case would be plastic with
perhaps that's not even enough rubber to qualify as being part of it it's more of a su it's more of a supplement maybe
which will require a more expensive chip on print right
'kay so
i guess that is that is that about it so we have a good idea of what we're gonna need to to do on this
um okay so we will have another meeting in thirty minutes um
here's what's gonna be going on um
um ryan you'll be working on the user interface design um
manuel you'll be working on the look and feel design
corrine we'll want a product evaluation
and the two of you get to play with the uh modelling components and uh
maybe and and get us a prototype
which should go along well with your look and feel design and your interface so that basically just be working on the prototype uh we'll accomplish your other two actions
alright okay let's do it




alright




that's industrial design for cranes stuff like that
makes sense makes sense

uh
well let's see i'm going to bore you with a
couple of descriptions of the interior
just to to make it more obvious what we have to fit in there and that we do have to fit the stuff
in there i've more information on possible materials um
as well what we can and cannot do
um but let's just wait for this to load up and i'll show you
what we're talking about here okay
the details of the components' design as you can see there what we have is the board
main board of the remote control the underside that's pretty cheap
piece of of technology really top left side you can see the chip which is the
what we were talking about this was is the device to recognise the signals the input and
it passes it on to a row of um further
transistors and stuff like that on the right side that actually amplify the signal which later on is being
is being transferred to a infrared lamp which
then um of course shines infrared light onto the television which then will recognise
what signal um it's getting and will do what you tell
it um
so much for the the workings of the
of the uh
remote control itself its job is to wait for you to press a key then to translate that key press into infrared light signals um that are received by the television
when you press a key um you complete a specific connection the chip senses the connection and knows what button you pressed it produces a morse code line signal specific to that button right pretty clear
transistor amplifies the signal and then sends the m sends the signal to the l e d  which translates the signal into infrared light the sensor in the t v  can see the infrared light and seeing the signal reacts appropriately
this is the circuit board from the other side um the lower part of it i
don't know if you can see that properly with the green greenish board is is what we what we saw in the first
the first slide just flipped over
um you can see the circuit board itself that's the cheapest uh way to make electronic
connections basically on the market um what you do is you have don't have
cables but you have the connections actually in these in these lines on the on the board
these are the actual keys that are being pressed they close the electric circuit that then sends the signal to the chip on the other side that would be behind here um which uh sends it over to the transistors and all that stuff that
amplify the signal and all that is being sent to the infrared lamp up there
now as you can see this is the the rubber button version of it um the way it works is that you have the keys
here the rubber button has a little metal uh plate on the other side which closes the circuit here
and thus gives on the signal now this is the simple version
um we are talking um this this the simple and cheapest version
at the same time we are talking something more complicated of course it's going to be more expensive
as well
and not only that um we are also restricted in the use of
our outer shell or in the material that we could use for our outer shell
um i've gotten some information that
we could use for the case material plastic
rubber as well um rubber that is used in these anti stress balls so it's pretty squishy that would that would serve that purpose um we could also use wood or titanium
oh fya i don't have an information on that however our company obviously can provide us with
uh with the titanium so i assume i'm i was given an okay to use it it certainly
is an expensive material i'm aware of that but i was given an okay
but there are certain restrictions to certain materials now let's first go through the list with the materials so we what we can use is plastic rubber wood and titanium can also mix these
um as for the energy source um we were talking about that shortly
in the other meeting um what we could use is or what i was offered or what we could use
is a basic bateer battery right
uh a dynamo
interestingly enough
um we could use solar cells
or a device that was not n not further specified that provides kinetic energy such as like watches you know where you just move them
m move the the actual device and this pr uh provides it with with uh some energy so um obviously
i personally have to say that dynamo is out of the question really you don't wanna wind up your remote control before you can use it right um solar cell is interesting may fail though every here and there
mm yeah or you know you lose it it lies behind the couch for a week and yeah mm
always the you
but exactly um the kinetic energy thing um
might work um but the same problem you leave it lying around and you first have to shake it before it
it starts to work so i'd say what we're stuck with really is um the basic battery
which also makes a base station basically obsolete we don't need that then
um
however
our interface options are push buttons in which uh in the production of which or in manufacture of which um our company is expert
um
however we've discussed that scroll wheels are a better option and they are possible we have an okay for scroll wheels okay um however when it comes to the scroll wheel of the ipod
i've one big objection and that is that we have to fit an l c d  into the remote control as well this
however may exclude certain um materials if you have a squishy uh
kind of remote control then an l c d  screen may be affected by the movement hence we
might not be able to put it in there so um
there's also restrictions to when it comes to the chip if we have a more sophistic
uh sophisticated scroll wheel rather than this very basic uh set up that we that i've just presented
um the chip has to be more s more sophisticated and thus more expensive as well i don't have any details to when it comes
to the cost but um it will be a significant difference
i'd rather say drop the titanium and therefore let's have a more sophisticated chip but that's not up to me to decide really
so that's for the for the scroll wheel um it limits our choice and squishy is hip
so i'd say
rather not go for for that let's see now um um solar
cells cannot be used on a curved or latex um surface or um remote control
but obviously that's not our problem um since we have decided or against
solar cells i assume right or is anybody still alright
alright uh which makes it very conventional but therefore traditional i assume um
um
with the titanium um we cannot make it a curved design we would just be able to make it flat and
and um yeah a straight design pretty much which i assume would exclude uh some of the more sophisticated versions

you can have an l c d  screen um but therefore no rubber will be used
alright so plastic yes titanium yes but this will of course influence the form with plastic
as i understand it you can use any form um latex
is tricky or rubber and um
and titanium also seems to be tricky when it comes to the form so the way to go is if you want a scroll wheel you either make it flat and angular uh add an l c d  screen and um
then you can basically choose either plastic or titanium or wood even um if you wanna make it a particular shape use plastic
add an l c d  screen add a scroll wheel that'll be fine or make it just push buttons basically plastic gives you the b biggest variety of of options maybe not the nicest feel or not much originality really
with rubber we could uh sh pretty much shape it the way we wanted it but we cannot add scroll wheels and we cannot add an l c d  screen
that's the tricky thing
s certainly can be done yes um yeah if that
doesn't affect the functional side of it all like say just the underside or so then it can be done
i assume yeah
so
the fruit design um
how about um affecting the surface of the actual um remote control
say we don't make it p a particular fruit shape obviously but uh give it like the surface of
an orange banana whatever you name it
just design wise
mm nice one
mm
well we we're supposed to stick to the company colours though that's yellow and grey so what have we lemon banana is
grapefruit is what we'd go for when it comes to the outer appearance perhaps
but mm
well we have it banana shaped already kind of so
right
i it's yellow
well so why not add a couple of grey stripes and make it look like a banana
there you go

it could be an ape

yeah
that's pretty much it i informed you about the materials what the interior has to look like and what the limitations to certain materials are on there you go
sure hang on there you go
well we can still design a two piece uh remote um without having a base having one
of them be a base station but just have it be an optional either big remote with lots
of functions or you take out the smaller piece we can still do that
however of course this would be like designing two remotes pretty much so um
which then as i understand it would probably limit the limit again the the the
use of certain materials because they would be too expensive say like have a scroll wheel and uh on both
of them or have an l c d  screen and so on so on you'd probably have to stick rather with a just traditional rubber button
design which we saw there
but could be done of course
right
okay when it comes to the chip on print as i said the the more advanced features you want um the fancier the chip has to be and the more expensive uh if you want just a normal button version the chip on print is gonna be
a cheap one right
yeah
as long as the pla uh the rubber is nowhere near the controls yes
m more of a l lamination perhaps
yes it does
right
right


yep
oh it was sort of banana shaped
those like yeah sort of spongy ones

what's it called cust you personalised yeah
yeah
okay
why can't i see the crazy um yeah i talking about the interface
concept and how the customer relates to will use the consumer will use the actual device um
so i've looked at some of the stuff i was sent um try and get some inspiration
but keep in mind that our own ideas that we had
um i was sent some information from the company saying that they the technology department have devised a new speech recognition technology where you can program questions into such devices
they gave an example of a coffee machine where you program a question you program the answer
and the machine responds accordingly um okay
there's different ways of a user can use products l like a remote um
there's a graphical use where you you look at pictures and
well on a screen a command line where you obviously type things in and you get a response
um and then it ju that's just to point out the sort of inconsistent u sort of use of interface in remotes
you can't really see that picture well but there's various different remotes once again with lots of different buttons on making it more complicated
so then i had a look at new products that are on the market not necessarily remote controls but
ones that you'll recognise um this is the voice there is a voice recognition remote control
which can control mus multiple devices i have a there is a picture you surf your favourite channels uh with your
voice store up to eighty speech samples controls four devices t v  cable satellite v c r  d v d 
and audio
and you can record your own v verbal labels that are connected to remote control functions so the technology is there
um the one on the left is very similar to what we drew up on the board
in the previous meeting where there has scroll down functions on the side you can sort of just make those out
and then on the right is obviously an ipod which is you know possibly one
of the simplest things to use out there and really is and all that is is just a a nice big scroll menu that y
you sort of go through that is a
possibility and nothing's simpler really um then there's things like this which is a a
a kid's remote where the the parents have the facility to control
and program what children can watch before so the remote control it o only allows them to access the
channels that their parents want them to watch
and um it means that th children have a novelty of having their own remote control
so i don't know if there's a possibility of having one remote contr you know like we just had two components
maybe it can have more components you know different remotes
um the point made at the end there here is that you have to be sort of be need to be clear on your um
devices as to what you know things you use sometimes an arrow pointing down which may suggest
volume down could become confused just as a v  for volume just little things like that which would need to be made clear in
the design
um i think d carrying on from what i've already said a user friendly remote with minimum
buttons maybe we've so suggested this two part thing where if it was
to have a speech recognition thing you could maybe control that on the do it or program all that on the control bit
and then just have the simple sort of hand held thing that we sort of devised earlier as the actual remote um
i don't it could be a graphical display the actual remote contr the actual control port maybe could have
like an ipod where you just sort of control through the menus stuff like gets more and more compli complicated and then
the the hand held bit should be ergonomically designed and that is it
why am i
oh yeah
just
where are we uh
just to sort of show you
m they've even got things like that huge things which is just for your gr ninety year old grandma yeah
yeah yeah
and that yeah
yeah see
things
why's my screen crazy


mm
would you have to leave it by the window yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
would the sort of spongy and the the plasticky thing y you can get those mobile phones that initially have
a it is plastic but then they have sort of a a s a cover on it which is just sort of
soft and stuff so i don't know if that would still be possible to have you know in plastic but then where
do people hold it just all be sort of spongy


so you as the the possibility of having a a graphical display on it like a screen like the ipod
right
yeah
yeah
could we not you know have a shape with a scroll and the screen and then j just sort of that initial
shape we had just which is uh sort of banana esque so that's thing if we did
it yellow and um you know you just p stick on just sort of rubber things that that sort of grip the thumb bit they
wouldn't have any they're just on the exterior they wouldn't be necessary to the actual shape of the thing
yeah
mm

you could just sell it in different colours as well i suppose in different ye yellows i don't suppose we have to stick to co
stick to the colours yeah
mm grapefruit
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
and if it if it was done yellow which is a company colour
yeah
on the the gr the rubbery grips could be grey
yeah
it could and then you could actually h put the banana shaped thing on the fruit bowl on the coffee table and then people would always know where it was

yeah
yeah
well we sort of
rid of that because gonna use a battery and the base station might not be necessary
yeah
yeah
just just maybe yeah just a little bit of
yeah
yeah
yeah i think so i think



yep
okay
yep can i have your cable please thanks
okay so i was looking at trend watching
um unfortunately i wasn't given too much information i was given a brief executive
summary and then an update on some recent fashion trends that we might like to look at and
then i'll just tell you some personal preferences that i got from that
um okay the most important finding was that the fancy look and feel
seems to be twice as important to the users as the current functional look and feel design
which i think we've kind of already discussed before
um the second most important finding was that the remote should be technologically innovative
and again these are all things we've kind of already come up with on our own but this just backs it up and thirdly
the remote would be easy to use
as far as fashion update we've learned that fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme
for cloths shoes and furniture so that might be a bit of a challenge to incorporate this
into our remote but we can try
um and also as opposed to last year this year the material is expected to be spongy in feel
okay so from that um as we've already said we need to focus on a fancy look and feel
um i think we've already discovered that it's kind of hard to go away from the traditional
rectangular design but i think that even if it's very subtle we need to kind of trick our consumers so they
at least get the idea that they're getting something that's new and modern and sleek and
whether it's through the shape or the colours or all of that um for technologically innovative we've talked about the tracking device we brought up the idea of having two pieces which we could discuss further
and manuel had suggested um the energy source and the user interface discussing
some of those um that we could change a little bit we need to keep it simple have limited buttons
which i think the two piece idea might be really beneficial for
um we need to incorporate this fashion trend of fruits and vegetables
i don't know i mean i guess the two options are if we had our remote in the shape of a fruit or vegetable yeah
yeah right or with exterior designs but my question is
i mean the stereotypically speaking you kind of picture males with their remote controls and
i'm not sure how they'd feel about having fruity logos on the outside so maybe we could have something
that's somewhat removable or i don't know different options for female male target groups
and then the spongy feel i guess we could look at mobile phones and
other technology that's out there c and look at different types of material that might please our
users who want spongy feeling remote controls
so that's that

that's what i was thinking yeah

yeah so when you buy your remote you can buy
various coverings
personalise your remote

mm hmm


dunno


spongy





y probably not yeah

mm
no hmm
mm like a covering yeah
the we can have the fruits and vegetables on the spongy parts so they can remove it
mm
mm

bright citrus colours yeah
oh yeah yellow and grey


i think having a shape could be a little ridiculous like
well we kinda do yeah
and if it's yellow
grey buttons yeah

mm

oh
nice could look like a fruit bowl


'kay
so is the two piece idea out or have we not decided
oh right okay

mm
mm
mm
mm
well what about what you said like putting the
finger grips just on top of the plastic
yeah
so then for the scroll are we going for the ipod type
yeah okay

okay
everybody ready
welcome at the functional design meeting again presented by maarten
uh this is the agenda the opening uh we've got three presentations and i'm gonna show
you some of the new projects requirements that were sent to me and we're gonna make a decision on the
remote control functions we have uh forty minutes
oh well this is the the closing already so uh well we start off with the th the first presentation then
uh i think um in uh we have to do it in uh in right order maybe the
well it
oh that it won't doesn't maybe we should start with the the technical functions
yeah
well it's you dumped the file in the uh in the sh in the project document folder you've already done that
well let's close this one we'll just uh open a new one
uh well yes
uh oh new thing
oh yeah uh i have to say something uh due to some uh technical problems i haven't uh digitized the last uh the meeting minutes but i'll uh make sure that uh happens next time
and i'll get this one uh in digital uh form too
okay
okay
okay but it's the technical side of the remote control
oh
okay well we'll we'll have to skip that part then
but you don't think it's a problem um to design uh the technical part of the remote control it's gonna be easy
okay
yeah m
okay
r regardless of what type of functions we want to implement doesn't really matter
okay yeah okay
okay
well we'll see we'll see later on
no
well uh will there be some uh user requirements later on the ones i i've uh received from the account manager yeah
well we'll keep this in mind and then discuss it later on
uh huh
okay but this real this uh big d uh distinction between this type of remote we should we should choose one uh we should not compromise but uh really choose for uh expert viewer or novice v yeah well what that's what you want trying to say
okay
okay
yeah well some of these uh yeah
well some of that will yeah but i but it will be more clear when we come to the uh u uh some of the new requirements
so
mm hmm

okay
well then the marketing expert can uh tell us something about the current market
okay
visually presents
okay well then we i'm gonna show you some of the new project requirements and then we gonna discuss on
uh what features we find important uh
well some of the uh new requirements make some of your findings quite uh irrelevant
i think
because um
uh s decided to put they have decide to put two additional requirements forward
well now i see four that's kinda strange
well they say tele teletext becomes outdated since the popularity of the internet well i think that
may be so but well we can't just leave the teletext button off it's impossible i think
so the compromise we could make is just to make one teletext button you know like on and off
and don't make a lot of special put a lot of special features on it to make it transparent or
you know it's just you want you want to be able to make use of teletext but not to play with it that
much so we have to think of that the remote control should only be used for television otherwise the project becomes more complex
which endangers the time t t ma uh the time to market so maybe we should leave
all d v d  and v c r  related features off completely
i don't know i think that uh
that's what they're trying to say uh our current customers are within the age group of forty plus new products
should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty so you uh talked about the elderly who were willing to spend
more on a remote control and who were interested but well they're not relevant because we are
aiming at a younger
yeah but it is it's is a dif it's a fact that the th th that bigger market you're talking about we already cover
that our company already sells remote control to the older people but we we also want
you know a new customer group that's the one we haven't covered yet so i think that's
what the problem is we haven't got remote controls for uh well i think yeah
yeah i think so maybe if it's no no but i think we have to just keep in mind what the older age group wants so maybe we can
make a remote control that's primarily interesting for the younger group but isn't that bad for an older person either
uh our corporate image sh should stay recognisable in our products our product's corporate colour and slogan must be implemented
in the new design okay something else nice to know
sorry yeah you will have to look that up

i think it's something about the oh okay i thought it w might be let's make things better or something but
okay well let's go back to the
the agenda
so we've now had to the three presentations we know about the new project requirements
that means we can uh well d yeah discuss on the remote control functions well if i
can uh make a start i think it's becoming more clear what kind of remote control it's gonna be and i already talked about
the maybe you have a f familiar with the rem remote control that has the the can opener underneath it i think we're we're
looking for some yeah we we're looking for a really simple remote control with only basic t v 
functions y well that
yeah
yeah
yeah yeah m yeah that's why um well a lot of um the use the requirements
the the account manager sent me i think they are are c are contradicting each other because they want a simpler design
and no uh other uh s functions than just t v  but they s do aim at a younger well ma
but i think uh you we can make some discuss uh distinctions in uh what kin in the know th th in functions you have
y
well you have different kind of uh equipment in your room like a t t v  and a d v d  player you can uh know you you
can make very d you can put very detailed functions regarding the t v  set on
your remote control uh with the with uh the you know audio settings and uh v uh screen settings we
don't want that i think that was that became clear we don't want but w maybe we should put some func
uh i know that the younger people will most likely have a d v d  player they want to
you know they want to uh
control remotely
no yeah th th the user requirements of the the the new project requirements told us not to but maybe w yeah i think we maybe should
yeah well we should uh put some functions for other maybe for other equipment on it but just the basic functions maybe like rewind and wind or n what d what do you guys think
yeah if as far as possible
but what do you think do th should we implement features that uh uh or functions that to control other devices no you don't think so yeah the new requirements say so
well maybe it's maybe there there there is something th m most of the time these functions don't support the particular device as well as their their own remote control you know a lot of d v d  players have some tricky settings with
yep exactly
that's that's wha
no no you don't no no you don't need it no no
okay but we have to think uh w we have to think d v d  i th uh i guess so um but uh from my
experience it's kinda a lot of d v d  players you know like forwarding goes differently uh you get two speed or
eight speed or sixteen speed it's c sometimes a bit difficult maybe if we just leave the d v d 
functional m uh well i was thinking about putting it in but concerning the project requirements
and what you just said i think we m should focus on the t v  then
and uh and it's just an uh a complimentary remote and not a universal one if you want to keep it simple you can
make a universal remote okay it's just a s it it should be something that is like a gadget on your
coffee table and it's just for when you you you jump on the couch you pick up the the the nice remote the simple one just
to put on the television nothing more
okay
um but what televis
yeah we we'll make w this one trendy and simple well we we will come to that but ju first on the
on the functions so we should put uh zap buttons on it um also
numbers to uh to go to the specific channels
uh
okay a t a teletext button should be there but just one big teletext button on and off
probably
oh okay
yeah but uh i think that becomes too difficult it's not a very common function and people will have to read up on their remote then
yeah yeah but maybe you s yeah yeah maybe y you do but i've never heard of it in the first place and
we have to well t yeah and t and teletext is becoming outdated we just want to see
what programmes are on and what time it is probably yeah i don't know i think that that's kin getting
too complex for our remote i don't know what you th guys think
yeah but do you like to have a such a s stop button or do you think it uh
i think it's a kind of uh uh very rare and special function
yeah
okay it goes yeah but that's kind of stuff we should do on the internet right now that's why it was uh said in the in the use in the r new requirements
well yeah uh lots of new televisions can store pages you know and then you can just skip manually through them using i think we should just put one teletext button on it then we meet uh the new requirements
we also meet the other thin y you sh you just re we have to choose for the the simple design i guess
okay um well what functions do we have to decide on
or do we uh i dunno if we have t stif specifically name all the functions we n we want
we have the zap and uh the volume should we do m make them very big the the the zap button d d
th that's that's that's considered to be trendy also
or maybe you should place them on a uh in a special way
yeah something or uh somethin special way to to zap through the it has to s it has to be yeah and quick you have to use it very quickly
yeah and it the buttons should make it um possible to to zap through your channels in a rapid at a rapid pace
oh what should we decide on then
i think in a in a case of this simple remote control the technical aspects which uh weren't worked out already but it w shouldn't be a problem then
yep
no okay but we don't have to uh when we don't want to uh control other devices i think it makes it even more simple
i think
i think that we should use uh d yeah not not uh the b the watch kind th the most uh well it has to be simple and i wi
which are most likely to be found somewhere in the house you know
oh how much time do we ha we have left uh m m m more than thirty minutes uh ten twenty minutes well uh these these shouldn't
yeah yeah okay but that's that's
do you uh have you have you think about tha thought about that how we can what the extra touch can be do you suggest design
or the shape or some gadget f f kind of feature or well it was something about how we
lose them maybe it should be a remote control when you you clap you hands it makes some noise or some
gadget kind of thing
yeah
i don't know i don't know nah um a lot of people like to have such kind kind of kind of gay kind of things
it w it w should be like a birthday present or something that you give someone and it is i has something nice
or maybe it w should have a big uh light that can flash or something on it or maybe it should
or an or the like the the can opener maybe it contains some feature that you don't normally
link to a remote control i think it's very impor because we're gonna make such a basic remote control we have to do
something to make it special it's gonna cost twenty five euros
yeah but the well it's already been done
nah yeah that's true but and i think it's gonna be uh very uh it has to be sturdy or something
so maybe with with bouncing pads so that you can just throw it on the floor or something it has to be used
something special and you really it has to you know y not s people when they buy
it they have to think well this one lasts for a long time we're really gonna use them not some thing you you throw away next week
you know
so maybe uh that's i i think that's when uh when we decide on these type of functions know basic functions uh it's
very important to find something like this so there's a very important task for you and maybe we can all think
about it uh also for you maybe when t you it's very nice when you can be entra when you can be trendy and and
uh and al as in a friend use friendly as well you know so big buttons flashy design
and maybe some kind of gadget kind of thing
uh huh
yeah or just different colours would be uh i don't know if people also wanna spend more money on fronts for their uh remote control it could be be yeah you never know but
but it and i think we have to make it quite big
yeah people
so and and also because uh it is expensive if you want it to be something you know it's ha doesn't have much functions want to be you don't want to get it l make it
mm hmm
and shou and should ni look nice when you put it on a table i i think you m might wanna put it uh yeah that it
it it it stands up yeah you have to put it on its so it's like a vase or uh something you put on a table
no no put stuff inside it but it's like like a statue or something
yeah yeah but yeah but you also can put it somewhere near the window in
that it's it's fashionable
i i don't
oh yeah
yeah but but when you when it gets lost how can you press the button to make it

oh okay
uh that's kind of nice
and then also you don't even need batteries because you can make it uh chargeable
yeah that w yeah but yeah the pro no well i think that it might be t p well nee but we don't yeah
maybe you but we don't know much about production cost but when you you can imagine that when you spend twenty five euros on a remote
control and it's a basic remote control then the then the money there must be money to spend on that kind of
st you know rechargeable units
yeah but we would d ma we'd do it in taiwan and so it's not gonna be that expen
uh i i think it's a great idea
s some kind of be i've never seen that before and you make it uh um be uh you see it with uh the mo the mouses nowadays
well i well it's really ch you can recharge it so you ha never have the battery problem that's one and uh you can always find your remote control up
uh okay well maybe yeah you could when that's when it's too costly you could probably skip the recharger but you will you do need uh also an uh also you would need a battery in the the base unit as well you know does it makes it kinda
yeah yeah okay yeah
yeah but then it's very easy to make it also a rechargeab i don't think that is gonna cost much to make it also a recharge function in it
yeah
i think it's a good idea and make it you know we we um
well we uh it's it isn't a t a most uh costly uh remote control we can save on the on the functions we just
put some simple button in make it big and sturdy nothing more and just make s sure there's some noise
that it can make or probably some kind of cheap light thing around it or that it uh that it lights up
it's also nice and if you put it away i think it's uh w we have to we uh that's uh
it's not a easy market we have to something special and for twenty five euros people want something remote c special
from your mote control and we can't deliver that in r with uh regards to the functions because we aren't gonna put
yeah and then uh when make it you know nice looking shape and this and then you also you got the stand up thing
yeah i think i think it's a good idea
yeah oh if it let's well we will see what's possible concerning the the costs and if
it's possible we'll do that and we even try to save up on other stuff to make sure we can do such a thing and
the first thing we the most likeable thing to to n to skip is then probably the recharge function or
something if that's too expensive we won't do that but it would be nice
it's the idea i know that batteries last long nowadays and and what people just think about well i'll never have to buy
any r batteries again so y b because it's very annoying when your battery is empty and you know then when you haven't batteries
around and probably for two weeks your remo i've experienced that that
yeah okay
so easy functions well we will we will i think we'll work that out zapping numbers on it bi
yeah but it's also annoying 'cause as long as it stays as it ke
keeps working you're not very motivated to do something about it then it beeps all the time and you
don't want to have ever have those problems and you won't have if if you have the rechargeable and you don't have to use the unit
you can also put it on the side if people don't like it uh i i in the in the ma yeah but
it w i mean if if they pay for it because they think oh that's a great idea i'm gonna use it and when it you know when time
goes by and they think well i'll never put him in the recharger i think last long enough then they put it on side and they can use it now
and then then when they look get m i i i know for sure that everybody who buys this remote control within a couple of months
of they will be in the situation that they they're seeking for the remote control they wanna see something quick and uh just push the button and th uh i
think it's brilliant yeah i've never it's so simple but i've never seen it
m maybe we should really do this okay
now well how much time have we got left these clocks aren't uh synched oh now i've put uh well
it is twenty p okay so we have ten minutes or something
yeah but we're uh we're done i think
we've decided on the functions well there is some oh
there is a closing sheet
we have lunch break and then we have thirty minutes of individual work
oh okay i'll make sure i'll i had some problems with uh the digitising the the first minutes the
the s the next minutes won't be a problem but i'll try to make sure the first one will be in the folder too but maybe it won't work
but you'll see i think these are more important than the first ones so
oh five minutes yeah because uh i i d i did uh the first minutes i did were were were a bit scratchy
you know then i did a s second one with a nicer layout which i could uh know use for the other
ones well but uh i d think uh i forgot to do put done under the first one and when you go write a second uh
it's get it's not working when you try to write second uh paper or something and then you
you had to overwrite it or someth i don't know becau i d uh it was not my uh pen
this kind of looks you like
of the shape
yeah probably it would be nice
no bigger
well i i i have to say i have this uh can opening remote control in my head most of all
or i think some maybe we should no that will be too costly we shou we could also that was a would also be an idea
but i don't think it i don't know if it exists already you should like make alessi or something design it
that would also be nice
but that's gonna then you c then you don't
yeah but then you don't have t yeah it that's not something i that's in the production cost a one it's a one time you know
s was it's a single cost yeah m but but then you can nah i don't thin i think that it would be more expensive
because i've bought the alessi stuff more often and even small pencil holders
or something are more expensive
would be a nice idea though
i don't know i think it uh has to be a r it has to have round forms or something
like something like that or so or so
and on th and then uh s a base unit underneath it it's also round
put it in there uh wire on it
maybe uh i don't know some some lights a big but well

volume and programme yeah
and some of the extra funct
some of the extra functions over here numbers
and and lights how we're g well maybe uh s a ring of no no you have to maybe on the side of it
along the side uh strip of yeah
yeah but i also meant the the blinking li w you know the ones that also blink when you try to uh uh locate your remote
well theys have to be
yeah yeah yeah exactly when you you see it from the side then it would look just like that
and then you have
a strip of uh lights or something
well uh i think it's nice for one thing maybe put something on top of it or you know like that's looks funny i don't know
or some bump maybe some yeah
we'll have to think about it i think we're we're done
we can save this one
mm mm
yeah that was what uh
mm we'll hear about it
here we go again
oh
okay

mm okay
yeah it's okay


okay
no
in project
no can that open
open it there
okay
about the get

okay
but nothing restricted for user interface
with technical
i don't know
'kay
okay
but i kind of uh
yes
uh
well the technical functions um well i don't know if you got the same uh
pictures as i got but uh i got these two and i think they're we have
to focus uh on uh the uh one hand the expert view
or the novice user
th i think it's it's very much uh depending on the user requirements i don't s uh know who's doing t
yeah but it i think that's very important to watch uh what kind of functions there we want to uh put in a remote control
yeah well y we can put functions in it when uh yeah when we uh get the user requirements uh and we can update it
well yeah w if you want try a a a huge market if you want to reach a huge market
uh like elderly people and we have to choose for novice user but
i don't know it's it's really um depending on how how how far the the the remote controls
are already in n um in use
yeah probably yeah
uh well there are l at least uh basic functions uh like just th the channels
uh one till nine uh on and off switch which must be clear with a red button or something like that
um most standard uh have volume of course and a mute function and
of course the next and previous channel i think that's just basic what we need and
from that on we can user requirements what we need more
uh
yeah i just um um i thought joost was looking at the trendy
the trends in the markets and i don't know if there uh are any um uh if you put
more functions more buttons maybe it's com becoming less trendy or something like that
m you can just you can k you can keep it in mind that i don't know uh i th i thought
the the with less buttons you can make a more trendier uh
yeah more trendier design i think i think
yeah
uh well that's all i have to say i think
yeah that was it
okay
well
no way
yeah
but what's our slogan
the slogan uh

puts fashion in electronics
sense simplicity
yeah
yeah but wha
but
yeah but you sai you said that that a lot of functions aren't used so why should j we put this function in i think more i think uh people younger people are more looking for just a trendy look than uh more functions
yeah but uh you said yeah d yeah but th the functions are not in the remote control we're making
it's n
yeah
yeah
no
no new requirements say no
so
yeah but
i i if it's too simple uh th they won't use the remote control they use their own th th with lot more functions
no no exactly
mm yeah
yeah but just
keep it simple and look more at th
no
it's only for television so
yeah
yeah nothing more exactly
yeah the user interface is easy
and the basic yeah basic functions yeah
it's too much integrated in the other
yeah
will you look

look at the market
well
yeah i uh it's sunday i always use it for the uh yeah for the soccer uh
well uh when you uh uh when you look uh for example um a couple of weeks ago i looked at the for the flights and there are a lot of flights in one page so if if th
yeah but
true
a simple yeah
but trendy yeah i don't know
original it was uh
true
yeah
maybe uh
uh maybe we uh uh the batteries maybe if you use large batteries or small batter batteries
yeah
yeah
okay
early break
to find him that's maybe yeah

yeah
yeah
yeah but that's yeah
yeah
be original yeah
mm hmm and use friendly yeah
yeah

must brain storm
well
why not
more money for us
yeah
quite big yeah you think
a standard or something

it's like you have uh four phones something like that

on the television
oh like this

a char chargeable yeah
why not

production

it should be possible i think it's a good idea
to make a base or something
it's it's it's it's
it's not the purpose to be handy it's
mm yeah but that's not it's ugly i think
no
yeah
true
yeah
yeah it must be must be a gadget to have
yeah
yeah we c
or just give a beep when the battery's out or uh down

yeah
true
yeah
yeah
and you can leave it just there
yeah
yes
yeah i'll
uh fifteen minutes

can you make an uh uh
a part of f folder for the minutes maybe that not not everything in one one uh folder
yeah
maybe
or the sh

do you get an idea of the shape
a little bit bigger yeah but

oh uh look uh look at the pictures
yeah flash lights at the side at the side or something like that
yeah
yeah
yeah side of it just two leds or something on the side yeah
yeah
well uh probably at the side
you know look at the front but
yeah exactly and then there is yeah
yeah something like that yeah
no no
bumper or something
yeah
lunch break
okay then

okay five uh
oh


my mouse is not working anymore he's uh when i put it in is is going to beep beep beep

huh
okay how can i get this on the whiteboard
okay i've done that
yes
'kay we're going to um
uh talk about working design um the method of the remote control is uh electrical energy it activates a chip uh in the remote it's an electrical circuit
which compose uh messages in the form of uh uh infrared signals to control the television
mm it's a nowadays very uh known a known uh uh technology
um the known technology can make a cost very low uh it's a wild uh
a wide sale uh of uh remote controls in the world and and the components are very uh
very cheap um
uh diodes uh bat batteries and uh uh led lights they're needed and they're uh
everywhere available uh again it's a fair price it's a common uh technology uh
like i told um uh the circuit board it's the most um important uh
um part of the remote control uh we can use for that uh fibreglass with copper wires it's it is uh
can be made as fast as printing paper it's uh it's all very uh
yeah they're making it uh all the time uh
and it's not uh very specialised uh technology
i haven't come to here but
um i've got uh some uh images of uh remote controls they were not uh very uh trendy or just uh
just a remote control like everyone knows so i don't know uh why i should put it here
uh
yes but uh i uh haven't made it because uh of the time but
what
no
yes
um no it's uh it's just a part of uh a known technology yeah
remote control is nothing special nowadays
um
i don't think so because of the all the televisions uh there are a few
maybe a couple of televisions with the new functions but is it useful to put them on
a on a standard uh remote
no

but you can put them under the same button
but you can put a play and stop and and rewind
yes but we
huh
yes but there are there are
but how wi how will you be able to handle a whole market there are uh a dozen of uh dozens of of remote controls that have


yes but you could put
on the z on the zap buttons you can put it to uh to uh access all the same pages if you have seven pages you can go up and down
yes
yes
maybe we can make uh a kind of a joystick
but
no it's o just signals uh and the television d uh does the rest
no
the most standard batteries
but i in a way we have to be uh uh special
maybe th m

for the remote control
that's to be uh a formed for your hand
more like a joystick then
but that's that's fun for the first time and then the second
or you can
yeah
with recharger
yes but is that handy
but but remote controls remote controls nowadays can can last uh two years three years with with t two batteries
and then you
yes or
but you pay for it
maybe like this pen
it has to feel nice in your hand

oh
oh i got a nice little screen here over here
i got like this big black border uh on every side
i'll i'll fix it yeah whatever

yes
i don't know what the right order is so
mm hmm
yes i agree yeah
yes
yes
i haven't really found a conclusion like that
yeah
design
sounds interesting

alright
yes
yeah it's alright um
alright i've done some research for functional requirements um yes
the working method um there were hundred uh uh w h one hundred people uh
how do you say uh f watched using remote controls in the usability lab and
they also uh filled out a questionnaire uh with a few questions uh i've lined them up here
uh ask whether um common remote control looks good or not about willingness
to spend money on remote control about zapping behaviour and uh and stuff like that
i uh have found some interesting things we do we do got a market um
three out of four people claim m uh to find remote controls ugly
so if we make a trendy design we sure have seventy fi seventy five percent of the market which you can
reach
um three out of four users uh zaps a lot as i uh
quoted here from the uh results zap buttons are used one hundred and sixty eight
times per hour that's quite a lot um
relevant options are of course power buttons although only used once per hour
uh channel selection volume and buttons for text and
the more um yeah other functions like audio settings video settings sound settings
are not said to be very important and uh very much used furthermore fifty
percent says
uh they only use ten percent of the buttons on a remote control that doesn't say we got we can leave ninety percent off but
it sure um says we shouldn't make it too uh complicated
fifty percent also claims uh to have lost a remote control very often in the room
and um an important thing here the most important customers uh
which is over seventy percent of our market is in the age range of thirty six to sixty five years
old and uh elderly people our market are less interested in
uh nice features but more willingly to spend more money on remote controls
so what i was thinking oh wrong side we shouldn't
implement too much features on uh on our remote control because elderly people will get th lost
group features for a higher usability uh what i was claiming in the previous meeting
um all the settings about audio settings video settings and channel settings
which are not very often used
we could group them uh on one button
and make them accessible uh in one menu button or whatever because they are used
very rarely and well it uh there are a lot of options there so we can
really make uh yeah how do you say
we can spare at buttons over there and um if you want to implement v c r  and d v d  options group them in the button not too uh
yeah
small buttons so they won't be very um how do you say
yes won't be very present thank you and a trendy look well uh although seventy percent
of the market is uh consists of elderly people uh who don't really care for trendy looks
or whatever i guess it can do no harm to make it trendy for the other thirty percent
that was kind of what i found
okay
yes

two
no uh i agree i agree
not too much no
yeah
okay

mm hmm

i don't really agree actually to be honest it's a very small market which we will approach then if we uh want to reach customers younger than forty it's only like thirty percent of the total market mayb yeah
okay
maybe maybe we can compromise a little bit not too much then bu alright
yes
yeah i'll have a look
we put the fashion in electronics
sense and simplicity

well to be honest if um our uh aim group is uh
till forty not older than forty maybe that's not very uh yeah we don't really need
to have a simple remote control i think we can implement more functions then because um
basically uh the younger people are more able to adapt to new technology and therefore
will be a more
yes
yeah
well i think
yes
yeah control


not much more than that
yep
or we can u u we could put 'em behind the flip flap or whatever
so t

yeah
y yes
but but for for example v c r  that's better example in this case i think on a remote control for
television you don't need to be able to programme uh the v c r  to start recording
at three p m  or whatever just play stop rewind and uh fast forward
yeah i know but uh
yes
yeah
alright
yes definitely yeah
yeah and maybe two or three other options but not nothing more than that i think stop function is very useful if you have a uh a page which consists of more pages and you are not a very quick reader
then i think it's very irritating if the next page shows up but
well i use it very regularly the action i re i use it quite often

might be might be
i think the plus and the minus button should be uh quite present yep
yep
if you grab the remote your hands should be on top of the plus
yes
i think double a 
yep
the most ordinary uh batteries
yep
i think about twenty minutes
i think that's n that's more for a for an age range or uh ten to twelve or whatever
yeah yeah that's good one yep
ye i think the can opener i is a brilliant idea actually because television and beer is not a rare combination
yes
yep
no that's true
yeah
yeah a swapable front or whatever
yeah

yes definitely definitely

yes it it it should be f be visible nearly anywhere in the room as i uh as i said during my presentation fifty percent uh o
yeah
a face or uh yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah i see what you mean yep
if you do that but i don't know if that's possible within the production cost of twelve and a half euros
i in in the base we could like make uh a button and if you push it the remote control
itself s makes noise that's probably stupid but uh as i found here uh
fifty percent was it fifty uh fifty percent
fifty percent often loses remote control
no uh of the base the the the the the the the thing you put it in
if an a button in in that uh
yeah you can ma make rechargeable one yeah why not
it should only cost twelve and a half euros of course aye
yeah okay
yeah
yes yes definitely yeah
well y you you could connect that to two hundred to twenty volts of course i don't know
on the other hand if you don't do it we can also make a nice bay i mean it looks trendy and still still put a bleep function in it but um i think the bay is definitely uh
sure why not yep
yeah
yeah
definitely
with eye candy ear candy whatever yeah definitely
yeah
definitely yeah
it would be nice yes
most televisions break down before the battery pack is empty so yes
yeah why not
hmm
no that's true
why not
bleep bleep bleep oh there it is yeah yeah
no nearly
yeah

something like that yeah
oh
we'll see
maarten five minutes
no that's true uh yeah
should we by the way draw um
on our nice whiteboard um a little uh idea of yeah
i dunno has anyone got um a little bit detailed ideas about the shape i don't for one
a bit bigger i guess but
the shape is nice it's um
something different and we want we want that yeah
okay yeah
yeah but twelve and a half euros uh
yeah
yeah that's true
something like that is very ergonomic
so
yeah
yes volume and programme should be there i guess because you hands wi uh y your hands will be in the smaller part
yeah and the numbers on top i guess
maybe ro roun rounds uh uh l sorry
maybe lights also around the volume and the p the plus minus programme buttons
oh
okay
yeah
okay yeah

i think i think that'll be too big tha too big then
yeah
yes we are
alright yes i guess it's lunch time
i don't know
half and hour i thought our next uh next individual round was half an hour
i don't know about the lunch break
well
'kay hello everybody uh i guess you all know what is it about you all received the email i guess
uh we are actually doing this meeting to start a new project which is about designing a remote control
so i'm going to be the project manager of this uh project
and uh so i'm present myself i'm fabien cardinaux and uh i i guess you can present yourself
so i dunno you can starts
okay
and you are in the project

so uh so today we are doing a short meeting to present the project so um
we are gooding we are going to present the tool we are we are going to use during all this project we
are talking about the project plan and we are going to to discuss about st our first ideas
and so on and yeah so we have around twenty five minutes to do this
meeting
um so what is the goal of this project is to design a new remote control
so it should be of course new and original and um it should be trendy
and user friendly that mean it's a very challenging project and uh
uh so w it's we will try to do our best and hopefully come with something very new and that
people want to buy
so um
so what's uh what are we going to do during this all this project so it's
more like we are going to do inv individual work all in o in o our
specialities and we are going to meet each other quite often to discuss and
to find a good way
um
yeah and everything is will be like this
um so now we are going to to get used t to
to the tools we are going to use all during all this project so we can try to use
uh the whiteboard here so uh
for example we can try to write what is our our favourite animal and
write the f our favourite characteristics about it
mm
uh so uh

so i will ask you all to do the same just to get used to the whiteboard
yeah yeah you can draw the picture of course

oh




never mind
yeah
no worry
you can draw it if you want


good

so good um so let's talk about money
uh we are going to to sell we want to sell uh this
remote control for twenty five euro euro and uh
our expected profit will be around fifty million euro
and uh we are trying to to have a market all around the world
so n not only for switzerland but for the world
uh
so um
the we expect a production cost of maximum
uh twelve point fifty euro
yeah of course
um so we can start today to have a first idea of what we want to do what
are our experiments with remote control and any idea so if you have
some experience good or bad with remote controls you can share it and say what
you f what is your idea anything
mm
yeah
yeah
okay
mm hmm
yeah
are you not afraid that if you take your remote control you can move the slide and it could the the volume can go up very quickly and it can
yeah also if y when you take the the remote control for example on the table you take it and you push the button and everything is very loud and
you have a heart attack
okay
yeah so you can do you have something
yeah that's true
yeah without obstacles and
okay let's continue i have a meeting in five minutes so maybe we should hurry
um so we will close uh this meeting
so we will have a next meeting in uh thirty minutes
um
uh the so i will ask you to do some work uh the
the interface interface developer will work on the on the design of the remote
control start to to have new idea and
read about yeah
oh
industry and oh
yeah
so um
for the user interface designer which is hamed um
uh you are going to work on the technical functions of the remote control
and for the marketing uh
manager i dunno okay which is bob uh
you are going to try to to find the user requirements f uh for the remote control
um you will receive by email uh the specific instructions and uh by your personal coach
yep finished
so i see you in thirty minutes

thank you
now what
okay so my name is petre you can call me petre or peter if you like i don't care
uh in the project i'm supposed to be the technic
bob okay
okay
okay
okay
so probably i would try to try to draw the animal well sh should i draw the picture of the animal i i th i think i should
okay so
um
okay american um um i would use the bird
so i tried to sketch it out
i had to first uh write it down because i am not absolutely sure if i can draw it but ah
can you recognise it as a bird
okay it's your turn to

oh it's okay

yeah
i should get used to the tool so oh just wait a little bit c could we put it here to make it as straight as possible ah probably not
okay it it works like this
are you left handed oh pity
ah it's maybe better if you leave it

you won't draw them or

just try i would like to see how it looks like

no i think it's clear
it's okay it's in it's indeed beautiful

okay
bob have to remember it
bob
per unit i guess y oh okay
okay
oh
okay i have also some points uh maybe two points uh first would be that in current remote
controls there is no back light so if you are if you are uh playing with this in the
dark room it's it's probably worth to to have something like uh
back light and maybe it could be also dependant on the
the amount of of light in the room so that if if it's in the day it doesn't need to be back lighted
because it works on the battery so so something like this
and the second thing f second point from me would be that in a normal remote control there is uh there are two buttons for volume control but i prefer like a potential meter or something like
you know some slider or not just two discrete buttons for volume but something which
yeah but i can reach in uh one second i can mute it down or or make a high volume
ah n
if it drops to the floor then it starts to scream
yeah f it depends what what you feel about that
yeah but we can we can think of these things afterwards but if you have some more notes on that
okay
um
okay just a second


which i which is hamed okay
uh i am the technical designer i dunno which one uh v
user interf okay
okay so i'm the first one
i see



sign
okay

uh


my name is hamed getabdar and uh i'm going to be interface designer in this project


i dunno if i should go with this
if it is enough line i'm sorry

okay


they should be remote
okay thanks

no
okay should i clean
okay i think like horses uh because they are strong and beautiful so if i want to write it here i think i can
oh

okay
i dunno if i can okay
it may be like a cow or i dunno whatever
i'm not good very good in drawing okay so this is very
it's a bird i think i dunno what is it
four
okay
mm hmm
mm
yeah i'm shameful yeah okay

mm hmm
uh i yeah just a simple experience i uh i prefer um
remote control working with radio waves because remote control working with infra red rays you
should you should you should keep it in a specific direction and then try it hard to tune
mm
yeah
uh huh
mm hmm
mm hmm
okay
okay thanks bye
uh my name's bob mor oh sorry
'kay so my name's bob morris i'm the marketing expert for this project bob yeah
yeah go ahead

okay okay
so i think my favourite animal would be a c a cat
that's its head um i probably like cats the most because they're cuddly and furry and uh playful
okay
thanks
maybe put it up put it a maybe put it on the desk or something


uh that's better
your lapel microphone's fallen off


yeah
yeah maybe we should just continue yeah don't worry about it
no


oh that's good it's good
yeah and strong


well from experience um i've had remote controls in the past that have had very they've had lots
and lots of buttons and they've been very small and it's been very hard to to to use because there's so
many buttons and you know it's very hard to see which buttons do what and the buttons are very small and
very hard to press um and and normally you only every use you know on a t v 
remote you only ever use mostly you know f four or f six buttons
um
so it's frustrated me in the past th that
ah okay okay
okay n
is that because the of the discrete volume levels or is that
yeah
yeah
okay
he's the industrial designer no you're the industrial designer
yeah i think that's the first i d  industrial designer and the second one is the user interface designer

and then last one's marketing which is me

great okay thanks guys bye
alright that did nothing okay welcome to the meeting everyone
just gonna attempt to make this into a slide show
sorry guys
i did twice
this'll just take a moment
or it won't
okay we'll have to deal with it like this then alright um this is the first meeting uh for developing our our new product i'm heather i'm your project manager
okay so um so that was the opening the first thing we'll do is get acquainted with one another if everyone could go around and explain their role and um and their name
nice to meet you poppy
alright

alright i'm heather and i've
i said i'm your project manager um
well you can pretty much read what it is that i'm doing but um um
yeah
and uh tool training
is one thing that we're going to be doing today um um as well as planning the project how we're going to
uh create this product and um discuss
um our aims and objects of this uh which brings us to our next subject is um
um as a team we're going to be designing and creating a new kind of remote control
um we want this to be a marketable product that can be trendy
um a completely new style so that um can really appeal to a
to a generation that doesn't want a simple plain kind of uh channel changer
and um it needs to be user friendly for um maybe for an example for people
that um can't see the numbers as well or um perhaps an ergonomic design
yes it's a television remote control
right i believe i should be taking minutes on this right now so alright
um yeah
um the way that we're going to go about this is um we'll have a time where we can um
come up with new ideas alone and and work on the project and then um after we've brainstormed
and and thought about we can come together in a meeting and and discuss what what um what kind of functional design
we want to use same with conceptual design and detailed design
so um
making sure that it it's usable that as a um
and that it's it's feasible to create and uh
to come up with a concept of it want what we want it to look like um tool training is is everyone um
okay great great um
one thing that uh we're going to do is become more acquainted with the the tools that we have access
to for our project um one of them is our whiteboard and um as a sort
of team building moment um i i'd like us to um
try out the whiteboard by expressing our favourite animal and the charac characteristics of that animal
um why that why that should be your favourite animal so um i
i'm assuming that we should do that now
'kay with our microphones still attached to our bodies okay
'kay what's my favourite animal
do come up
this is a team building time where um okay cool um
my favourite animal which changes all the time okay
right now it is an elk alright so
and it goes like
yeah it's got like big antlers yeah
looks kinda like like it has holly growing out of its head
yes yeah we have moose and we have deer
do you have
'kay um

thanks this is my
okay that's a sketching of my my elk and it it is my favourite animal right now 'cause
it is a large beautiful majestic creature that um that um
in a way it looks kind of awkward because it's on spindly legs and it uh but it can really overcome harsh terrain
and although it's gorgeous it's also very dangerous because it has um strong
antlers and uh
it can really combat its enemies even like it it's a it's an herbivore but uh it can really defend itself
yeah right
right i'm gonna take minutes while um you guys express your favourite animals
oh


great

i forget her name


it looks kinda like a person



it's kinda like a peacock

great
do you hear the eraser buzzing while you do that
yea
right
so now that we know how to use the whiteboard um the next
um thing we need to address is our financial department to meet
our our budget um or not meet our budget but more um like what kind of uh
selling range we'll be looking at um wanna make this um
selling price of twenty five euros and so we have to um come up with a way to
to create a a uh remote control where um
we can like the price to create it will be significantly less um we'd like to um
to uh make fifty million euro i'm assuming that's what the m  means um and make it for
an international market um one thing we'd have to think about internationally is in the design
of um like different kinds of uh v c r s things like that depending on which country you are
another thing for the design team to think about um we want it to cost uh absolute maximum
of twelve euro and fifty cents
i'm bad at math 'kay um so now that um that is underway um
it is discussion time so this is time for us to bring our initial ideas any um
suggestions that you may have so far a um your personal experiences with remote controls and um um areas you see that uh could be improved in your experience with them
does anyone have any initial thoughts
mm hmm so what's something we could uh do to remedy that


yeah it's a great idea it's a great idea

alright anything about um the look of the uh remote control that
you might have ideas about maybe it could be instead of like a standard rectangular shape it could
be um something more interesting like
any ideas will do that you have at this point
can hold it yeah
well if it's a trendy original um aspect we're going for i mean you're the designers you c you can um decide what kind of um direction you wanna go in but at this point in the in the first meeting it can be any ideas that we just throw out there
mm hmm
yeah
and the key issue here is is being trendy and original um that does not necessarily mean it needs to be outrageous
right okay we have five minutes left so just to cover
we have one more thing um like you can go over your ideas of course in your own personal times
um our next meeting will be in half an hour so you have half an hour to uh think about what you want to present
or not present but bring to the meeting um i d  whatever that stands for
industrial designer i have to remember these things um
you'll be beginning your your working design um u i d  the technical functions design
will will be worked on the next thirty minutes um maybe how this can be achieved and um
we need the user requirements from the manag marketing expert
um you will get specific instructions um of what to do in the next half an hour and i'll see
you in half an hour okay 'kay
okay okay
okay
hello
okay my name's poppy i'm the industrial designer for this project um i'm going to be responsible for the functional design phase also the conceptual design and the detailed design for the final product
okay


okay
so this is a television remote control yeah
okay
yeah got those notes

okay
okay

oh to go first oh are we all doing it individually
okay let's stand up and support you


okay

do you have elk where you come from
you do
okay
sheep yeah cows
that's a great elk yeah
brilliant
mm
very nice okay

okay i'll go next i am a big animal lover i like all sorts of animals but for the moment i'm gonna draw a cat in memory of my poor cat that died recently
it's gonna be a bit of a strange drawing but never mind

not as artistic as heather's drawing bit more cartoon style but i like cats because
they're so independent and they always seem to be doing what they want to be doing um but that doesn't mean they're completely
not sociable 'cause they enjoy interacting with humans as well and they seem to enjoy
the good things like sunshine and um running around outside as well as being inside
and enjoying their food and generally just they just seemed so cool and
they just know what they're doing uh i reckon they're sort of they got it sorted they know what they want
basically that's why i like cats
i'll rub that out
there you go
ooh

well there are loads of different types of dogs so i'm sure it'll represent one kind of dog


we can pretend
okay
yeah that's true



very nice
okay



okay
i always find that in our house the remote control always goes missing it's always where is the remote control so maybe if you could have some kind of
tracking device for the remote control or some signal that you could find out where it was i dunno some kind of alarm you can press a button on your wall signal 'cause it always gets lost
yeah yeah that you don't use half of them
yeah that's that's yeah it is yeah
yeah
mm
a novelty are we going into kind of novelty factors here like i've seen phones like a okay
yeah
mm hmm
yeah
i suppose if we're he heading to have it like make a huge profit out of this it needs to be quite
a universally accepted thing like a novelty thing might only sell a few things rather than like
a general kind of more acceptable but we don't wanna go towards boring 'cause that wouldn't
sell either so hmm
yeah
yeah
yeah
industrial designer that's me
mm hmm
okay thank you



my name's tara and i'm the user interface designer i will also be responsible for the functional
design phase the conceptual design phase and the detailed design phase of the user
interface design



gosh


yeah

an elk a vicious



we have sheep
that is really good i'm quite











very good
okay i think my favourite animal would be a dog but i'm not really sure how to draw one
i i've never drawn a dog i don't think i'm tempted to draw a snail 'cause i draw them
sometimes and they're really easy to draw um
right it's gonna be a really funny dog 'cause i'm not sure how to draw a dog

it's a cartoon dog i think a s i don't ev oh oh well it's a scary cartoon dog
that this that does not look like a dog i'm sorry
how do you draw a dog i suppose it has a lon oh my god right yous know what
it's supposed to be it's a dog
um i like dogs because um they're so good to humans like they can be
trained to be police dogs and seeing eye dogs and they're just such friendly animals
and like they're more of a companion than cats i've nothing against cats cats
don't really like me so i can't like them but they're just so friendly and warm and
nice animals that don't look like that



yeah

do yous not find that um
like there's a lot of um buttons on your remote control and you don't know what half of them do yeah i don't know what they do
yeah
yeah

yeah
yeah

you may have to do the function f  eight thing oh okay




hi i'm genevieve i'm the marketing expert i'm an expert at marketing um i'll be telling you guys
about the user requirement specifications for our new product um i'll be doing some trend watching in the conceptual design
and product evaluation for the design phase


yeah thank you





we have moose too

uh oh we have a good artist
oh very shapely
oh

tara
or tara
that's pinocchio


alrighty i feel like a robot okay um
well i guess i had the most time to think about it i'm going to draw a butterfly because i saw a butterfly yesterday that seemed to be like the symbol
of spring arriving and it was actually the prettiest butterfly i've ever seen out in the wild and i though that was pretty cool in scotland it was like
well it was a little pointier than that
at first i thought it was a dead leaf and then it landed on the wall next to me but this part was all brown and then it has these
big blue dots like this and then it kinda there was a green i think it was a green ring and there
was like red going out like this
yeah it kinda was actually 'cause it was this part of the body was really dull and then it was the most colourful exotic butterfly ever
and i'm like wow this is the middle of scotland in like march so i thought that was pretty cool and it landed by a wall and let me look at it for about two minutes
i wish i'd had my camera so that's gonna be my favourite animal because after all the snow it seemed to say that like spring is finally
here yeah there you go
uh what do we oh
yes i do

okay so we'll have a hundred percent profit then twelve fifty
okay
i find that in the dark it's often hard to know what button you're pushing

um
mm hmm
mm hmm
there's some remote controls where there's kind of a hidden panel so all those buttons that you don't really use unless you're programming or something that's useful so you just have like the number buttons power button t v  video button

could be shaped like a conch you know be like a shell shaped remote

interface oh industrial
marketing expert
okay welcome to the detailed design meeting
again i'm gonna take minutes oh we're gonna have a prototype presentation first uh who's gonna give the prototype presentation you two guys okay go ahead

oh no the the the mute button misses now do y do you did we want to have a m mute button
huh
wait there's was one thing i wanted to ask uh there are different ways for remote controls to uh do uh like
uh d i call it teens and twenties uh y th th th the two numbers
yeah but do we have do we need extra buttons for example some uh some have to
yeah but you don't you don't actually need them becau b l a lot of remote controls work that y when y that you when you fir you push the one first then you have a couple of seconds no i don't think so
nah i don't think so really because you have a i know some remote controls that don't have these buttons but you still can know obviously you can still select the twenty uh a number in the twenty or in the ten
no i think uh i really think it's n because you can when when you put a button on it with like one
and uh then a dash it's the same thing as when you just push the one because it i it first
gives you the functionality of that that uh separate button you also had to uh apply
yeah because that's i it's for television it's exact the same thing
no listen listen when you push the button the remote control gives a signal i in th in the first place it gives a signal
which it would also send when you put a separate button on it the one with dash that signal gi and when y whe when
you don't push another button on the remote control within five seconds then the remote control gives a signal for channel one
i think it works that way really

yeah but it's exact the same that w would appear when you put a separate button push a separate button
yeah but you don't underst uh you don't understand my point i think it's exact the same thing when y
no but then they would a would also support that button because it's the same thing listen with that that's
that special but button you're talking about eh that's just a signal to recei ju they send a t signal to the v tv t v 
that they have to put a one in on your screen and a dash which you can pu so you can uh still put
another number on it when you don't have that separate button and you push y one it's exactly the same thing do y you the remote
control gives that same signal as it would give when you only had
yeah
but you give the input you push the one that's the same thing as the button with the one and it yes it it is think about it
and it's the same thing what happens and a g remote control gives another signal after five seconds that is just one
yeah that's true yeah but i m uh but it's i i know for sure that some televisions that w th th the remote control
supplied only ha has the c these buttons with a one and a dash and a two and a dash but when you use a bu a n remote control
that doesn't sport these buttons it still works but okay we we'll impl
no we'll apply them then for now
yeah app just apply them next to the zero the one and the two yeah i think so yeah for now if we don't know for sure whether
yeah but okay what i said about uh the remote control sending another signal that that might
not be true but i still think i it it all t v s in some ways support it i don't know i think it's
more c is m maybe we don't uh we both don't really understand how it i how it really works but
i think there's more to in than wha than what you just said
i do think that uh m t v s support mur multiple kind of remote controls m
th won't work wi with uh to have that special button
okay well we'll see
but
well let's ha let's talk about the docking station later because uh maybe we have we have to uh consider the docking station anyway because we have some uh cost issues still to come but we have to look n i don't know
yeah
okay
yes that's it
i think added lights are gonna be a problem too
okay for now uh this is uh is good enough
yeah what was uh on the
okay but in the oh yeah the colour because we're gonna use uh one colour for the the plastic enclosure and
one colour for the rubber isn't it then we're gonna do the buttons in the i are we're gonna have rubber buttons and they're
be a they'll be in the same colour as the rubber on the side okay and i think we should use a a darker
colour for the um plastic and maybe some more m brighter and flashy stuff
yeah we'll talk about the lights later 'cause i also don yeah it's depends on the costs and such but uh
and we have to agree uh upon the exact colours but may i dunno if that's important but we'll talk about that later okay for
now this is this is okay um the next p y you gonna give a presentation too uh
i have to see the agenda
detail design
evaluation criteria
okay

okay
yeah i think four maybe would be appropriate because it's
yeah maybe it really depends on taste uh i mean it's kind of our design it's so if maybe a lot of people find it really ugly you know o other people find it really cool i don't know or uh i don't know how you
casting yeah
yeah but we d we didn't we're we're not planning to use fronts i believe with a colour a co a colours oh okay
okay but
oh maybe we should do three or something that w you know our
yeah
uh i was thinking about four so i think three is uh
yeah well let that let's make that a one
that's one thing for sure
yeah two or a one i guess it's something we really put work into
yeah
but
well maybe a two because of the menu button or something and telete
yeah we don't know if the uh they're necessary
i think a two
came a long way but not we didn't not uh
no w w it can also always be more simplistic but two is yeah
yeah uh a t i think a two yeah yeah y i it's hard to say from this picture
but i do think it's more
but i do think that it's more trendy than beautiful
so so i think maybe it has to score higher uh on this than on the
a th a three
i i uh when you compare to the
uh uh what's the difference with
okay
no
yeah but we uh you mean the rubber stuff yeah but we have t we have to talk about the lights uh and i don't u also it's also really not innovative it's more
no six or seven maybe yeah or six
yeah mine is seven
uh it's uh depends on the on the maybe
no i think i think actually it's a seven maybe but there's nothing innovative about it
n no no t
yeah i mean the dock station but but uh i think the the docking station it's gonna be a kind of a problem but
well let's leave it open for uh for us later to see what because we have to reevaluate anyway well i i yeah no
okay for now it's a six or a seven uh sev six maybe because
yeah but i don't i don't know if it's very inno yeah
yeah v
yeah more through uh like function t v  functionalities and no no you know what i
mean you have must be innovative technology for remote controls but more in how you control stuff not in how
you find your yeah yeah it's that's that's think about it la later on and uh
yeah as a a one or a two ma uh at least
yeah it's good
no i would have seen that one before oh you skipped one uh
uh here
remote control will be bought by
yeah definitely
well
uh just in general yeah a two
yeah but i think i think two
uh that is not the question it's just w it will be bought by people under forty
yeah you can yeah you can be very picky about it
ah yeah just make it we'll make it a two
oh no
yeah yeah you have make an slogan is quite obvious
oh the oh sorry no not not the slogan yeah you can put that on the side if if we would like to
yeah and i will i th still think it's gonna be a two or a three maybe a three this time
and uh
uh it's a one or a two
yeah make it a two
it's not that bad yeah and that's mostly the inno when we uh score higher on innovative technology we would score two
which is uh quite a great score okay uh this is was uh the evaluation
because i i still think that the most important part of this meeting still has
yeah
still opened or uh
yeah
okay finance because um
i received uh a spreadsheet
yeah but i uh actually don't need this presentation i guess oh
i'm gonna open the spreadsheet and we're gonna work this out together because i didn't really fin uh i have a
didn't really finish it
well we uh we'll see we'll stumble upon some problems
i probably have already opened it here
try it again first of all the mm all the docking station and costs and such are not included in this list
but let's let's st start with beginning we include one battery i i uh i'll explain its uh the the components
are listed over here uh price is given we um yeah we we uh indicate the amount of
components of the specif specific component how much we need of them and then uh we'll uh calcula don't
watch the number yet i don't know if it's filled in properly okay we need one battery one battery i think
one battery is enough we don't need kinetic solar cells hand dynamo a s okay this this is a
p first problem uh i think
we should know how many
simple chips regular chips
okay
but
where did we find this information was it
i think it was uh your job in the first uh meet uh f your first presentation to make this clear but then you had some t time problems but do you th you do you know what chip we need
maybe you can uh look it up right now
okay but okay when we don't when we leave the uh retriever and such aside what then it would be a simple chip and with the retriever it would be an advanced chip
okay yeah but it will it will it will be cause a lot of problems the sample sensor sample speaker what is it m is that the speaker we were t i don't know what it is
okay we went for the double curved case
made out of plastic
and rubber
and with a special colour
i guess that's what we were
yeah i don't know about the special colour but i think w uh
yeah i think we uh we have special colours
okay then the push button i was just counting them uh i think you have to indicate the amount of push buttons we want to use isn't it
well that's bit of a problem because i re but i really don't understand that because i can imagine a remote control with far more push buttons and it wouldn't be possible according to this uh sheet
yeah
ah
yeah it wouldn't
fill in the number of components you plan to use in the and the total cost i don't know
i
and i count them like this
one two three uh four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve and thirteen because oh this is oh this is one okay twelve okay then it would be eighteen because uh i uh rated them as uh um
as uh uh uh separate buttons yes and plus these two f uh plus the mute button and it's will be uh eighteen
yeah i don't understand y i do i don't get the point because it's would be
s relatively so expensive just these m small buttons
well okay well well let's make it just one
here now it's now it's already s shall we just
give our own interpretation to because else we would really have a problem it would be impossible to make it
and and less buttons than this isn't possible this is the most simple yeah it is possible but i've never seen one before


yeah without the numbers that's possible
yeah we could skip the numbers
then uh teletext would also be im impossible
okay we'll we'll just okay but then still when we there's no room for a docking
station or something tha w le let's see th we have uh oh yeah button supplements we'll give the buttons special colour we'll give them
a special form uh i think we should mark the special form thing because it this will be some special forms incorporated
in these big buttons i guess
because the buttons will be uh d will be matching colour between the buttons and the rubber surroundings i think that's the what they mean by a special colour i think all the special colour things have to be marked over here because that's what we were planning to do making it
yeah special material r also because i has rubber and the buttons have to be rubber
'kay but the problem now is that the
there's no such thing as a docking station in this list but we can all imagine that it would be impossible to make a docking station for thirty cents
separately
yeah yeah yeah but i do like the idea but we yeah it uh but it then the docking station isn't relevant for this project anymore but we can but then you still have to use we have to find out what chip we u need
i think we can agree on this i i think the special colour thing has to be uh marked
'cause i think we uh yeah i think that's what what what they uh mean
but can we find out uh about uh this chips because when we don't need a d a docking station then probably we also have only we also need a simple chip
and maybe then we can do something extra oh n uh oh still oh it's gonna get more expensive with two then we have some money left we can put then
we can put a scroll wheel on it or something
yeah well who knows or a little bit of tin titanium
yeah or we can ki do the kinetic cells that's also maybe an idea
yeah that's what then what he has to find out maybe you can uh find it in your email right now then we know then we exactly know what it will cost us maybe is that that's nice to know
yeah bu bu but when we yeah but when we skip when we um
when we don't use the do we're not gonna make the docking station then we still yeah we need something else maybe
to make it kind of special because that was our our special feature
yeah okay you can also do that but maybe
it still is a special remote control cons uh you know wi its form is special and material
yeah but for two euros then we have still maybe we have to use the advanced chip then two euros isn't even possible
yeah then because then we'd thirty cents left
yeah but yeah i don't know because maybe d uh yeah we have to find out with the simple chip
yeah and w and and we uh need f and what is this sample sensor sample speaker
you can look at it for s presentation
s technical functions
oh
oh oh oh
hey
oh
mm
i don't think here it's in here already
it's nothing about s yeah
no
but i in the presentation of yours there was also something about different components which one was it
functional requirements
ah
ah yes it was the second one
yeah it was your second your first presentation
sorry
uh this is n this is not this n that's not the right one i don't oh
no this is the other one or maybe something is uh maybe there's something abo in in these
here
you know that a push button requires a simple chip but a scroll wheel it it me requires okay so we only need a simple chip
no no that's just a simple chip
a scroll wheel it s uh only states that a scroll wheel requires a regular chip and that a display requires an advanced chip so we don't need any of them
and what's the sample sensor slash sample speaker
okay
back to the costs
so we're gonna use the simple chip
nah there is some money left to be spent
okay but what we have to think about now is that is is it still a special remote control
but i mean it isn't it hasn't got any innovative technology we aren't gonna
apply any uh innovated innovative te technology anyway i think i don't i don't see any possibility to do
so because it would wouldn't fit our defi design philosophy but what w is there some extra
maybe i think maybe the kinetic thing is something
instead of the rechargeable the rechargeable thing was something to um know so y so people wouldn't have to worry about their batteries anymore maybe we if we put the kinetic thing in it
yeah you leave the p yeah i know but still i they will think about that i mean if you u
the uh it's made for s people well the they don't if it was uh uh r useless technology they wouldn't put it uh
as a possibility and i it it th th the the target the target uh group
are people who zap regularly and throw with their remote control as a matter
of speaking because i think it when when there w was a remote control where it was useful
to have a kinetic uh uh power source then it would be this one because it's one
it gets thrown around thrown around a lot and it gets used a lot
hey that maybe that's cool that's a cool thing about it you know you don't use batteries i've never seen it before in a remote control
no we we we can't make a docking station anyway
yeah we can als or uh also m we we can make one we can still make

yeah but be serious then uh the docking station will be a fifth of the price of the remote control
yeah but we uh we don't inc we haven't looked at the these costs of the speaker and other stuff
i don't think it's realistic for you to do so
oh because we
we well look at all the special stuff we have colour a the colours are special the form is special it th this is whole concept uh maybe it with the kinetic thing i think we could do uh do a compromise uh with the kim kinetic thing
uh no
yeah i don my suggestion is to just forget about the whole docking station thing and make it uh like a
uh uh i i i i still fee i also feel this concept of making it kinetic
because of the you know it g it gives something dynamic to the remote control
no that wouldn't n no
yeah and it is also not a good it's not you have to really do it only kinetic you don't want it to think about batteries anymore
no no
yeah it's great
no no no no no this is very sophisticated technology technology when you use it your remote like once a day or maybe even less i i it
it we can make it yeah no becau be but a remote control gets why do they state that this technology can be used if it
yeah m but a w uh uh n uh a calculator also works on r on solar cells
because i think the d whole dynamic part do you know appeals to me qui uh thinking of our design philosophy
you know with the rubber parts and uh sturdiness of the thing and y when you move it around a lot
then people find the idea funny that when i move my remote control around and
yeah but you don't have to trust me the idea of this technology is that you don't think about it it just happens
okay then we d okay well y we don't have to do it but what that would just have a lack of key features you know you m have to put something on your box you have to make people buy it and uh
we can really can do the docking thing uh it's not yeah uh we can do it but it's would be a easy way out
okay but we have to grou to agree upon something because uh we only have a minute left or so
no no it's not possible
okay w b we can s we can leave it on be well then then th it's this is then then our concept is ready
yeah we make some extra profit of it
huh any ideas
no no uh there's still there's still someth concept and something special left i mean we're gonna it's gonna excel in in on in the the range in the field of design and and uh looks and feel
that's what it's makes it special
yeah and i would li i would have liked a kinetic part as well to give it some
just to give it some extra special feature and uh i know it will work but uh it's it's an they're they're not putting technologies on this but if it if it was impossible to
to make it happen
okay well we leave it like this then it's c then we're yeah
okay project e uh well we were gonna what look take a look at the last sheet
yeah we have to yeah it's
uh i don't know

coffee


uh well the uh all the functions are discussed uh i think the most of the functions are uh uh obvious uh it's a little bit uh power button
uh then the the the nine uh channels
uh the volume uh
uh at the side and the other side is the programmes and then we had uh just uh two buttons we place them in the middle uh the menu and for the teletext i thought that was th
oh the mute button
yeah
well yeah mo uh mo yeah well most of them are right handed
yeah well i don't have time in uh anymore on the
oh yeah just progr programme above i think


yeah true yeah
uh
uh i think so
zero
may maybe here
yeah
and then a second
is it depending on television
yeah
true
but the ex
yeah you uh you can wai when you push the one you can show on the telly a one and just a dash and then wait uh two uh seconds or something
we'll discuss them in the usability lab
uh eva evaluation i don't know uh i don't know if if it's it's necessary
yeah
okay
ach
yeah
yeah

well it yeah uh there's nothing i think it's pretty basic the the there's no fu there's one there's one button that's wha there's there's there's one function and that's n the one button when you want to find it
you can
but i i i it's backwards
but it's it's backwards it's leaning it's leaning backwards i think in the in the docking station
that's text

lights
mm
yeah
yeah yeah yeah

okay


yeah
no not fronts different designs different colours maybe yeah
we can make it a one
mm yeah
i agree
um i uh i go for the positive so i go for two
okay three
yeah
two
one one okay yeah i'll i'll agree
i'm the i'm the usability so
yeah
the
well
yeah well menu yeah maybe
yeah true yeah i agree
mm two
because we got

well
yeah
uh i will i will make it a three because uh yeah i i th
yeah true yeah
yeah

no we're not well maybe the the the on the side
and the light maybe
but
well six
no six
six
yeah
innovative in generally or just f original for
a docking station is innova

okay
six
yeah a two
more two
yes
yeah i think two yeah i agree two
we don't have the slogan though
the logo
underneath it or something

a three three
yeah a three
yeah two
two
no
okay yeah
shoot

no
well special colour
i don't
mm okay
whoa it's a little
that's huge
no we have the simplest buttons
uh one til nine is that one or is that nine buttons
yeah
is it cents the the the fifty cents a button
no way

it's way
no no no
yeah uh
that's still four
yeah that's no option that's no option
a special colour why a special colour
but wha what s what special
okay yeah
uh yeah
plastic
plastic i think
plastic
yeah

se no no no

and then we can get a docking station


but what what can we do
but uh what can we do with the simple chip and what's difference with a regular chip and a advanced chip
if if i
regular chip and because we don't have uh special functions to use uh in advanced chip for example
yeah
we'll go back uh tomorrow
that's the question if we do i do we need an advanced chip or is it okay f
no
no no they were uh mine yeah
died
yeah it's open
it's circuit board
it's only just basics for for
at the end circuit there is an infrared led
components design
components design maybe
n on top
working design
yeah but it's the the other one
was it working design or components design
chip set
the display requires an advanced chip
requires
little lights yeah but that that's just the same as the the led
yeah
no
i think uh the uh normal uh simple chip will be okay
yeah
yeah true
well that's not too what we want

so simple chip is okay
yeah lights yeah there's no
category

can we do it wi within two two euro
mm hmm
but it's original
but then we could make a docking station
wow w why no li look at now we got two
two thirty left ca can't we make a docking station of that
i don't know
well we we uh
yeah then we don't have any innovation things

no we only make less profit of it
no


cheap remote control
it w it won't tell but
no uh n no
yeah we just have to go all what we did today again you have to do it over
yeah the
no but no

yeah yeah

no
yeah

we can do it here then
can we can't we do it here

yeah we're doing now but it's
oh okay
nice
yes
'kay we've made a prototype um we've got uh
uh our aspects from the last meeting uh especially we looked at the form material and the colour um we've uh drawn here the p prototype the logo is uh
is uh
is pretty uh obvious to see on the on the remote control but
it is necessary when you want to build your uh company f to a level higher
um
our interface elements there are shown in the in the drawing maybe you can uh point them uh
the functions
but uh that it's uh here then in the middle
yes um
we've disc
most of the users
yes y there there will be a p a little a little p  on that and a little uh yeah


yes
it's a television yes
yes yes you have you have a lot of standard buttons that has to be uh on it uh th with the one and a double uh uh yes
yes you have televisions then you have to you know you have to uh press
yes but but a lot uh
yes but
some televisions don't accept uh that that
no no but s
yes but some some old televisions uh you have to uh click on uh a special button uh then you go to a a next level you can push two buttons
you want
yes but some television don't support it
no a remote can
yes so they need no they need
no but uh
yeah it
and the button for the scart uh audio video uh external input
no no
uh remote control sends one signal at one button uh press
uh some
n some televisions when when you want to go further than uh ten
no you have to you have to uh give the television uh two or more signals when you uh press one button you give one signal and the older televisions need more signals to go a level higher
but
when you make the technology that that it will uh give more signals
it could work but
just a basic idea of of of the most uh most y
most common uh and simple uh operations on the remote
yes it's here on the

we came uh
yes
but maybe we can maybe we can make the docking station uh uh a bit standard
for for uh the other products we sell because real real
reaction sells more products than only remote controls so maybe we can uh use the docking station
for example uh m p  three players or or uh
uh hearing devices
yes but when you put that same volt voltages on it you can put uh when the when the when uh o the the the lowest part of it when it's o the same as the other products you can put it all on the same uh
yes but we can make
no we can make uh make the most lowest part all the same
when when the the recharger has a has a bit what points out we can place all on top of it
just have to be big enough for the biggest
no when you make it large enough no it it will not but then it's a little bit
but it's just an idea
but it's flat it's flat as as this so we can p make all the products as flat as this
yes but when you make uh uh a bit of big
yes little holer littler uh little products go deeper in it
yes and uh uh
the f the look and feel would be great on this uh remote control because uh you always uh
will uh pick up the remote control in the in the smallest uh area then your uh left
thumb of uh your right thumb is uh near the programme uh button
which is the most common used uh function and all the other buttons are available for your uh thumb
so it's it's it's really good design
yes uh on the side uh there will be a strip of rubber and in the middle uh there is uh a hard uh a hard material a bit hard plastic with a light uh behind it
yes we can make also n neon lights on it or or the buttons that can make uh light on it
yes
but it will also uh uh use batteries and do we want to
the all the aspects of the interface buttons were uh
yes
yes
yes maybe we can use on the on the lights on the side we can use uh uh multiple uh lights so it will uh
yes
no


yeah
i think i think the the fronts will give it a more uh uh uh less uglier uh side because you can uh make it in your own yes you can make it in your own uh
more to your own personality or or house style
yes
or forty

i think two or three
yes
yes
yes
yes
it's all about the buttons
also the the the buttons of the one the two the the digits o they're used uh uh
can yes three two
but you can't make a remote control without them because
yes
yes a one

we we've tried to make it uh the the best trendy look uh ever

yes
yes
no
no not l c d  so
but that that's not innovative lights lights are
six
because we've tried to make it a little bit innovative but it but it
with the lights it it's it's kind of future
but still you can retrieve it when it's when it's gone with the with
yes the docking station is a is a little bit innovative it's a part of the remote and with the speaker on the there's also a speaker
okay
but the retrieval or the
yes how would you innovate a remote control more
to put it on your head


yes
yes

you like the buttons
yes
in in and comparing with uh people of th of the age above
we don't know but
yes two but only in c when you compare it with with elderly
this is just guessing
make it a two
when it succeeds uh it can get a two mu
a logo
yes uh encrypted uh with
yes
yes
is there something after this uh meeting or
okay
yes
uh it's it's one one chip but but you have to choose one from it
the simple chip is e enough i i think but with the lights with the lights and the retrieval it can be uh
no uh i
yes my my my uh
the the email i got said uh simple chip but when we put in the speaker and the
retriever uh device it will uh cost a a bit more like
i think the advanced chip maybe
bec no the they didn't know about a retriever or a speaker uh in it
then it's a simple chip
yes i i i s i
that will be enough for future uh recommendations
i don't know it uh either
yes
otherwise you get uh a standard uh plastic colour
standard rubber
st
yes
no it's only uh when you use push buttons it will cost that much if you use a scroll wheel
maybe it's the kind of push buttons you can have f four kind of push buttons
rubber you can have uh
different yes
why is that so uh expensive
so whe when you so then it
it's eighty percent of the price of the of the amount of
when you have the same amount of button you have to put in wi in your carton board and then throw it

but whe
i've seen one uh one remote control with only the pu yeah only with uh page up page down and volume but but
uh it's it's still for little children they can handle that remote control but but it isn't fo
yes it's for it's li uh it's just for a little
otherwise it
otherwise it would be the
special form also it says
what is the normal material
sh yeah
classic oh plastic
but we can uh sell the remote control and uh sell the docking station
yes and and but we don't have to tell it but what we can say of can um
almost make it impossible to buy a remote control without the docking station

no but you otherwise you can't retrieve it
but for two euros and thirty cents we uh we don't get a docking station
for
for two euros

it isn't in my information so i don't know it uh either it isn't in my information i uh i i've got a
schematic view of the remote control but nothing about uh advanced chips or
uh i've got here in uh i will put a i will put a page on it
when my mouse works again
my mouse is uh
yes
oh
ah i've got it i will put uh
my email on the
the network
it's on it
yes
um
yes that was mine
but that was my second
mm
but this is the same uh
this is o only the possibilities
yeah
we can use a simple a regular or advanced chip
ah okay
with the light
l c d 
maybe you can say against the remote uh page uh f uh page up page down
all in twelve euros
twelve euros and fifty cents
and the lights where uh are the lights
but but sometimes you put a
kinetics aren't uh nowadays only used in watches and that's because you're always walking
uh solar cells are useless

fo for a docking station with a cable with uh buttons on it with retrieval uh device in it
wi with a button to
wi with a button to retrieve it so it will beep uh so it's uh wireless technology
look at the case the case the case of of uh of uh
no then we have to sell it for thirty euros
it's the
maybe we can uh can do it both maybe we can do it both uh in the in the in the remote battery and kinetic

yes but when it's then when it then you have to shake it uh and all when it's when it's empty


you asked for three d
no that's n that's not true uh a watch is uh kinetic because you walk all the time
yes solar cells are also stated
why don't we use solar cells then
that's true
oui
you can do it for fifty cents
the c the case the case alone is is is uh
the case alone for uh remote control is at least one euro
then we have one euro thirty for the whole docking station
but now
great it's great
our remote control
yes
seventy euros
why not a hand dynamo then

we're done
is this it
okay
yes
where's the champagne
i don't uh hear a bell

bye

uh huh
just fill that one in


alright i
yeah
alright and uh you gotta point out which is the volume um uh button and which is the programme button
yeah but you you gotta make it clear on the on
yeah and a and a triangle on that
yes next to that i kinda miss a zero actually



all n no that's um kinda dependent on the television
i think
yeah i think you should add
a cross or whatever yeah line
no that's dependent on the television
i do know so
yeah
yes but uh uh no uh remote control nowadays are um they come with the television or actually the other way around but
yeah
yeah well but su if
no no no so some television respond differently look if uh i i
yes
yes that's true
no
no it it it works uh if you haven't got uh a special button for it uh if you push a one then on your television there will appear a one and a a line which is an empty space
yep true
no s some some televisions need the input first uh and and you c
no that's not true it's simply not true it's simply not true uh
no remote control doesn't give signal after five seconds remote control is a stupid thing if you push a button it sends it immediately to to the television
no definitely not definitely not

yes
uh you can access that uh via zero and then minus i guess yeah
yep
okay i kinda miss the docking station

no nothing really trendy about it
the button
yep
i think that's very difficult because of different shapes of uh uh devices
yeah of course
mm hmm
well it it got it it has got to fit into the shape of course
the technology and the voltage can be the same that's uh that's true but uh i if you all make the m having a bottom like this then they all fit
yeah that's true but uh
yes but uh i i g
shouldn't it fall then it isn't going to fall down that's a bit uh yeah i think
no but if if like this i'll i'll point it out if you got uh a a a base a base like this i won't draw it really if you got a base which is uh as big as this
yeah sure but if you got if you got a tiny player it can
yeah uh wha what you could do if you uh from the bottom oh right help uh you could make like a hole in it you know of uh in in the
yeah that i that is possible yep
yeah sure you're right
oh
i don't like the colours
mm hmm
yeah alright
the light
okay and other lights
no o on the on the front
yeah okay maybe the uh the logo
yeah why not
of course
okay
uh in the same colour as the side
yeah i think i think that'll be good
yes
yep
yeah
we will
well uh yeah i i'm gonna do something right there yeah
we gotta do that on the right the most right most screen because the leftmost
yep that's me
alright i will be needing that image so leave it please um
go away
right we're gonna evaluate that design according to a few points
um we g the four of us are going to do that um together i wanna have
a colour over here come on right the remote is not ugly a bit weird sentence
but
the positive things has to be on the left so i said not ugly instead of ugly uh
what would you say we we gotta give points to uh to all of these to evaluate uh that design
and please forget the drawing skills of these guys the
remote control is not ugly how do you feel
yes
background colour
how do you guys feel
the different designs yes
okay
no not not fronts but different designs
and that's still uh uh yeah is is uh is a little personal touch i guess what
yeah wha wha what would you uh guys uh think personally
personally
yes but what is it
guido
two or three
i was
i was thinking about three so i guess
three is uh a bit uh oh what am i doing i'll mark it the remote control's uh uh that n makes uh zapping easy
yeah antek you agree
yeah you're not antek
i totally agree the remote control the remote control's relevant buttons are prominently visible
yeah i yeah i would say a one because uh every button is uh uh relevant and our oh yeah it's a b yeah yeah alright that's a one you agree
the remote control hasn't got too much redundant or unneeded buttons i think we totally succeeded there oh
yeah that's true that's true
the the yeah m well you d you've got a point
two or three
two antek
nay that that that's true that's true they're definitely needed so
we put it on a two
the remote control has got a really trendy look
maarten
yeah
ever yeah guido
yeah uh i agree i agree
i was planning to give it a two uh where i give the not ugly uh oh yeah that's true you agree on the two
great remote control hasn't got too much redundant or unneeded buttons
uh i copied that one
well uh forget that um
go away remote control has got innovative technology implanted
yeah and the light
well i g
it's not seven
why uh why not a seven
how
yeah you think the lights are innovative
well it's n true uh i agree m but
i'll
yeah you you didn't draw the docking station
yeah it it's i think i think with its
i think more m
uh that that's n
no uh well the agenda says evaluate now so i think we
it's it's a six
that m f yeah for the retrieval function
yeah i think that's very innovative for a remote control


yeah sure but
but i d i definitely don't think it's a five but
remote control is easy to use
i think a two yeah
come on the remote control hasn't got uh
i've just filled uh
go away
i found twelve questions so much but it still is ten
it will be bought by people under the age of forty
no no no no just if they if they buy it
yeah what do you think
antek
no that's no comparison
and i don't mean two people
w w
right the rem
the remote control has recognisable corporate image colour logo or slogan
oh the slogan can we see the slogan
are we gonna do that
three i agree
because of the slogan remote control's got a basic design intended uh for novice users
two two alright
we gotta add up the scores now to see our total average four five seven nine forget that fifteen seventeen twenty one twenty four twenty six
twenty six
it's a two point six
alright we yeah
yeah true
this was my evaluation so
we did a pretty nice job until now
um is this your
whatever
well i think we gotta fill out another questionnaire

yeah
a five a five
doesn't matter
we probably will
the amount yeah
i don't know
i haven't got an idea on on which we need to use really
yeah
yeah
and how do you know i mean you got that email did it point out what to use them for
alright well point out the advanced chip for now i guess
i don't know
i don't know if it's very special
alright that's okay
no
i don't think so because it says amount the the the yellow row is the amount of
to n that's total of four buttons
i think that
eighteen one two three four five si
fifty cents for one single stupid button
yeah exactly yeah
i can't i i i couldn't understand it if it was fifty cents per uh uh per button really
yeah yeah
no really
yeah but i d i wouldn't want to own that really
yeah
i don't think the special form is really true
is it
yeah i dunno
plastic
no
yeah i really don't get it i mean if it's a simple chip then we suddenly got two euros and thirty cents
yeah yep
i think so too
oh i don't know
uh why i mean i i if you if it would cost two euros that had a total a total thing it would be nice too i mean uh we're not gonna add uh a trip to hawaii to it
i like the hand dynamo part
we can make a plain docking station for two euros i mean
wi wi without recharge
yeah but but we can make a docking station for two euros uh if you don't put the recharge function in it i mean
it has a shape of course it has a shape but i i
why should that not be possible
no for for the uh for the docking station if you do if you choose the simple chip
yes
dead
reanimate it
what the hell are these
oh whatever

this isn't helpful
no that was my presentation
it's already open
it's at the bottom
it's uh at your task bar
oh
sorry
okay sorry
yeah nice i it doesn't say anything
that's not needed
a display uh is of course uh for showing letters for showing text i don't think that uh just a l a little light
yeah i agree
yeah i guess so too
next channel
no well we might want it but
yeah
great delete yeah
well there're three i guess
i think we can make a docking station yeah
no that's true
m bu
or the hand dynamo dynamo
yeah
yeah but but if we ca
i don't know if
five minutes
that's not true
we can make a docking station for two thirty
two thirty
we can make a docking station sure
sure
the power device is is i i is very cheap that's just a regular uh power cable and whatever
so
yeah
well then it's a useless project
can't we uh
can't we say fifteen euros
no sta yeah i mean
no
you can sell for twenty seven and a half
then you make as much profit as you would with twelve and a half production costs
i don't think
no
thirteen twenty
and i think only
yeah but only kinetic then you gotta
you you gotta throw uh throw it through the room like twenty times an hour really
no
yeah it's funny for a week i guess something like that where you have to move it around very frequently is demotivating
no i i don't move my uh my remote control very much seriously
well we've got more than fifty cents
yeah no we won't but that's um something else no this not gonna sell no
of course not
we come back tomorrow okay
we can't do anything else warning finish meeting now
yeah sure
no we can't
yes yes celebration i don't see why but
i think we gotta fill out another questionnaire to be honest
no not yet
alright i'll see you guys in a minute
i don't think so
i don't know i don't i don't think so
okay here we go
alright the agenda for thi oh
alright um the agenda for this meeting is um we'll initially
have the prototype presentation by our two designers and then we will evaluate it
given the criteria that um that we gave
gave it and um talk about our finances whether we were under or over our budget
i have a um a spreadsheet where we can calculate um our prices for every aspect
of of what we've made given our options and um evaluate the product
as a group and um
so first we'll have the prototype presentation do you need the um powerpoint for this
alright
on a mango okay
oh okay
oops
yeah
notice you have a number ten button
okay
no problem ah
oh you press a plus button
oh okay i've never heard of that kind before
yeah
yeah
oh
i
but
would you have to go zero plus one if you wanted to go to channel one or two
yeah but i mean if you press it'll go to that channel right away 'cause you gotta press the plus afterwards
yeah i know but if if i wanna go to say number like sixty five channel sixty five if i press the six it'll go to channel six and then i'll press the plus and then it'll go to six and then put the five and it'll go to sixty five
i th
um
yeah it wouldn't be a problem but i was just wondering like as long as we realise that's what it'll do
yeah
c  and v 
right where um where's the power button
oh okay
yeah
yeah
oh okay
yeah ergonomic definitely ergonomic

the spon yeah
yeah bit of a stress ball feel
yes i would
my goodness there you go genevieve yeah
and something hmm
oh right
yeah it looks more
think like vanilla and banana would
okay yeah

kinda christmas you know
yeah
cool

alright thank you very much good work everyone
alright and so now that we've we have a prototype uh we need to go over the finances and seeing if this prototype matches uh what our budget can handle so i have
something i'm going to
oh wait a minute do you need to do a presentation first
yeah i'm gonna check that out for a second
what time is it anyw
oh yeah sorry you're right evaluation criteria is next in line yeah
just press um function eight again
and then again i think
one more time
yeah
yeah
okay
ooh
yeah
the look is a little bit more playful
oh definitely different yeah
oh you were only given red and black
oh okay
yeah
okay
yeah
yeah
it's mango it's mango

yeah i would say two personally
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah i'd say maybe three
yeah we want it simple
yeah
i think so yeah
yeah one
th
the plus number thing
yeah colour will definitely be a factor
i think that the logo could be smaller
and maybe not such a prominent way maybe like at the bottom kind of
oh it just had to be on there i guess

i like the appeal of it being like a big glob in your hand
maybe if the bottom was just sort of flat and then the rest is like
round
it would still be comfortable i think we c we could handle it i think
ah it'd fall over all the time though it'd be annoying

'kay we're done designing come on
i think it was another colour and it was like i think it'd look okay i think maybe a two
sure
yeah
yeah
durable
but you're our marketing expert
oh exactly exactly
yeah i would give it a two still though
mm
oh yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
we have the alarm system
i thought the light from the inside was gonna light up
or or was it gonna make a noise
you press the button it makes a noise right
yeah awesome awesome
i though w it was gonna make a noise
okay
oh okay whoo okay
yeah totally
no problem mm
totally
yeah
yeah so it's just like channel six six enter
yeah but you don't have to press zeros
and then like twelve enter
yeah

yeah
i think so it's like right in the
your thumb might get a little bit uh
yeah
but it is soft
and that's kind of what the um
the powerpoint slide thing said would be good for r s i  so maybe it is but
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yes we did
well yeah the colours are yellow and grey so it could be grey on the banana one
yeah
mm yeah
hum
i would say so
but maybe more like two 'cause there's no like pictures of fruit it's just sort of naming it by a fruit
with the with the colours
yeah
yeah
that's fashionable in itself to have interchangeable plates
be like
yeah
maybe if it was scented yeah we have money for that um
alright so based on this evaluation do we average them out sorta thing
oh
i would say two
one point nine or something i don't know these things um between one and two
alright
yeah
i'm attempting to do that right now
yeah it is one point nine ooh
go heather pauls
yeah
alright now with that over and done with our next step is to see if we are under budget and um my computer's frozen
and now it's not okay so
um in our shared folder if everyone could go there right now um
i'm going to um steal a cable um it's it's um
it's an excel file oh
yeah 'kay there we go um production costs and um i have to access that as well one moment
'kay so far i've added what i think or what is going on great
it's blinking at me
it's locked for editing read only i'm gonna open up a second one then 'cause it's locked for editing i have the original in my um
my email account
i dunno
no no i was hoping that you guys could
um there we go
okay here we go so we need to tally up how much our w our product will be costing
so um if you can look up at the screen um the large screen oh i guess
looking at your own too and telling me which one you think okay we're using kinetic which is quite
a large expense at three euros
um we're using a regular chip
um it's cur it's double curved so its curved all around that's another three we're already at five um we're using plastic and rubber so
good thing plastic is free we're at eight um
s
yeah i guess we should do it just for one kind so it's like special colour well we'll have two colours right well one colour for the case one colour for the buttons so we can
um we have push button interface so that's inexpensive and um we have a special colour for the button and we also have a special form
and a special material
which puts us just barely under budget hurray
yeah good work guys so um our operating cost is twelve twenty euros
awesome
and back to our powerpoint so we've
'kay yes we are so we need to do a product evaluation again which is probably um
i dunno a different extension of a
hmm
yeah 'cause we're talking about leadership teamwork
yeah alright so um
do you guys feel like there was room for creativity
pushed for creativity
ye okay so it'd be like
need more time and
materials but you were allowed m creativity i think so as like but you were supposed to have creativ
right
right
okay
great
leadership
is this me being like guys do you like me um
yeah
yeah
oop okay teamwork i think we worked great as a team
yeah
alright how were our means
we needed more play doh colours
yeah

but ever
everything else was satisfactory is that good

yeah

new ideas found i don't really know what that means
hmm
yeah
yeah
yeah each other's
mm
okay well with that achieved our last slide is our closing slide
yes our costs are within budget it's evaluated generally positively and
um don't forget to complete final questionnaire and meeting summary then we celebrate
in such a way that i have no idea
alright
okay bye
okay
um yeah i just got a few slides so show them
thank you
do you want to present it
yeah here we are
mango shape
the l e d 
so it's palm held
yeah
you just need the nought

so one plus one would be eleven or
yeah because if you on your average um remote if you press one
twice you just go to um or uh say you wanted channel twelve you press one and then you go to channel
one and then two then you'd just go to channel two instead of twelve so if you did like one plus two
you could go to channel twelve or two plus two is channel twenty two
oh
well i don't mind we can further define that
i wouldn't have thought it'd be a problem that it went to channel six first in like on the way to channel sixty five
but i suppose it's not as snappy
yeah yeah if you don't put it
yeah yeah that yeah
mm hmm
um
and channel which is so you could just go like that without thinking about it like
it's the bigger r 
so it's just like we deci
yeah um we went for like a a circular
design for the numbers because we thought that's kind of a more natural movement than just going like that with your thumb
uh e ergonomics are all considered yeah
it could cause another type of repetitive stress injury though but yeah no i mean it's a different movement so
yeah um and the feel of it i mean we've made this out of play doh which is representing
the you know the rubber and the spongy rubberness um 'cause it was
said before in the material specification that this the this anti r s i  um material
is often used in stress balls so this has got a you know a bit of give to it and it just feels feels different would you like to feel
it yourselves how it fits in the palm of your hand
thanks and you

o
okay as for the colours we were presented with um a limited range of colours for this prototype
but we're thinking that seeing as we're having it in interchangeable casing anyway that
this is not necessarily a representation of the true colours that we would necessarily use or the combination
um and we're thinking to carry on with the fruit and vegetable theme the colour um combination
just could just be named after different fruit like banana could be black and yellow watermelon red and
green or vanilla might be the most popular if it just uh blends in more settled
cream instead of the others are all a bit garish
banana's more representative of our colour scheme like the company the yellow and black
so that for corporate identity that would probably be the most strength i mean watermelon you know m probably appealing to the yeah seasonal
apple green brown more kinda trendy you know khaki
yeah
okay um yeah we thought of the components it was definitely um a focus
of ergonomics and just a single ha handheld device i mean you don't need to use both hands one
hand to hold this and type in with the other you can just use your thumb
um as we said the rubber's probably used for comfort and anti r s i  and that's about it

mm hmm
mm go

feel i think we've been quite successful with the rubber coating and
yeah
i think the colour has a lot to do with it i mean th the colours we were given for
making the prototype aren't the colours that i think we would've necessarily chosen it's not the kind of
ooh uh at all sleek red black and yellow and orange
um
but if you can imagine that in like a s just a maybe uh a kind of pale metallic y finish or something
well i know know it's for rubber i mean diff if you can visualise this in nice colours i think it would look quite fancy
oh well potato mango fruit and veg
potato's fine potato's fine
yeah totally it's really adaptable
for the
fancy
i uh two three
yeah and the use of the rubber
for the anti r s i 
the l e d  use isn't particularly innovative and we don't have any scroll buttons
it's all pushbuttons there's no l c d  control so if we're thinking about the rest of the market
it's sort of probably halfway in some aspects it is like we said
yeah though it was our specification
yeah yeah
yeah
yeah and perhaps the turning on but
mm
again i think the colour comes into this
okay
not in
don't worry
i suppose i've got quite big hands

thing is like that it's not going anywhere particularly
yeah
uh yeah it's less um what's th ha
h it's got higher centre of gravity like that
i would definitely go for that rather than like your average plain old remote like that but definitely in another colour i'm not happy with those colours
yeah
yeah
yeah and the kinetic energy shaker style y whoo ooh no
but you know those'll be firmly on

mm yeah that's true
yeah good point
yeah yeah
does this prototype match the operating behaviour of the average user
yeah
because yeah because the most accessible buttons are the volume and the and the channel changing
and it's just you won't have to think about it you don't have to look down to find them they're clearly there
easy to use simple
yeah mm
yeah
it
yeah l lights on and or flash as well but i mean it's not obviously obvious from the outside that that's gonna happen 'cause you can't s particularly see an alarm
yeah but when the alarm's not yeah if you
yeah
you could s yeah
well the thing is if it was had an alarm system i mean when it when it lights up as we i mean it could light up when the alarm went but if it was hidden underneath the cushion or something there wouldn't be any point so you can't see the alarm but it would light up
yeah alarm but you can't see an alarm inside uh the alarm system itself
yeah yeah it w yeah sorry
yeah sorry heather that wasn't very clear
yeah i think just because it's we've decided to reduce it down to the basic buttons i think that in itself makes it so much easier to use
mm
and or sixty six enter y
yeah i think that's probably more straightforward yeah good
ooh mm
oh
injury
yeah that's what i was thinking we may have to do some more research into other strain injuries that we don't know about
mm hmm
mm
yeah
i think we're getting that's true
mm
i think yeah i think too


yeah
mm
yeah i think this is the
the factor that we've been least successful in confronting
yeah
four i think well i don't what do what
okay

yeah like um the colour scheme names and stuff

yeah
yeah yeah
it is
the thing is i think if somebody saw that and you said what was that inspired from i don't know if you'd instantly say mango
oh yeah there we go that would be great
um
okay
it's
between one and two
so that's pretty fantastic
mm
it seems like it should be more around two
do we have an online calculator
okay
oh wow well done well that's excellent
production costs
it says it
i think it just means that we can't add any more to it now have you have you completed it
oh right okay
okay

yeah
yeah
yeah
double double curved yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
mm hmm
oof
congratulations guys
of the actual project rather than the product
a project is is yeah
so wh how we actually went round uh about doing it
i think we were pushed
i mean we weren't really given a lot of time or materials yeah to go about our design task so i think we could've done with a bit more time

yeah
yeah
yeah well we were just limited by resources really and like if we had decided to use the l c d  screen and like solar power backup and everything then we wouldn't have been able to afford that so that did limit
creativity just resources but yeah
the fruit and veg idea

yeah we did we've uh seeing as we've come out with what we intended a pro um a product within the budget i think that's a sign of good leadership and also our personal coach helped us along the way so you know
i think it's been fine
yeah good timing
and project manager of course
yeah
yeah
um
yeah and more play doh 'cause that was all the red we had so even if we wanted to make a bigger prototype we wouldn't have been able to
yeah it could be really straightforward for the computer i think the only thing was having to remember to you know to tick the okays but i think i was the only one who struggled with that
mm
uh me too yeah
well i think we've all learnt stuff from each other like the n um yeah just about each different got new ideas from each other
yeah
yeah
sorry
oh yeah well mm did it come into the into i dunno if we counted that in the costs
yes
uh
fantastic
okay brilliant thank you very much
um
this is what we came up with it's a pretty simple design it's um based on a mango yeah and we
yeah and we have the company logo here and this will be the
infrared here and this'll be the power point the on off button kind yeah
it's in the middle of one of the little r s and then the other one is the power and uh we just have a simple design we wanted it all to be
accessible from your thumb yeah palm held and all the
buttons are accessible from your thumb
so you don't have to
oh that was a mistake wasn't it right no that's a zero take that one off
sorry i was in charge of the numbers
and this is just if you've got like eleven or twelve or
thirt the plus you can go one three or something you press that first and then you go one three yeah
well we just thought we have all the numbers here so we wanted something representative of numbers larger than ten and
so the plus and then yeah
no no th all that's why we have all these numbers these numbers um
these numbers all work independently up to nine
yeah
oh no uh the plus is only for if you're going past the number nine
you p
oh
no you press the plus first i i well it doesn't we haven't really s i would've thought you pressed the plus first and then the six five but she says plus press which what do you think is simpler it's a
yeah
yeah
oops
yeah
yeah
yeah so
a channel
just so we can flick
it's in the middle of one of the little r s
yeah so it's all accessible without m taking your hand off the remote
and it might actually help with the repetitive stress injury as well okay
yeah

yeah
yeah
yeah
of play doh yeah
'cause it'd be quite subtle and
yeah

yeah yeah yeah
the pomegranate's kinda girly and funky kind of and then the vanilla's more for the more sophisticated customer who just wants something that fits in with all decor
yeah

mm
well
yeah
yeah
yeah so not very sleek and we don't wanna go for black because most remote controls are black or grey so we want it to be stand out that way anyway
yeah a metallic y finish we were thinking
polished okay
yeah
we we were we were thinking about yeah
i w i'd say two i think
fanciness
yeah
yeah
mm
i'll go for three as well
no wouldn't be simple yeah
yeah
yeah very i think one for that yeah no
yeah that's the only thing yeah

it's definitely
yeah
but the
remember the management said that it it had to be prominent
yeah
yeah but you know what i've just thought of there now what where's it gonna sit in your living room is it not gonna fall off the arm of the sofa
yeah but then it wouldn't sit as comfortably in your hand
yeah
oh that would be nice
yeah

three you would though 'cause it's bit it's more interesting than other remotes
yeah
yeah
i think we have to market it in the right way that um to say that it is simplistic so people don't just see it and think uh this is so simplistic i don't want to spend twenty five euros we have to market it
and the kinetic energy part yeah don't shake
oh no the plus you're use the zero make a new one
i think they're about ten po ten pound aren't they about ten pounds fifteen
yeah

mm
yeah
i think it does very well
the zap yeah
uh
yeah
yeah the bu when you press the alarm system the lights behind the and it'll vibra
it'll be again in the marketing
yeah the light it will
but
but both
yeah
oh that would be brilliant i'd be tempted to
yeah
it would have to be in the market
yeah but you still couldn't see it
it would just be a little speaker on the back or something


so the plu the plus w once that's written down on the page that'll be really simple won't it
yeah
that kind of annoys me though when it's zero six when you have to press i don't know why
oh okay right
alright aye
yeah
i'd say w yeah one yeah
yeah
hmm
but if you're zapping yeah i don't think it will f
yeah the biology
mm
yeah
yeah
i i'd say t two yeah
yeah
n we we can't really do that because for example on the banana theme we can't have it as being yellow it won't stand out so n it's not always gonna be the same colour
gray yeah
yeah could be grey
yeah that's right we didn't even rea
yeah
perhaps a metallic or or like that's grey and it wouldn't be that expensive to have a little bit of metal no
that isn't rubber

okay

following that briefing we did
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
i think w yeah i think one well that was our brief and we followed the brief well we haven't got a big banana but
oh yeah
no
no
oh that would be class

yeah two
it's
yeah
close to two yeah
i got
yeah 'cause we've a four to bring down
uh aye
yeah uh should've added five
this is
yay

is that the project document
yeah
oh right
what about a special colour are we using that
yeah
and a special material yeah

that's good

yeah

the ma
or materials
yeah
yeah
yeah
creativity


yeah

yeah

yeah
yeah

yeah
yeah it c it might've been bigger
yeah


i'm actually not sure if i've saved my presentations

yeah through discussion
yeah
and we were a able to modify each other's ideas
to fit in with our areas of expertise
if if it if it
if it can be afforded

yeah
yay

yeah


i'm sorry what was the where's the l e d 
oh okay


oh there's no e okay
okay
sixty

well the there is a there's a delay on remotes i think where you can have it it's like a five second input time so as long as you hit them dada
it should be fine as long as there's not a big pause between the t hitting the two buttons
was there so on the top there is volume and
channel up volume up okay cool
yeah
it's the r 
mm hmm
mm hmm




yes oh it's nice oh i think i killed the five i did i killed the four oh god
oh it smells good

bravo
you want the
i don't know what order it goes in i have one
evaluation cri okay that's me
hello
oh there we go
okay come on my computer come on
sorry my computer's giving me technical difficulties should i press it again
last time i did that it sh
okay you're right
oh still not there
okay now i think for this one i could would you guys prefer use the whiteboard or mayb maybe i'll just do it on right on the screen where you can see it um we're gonna be doing an evaluation report together based on the protoptype that we've just seen
um and looking looking back at my notes from our both our conceptual and our functional meetings um i made
a list of what our original requirements and goals were um back to our kick off meeting this morning um and
we'll evaluate as to whether we've s done what we set out to do
um and we're gonna do it on a one to seven scale where one is true and seven is false so basically the lower p the lower the points the better
okay so question number one does the remote whoops sorry oh i'm not gonna be able um i'll do it on the whiteboard i can't change it so i'm g i'm gonna ask you to push it down once
i'll write down our scores up on the
okay so number one do we have a fancy look and feel
yeah i guess that depends on your definition of fancy but it's definitely different it's not your traditional yeah
mm hmm
yeah
mm hmm
yeah i kinda i like the potato look it's very different it's what oh sorry the mango the mango look yeah it is fruit or vegetable depends on your mood
so i myself would say a one or a two
it's a two
okay and p
one being true so
two okay actu that's pro that's gonna get confusing like that okay so question number two was is it techn technologically innovative so i know we have the kinetic energy which is very innovative

use of the rubber the use of the l e d 
isn't
mm hmm
yeah and i think i mean it it's tough to say because we were we didn't want it to be any more innovative than this because then that would've defeated the purpose so i mean i we'll put three but i think we actually reached our goal
we didn't want it any more than that okay question number three uh will it be easy to use
yeah yeah s
yeah i think it's you can't really get confused with that i mean there'll be s we have to work out the uh number the plus system but once that's figured out it should be fine
number four is this a good looking remote remember that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly
mm hmm
whoops
should just not touch it this time it's the three i killed i was just wondering if it should be like flatter
or
well
yeah the bottom could be like ch chopped a bit
oh that's true
maybe it could it could be on the bottom so you wouldn't loo like if it's flat here so it sits up like that
i g
if it's weighted maybe details details okay so is this a good looking remote would we wanna show it off to our friends
yeah
yeah
i mean i gue yeah it's personal taste but
yeah
okay so should we say two for that yeah
okay uh question number five what's um will people be willing to spend twenty five euros on this product remember that eighty percent of users were willing to spend more money when a remote control looked fancy
mm hmm
yeah it the marketing will have a lot to do with it
shake it and the buttons fall off
no i guess i don't know much about the remote control industry how much your average sells for but i know i am aren't i
but you don't have to buy batteries so in the long term this can actually save you money so we'll market it that way too
so yeah i think with a good marketing scheme um and the personalisation options it'll
yeah okay number six can someone read it out or
um yeah so that was mainly that the statistics we said
mm hmm

yeah i guess the i think the key word there is average 'cause there were some people that used the uh video input and sound and stuff but they're
not you and i really so okay so one okay number
seven c heather could you push it down will this remote control be easy to find when lost remember that fifty percent
of users lose their remote regularly now is there the is the alarm system still was it implemented


it turns into a duck and starts quacking here i am um
okay
we oh you're just explaining why it's not on the prototype but yeah it'll be there so we can we could say that
we can give it a one because compared to every other remote ever m ever made this one will be easier to find okay um
question number eight will it be easy to learn how to use this remote when brand new remember that thirty four percent of users usually found it difficult so it has to be yeah it's eas they'll pick it up and they'll know what to do the plus thing needs to be worked on
yeah
well
do
does it make more sense for the middle one to be an just an enter button so then you would have to push two buttons every time at least

you could just press six enter or one two enter yeah
um okay so we can we'll say yes it's uh one okay
question number nine uh will it minimise the effects of r s i  which was repeated strain injury um which affected over a quarter of users
s
it's soft and
and people could
mm hmm
i don't know what other options there are
could i mean you could hold it in your left hand and d use your index finger but there's not really any other options unless it's like a keyboard so i think we did as as much as you can with a remote control
so one or two do you think
two okay okay number ten did we somehow incorporate the company colour and logo now is the colour gonna be there even if it's like vanilla is the yellow
mm hmm
it sounds like the colour's something that we
but i mean the yell yeah d yellow's ugly though depending on the
so i think we'll have to talk to our executive managers and see if we can get away with just the r r 
okay
yeah and the buttons in the middle
okay so do you think that's more of a three then three four
four
well we have good reasons for it so we but we can still put a
a four
okay and final question um did we stay true to our motto and put the fashion into electronics current trends of fruits and veggies desire for sponginess

yeah
no uh are the plates interchangeable i think i missed a few they are so you can have banana and kiwi and okay okay so that's something that's kind of in the making too like maybe it'll become more
mm hmm


yes we do so i wh what was i gonna put for that a two for fashion
okay so our average there five six eight ten eleven twelve thirteen fifteen nineteen twenty one divided by eleven
is
between okay um
yeah that's very good 'cause the highest we coulda got is one
does that seem right then
okay

sorry are you gonna do that okay
oh is it locked 'cause i'm in it
or okay
mm 's good
mm hmm
yeah and the conceptual and functional like we were very creative in in coming up with an idea i guess but m
when we can down to it okay
mm hmm

yeah
good leadership i think we stayed on task
mm hmm

and the timing was good we never were pushed for time or sat around doing nothing so

was good teamwork
i think we are well suited to our roles

oh really
okay
yeah the computer programmes are good the
yeah i don't think there was anything
yeah


they'll probably still be there
um
i'm not sure new ideas found
yeah well i guess we really it we bounced off of each other which was cool like based on marketing stuff and then you'd say something about interface and yeah worked well
mm hmm
oh does it have smart materials by the way
does it have smart materials
oh yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
by watching t v 
mm
conclusion dadada
okay
so we are here for the concept design meeting
so we will first start by summarizing the mm the previous meeting and the decision we've taken
uh i will take notes during this meeting so uh that you can uh look at my uh folder to see the summary of this meeting afterwards
so each of you will uh show us the various investigation they've done during uh previous uh hours
we'll then t take decision in concert and then uh uh we will uh define the nest next task to have to be done before the next meeting
so last time we decided to have a simple interface
we also decided to have a wheel to change channel previous channel button channel
digit uh buttons should be uh protected by plastic cover or something for
the remote control to look very simple
we have also button for volume and to switch on off the t v 
we have also uh the lightening feature for the remote control to be easy to find and for fast development and low cost we have decided to have no l c d  no voice features
so now uh we will have three presentations so the conceptual specification
by industrial designer the specification of the u i  by
or u i  okay
and uh the last point is uh trend watching by market expert
so maybe we can start with uh industrial design
so this is the presentation
maybe i can switch slide uh on your request
yeah
yeah
okay
okay
but is it a significant price on the whole remote control because we can afford up to twelve euros for the price of the remote control
so will will will this with uh including all possible things so buttons wheel and the chip be uh lower than twelve euros to produce
okay
you received something
hmm
and could it be adapted
okay and there can uh recognize some commands and stuff
okay
yeah
okay maybe we can just uh listen to this presentation and then take decision later on according to those news
okay
you can easily find the button in the dark or so
it will be turned on when the when the user move the remote control i think no
hmm
yeah yeah
yeah true
but it can be uh battery consuming no
to have the light always on
well we will discuss that after maybe
the other presentations
yeah
and it is
okay
yeah yeah
yeah
and also does it uh fit well in hand because it was uh th your wrist problem with the usage
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah so it's only the central part
yeah with a maybe a more ergonomic design on on the bottom part
yeah
okay
okay
okay s
okay will be down or okay
okay
okay
okay
mm
yeah
maybe the wheel will be a good advantage over our competitors
because otherwise it's pretty standard apart the fact that it's very simple
so maybe it's worse to uh to have more expense on that's that aspect
okay
so we can move to the is there any question for
designer of user interface or we can move to the next part maybe and discuss afterwards
okay
yeah
okay
yeah
yeah
okay

yeah
this is good also for
yeah i think it is good also f to have a spongy material yeah yeah because it's robust

yeah uh sorry
no
yeah
before
yeah
yeah
yeah i think it's innovative to use the mm the wheel because i think no one else has has it
yeah i think it's it makes it both easy and both innos innovative so i think it's a good aspect and it should be kept
cool fancy
we have to make it l look like a fruit or vegetable
maybe uh um a colour that remember some fruit uh things like that
maybe yeah
yeah and it's ergonomic as well
a pear
yeah maybe pear yeah or something like that
yeah we can discuss that uh d d is is there anything you want to add
i don't think so i think we we can have like yeah a pear is good fit well or banana as you told
something like that
but that's not in the trend the trend is spongy and vegetable fruits
i think p spongy is good because it it will be robust as well
so i think we can keep the wheel
because it's uh easy it's innovative even if the cost is a bit higher and
we also have to find a so a fruit like pear or banana wit uh
any others idea you have
what kind of fr fruit would you like to to control your t v  with
odi
banana is also yellow so you you can't lost your remote control then
i think it's a good idea yeah
yeah
yeah i think it's a good design and it's innovative as well then maybe we can keep the banana and it will be very easy to find
yeah
yeah it's really uh really a good point
i think it so
one second
so we have to take some decision on this aspect so uh so for
sorry for uh component so
we have to think about those aspects sorry
yeah
i think it's the box that should be spongy banana's shape

but
no the button would be in fact it it should be something odd shaped with a spongy cover
okay odd shape with spongy
cover and standard battery okay a chip imprint there's no specific problem so we agree to put the wheel
so it have to it has to be symmetrical

yeah maybe the thumb is more comfortable
yeah i think it's okay for both right and left mm
i think you can turn it this way also
you can do both with both hands
i think it's okay
well you you will get used to it and moreover th the button ar are lighted so you you immediately identify the right side because you have light on buttons
yeah
no you you i think you will use it only on the right or left hand whether you are righty or lefty
i think for lefty it's okay i can do this movement and for righty as well
i think this doesn't change that much
yeah
so for interface we said also that we have uh this banana shape with button on the s on the side
and
and uh a wheel on the top
so the colour is yellow
i think it's uh we defined everything according to
what we should what the decision we should take yeah
so maybe we can um
we can uh work on those aspects uh until next meeting so have the final uh look and feel design according to the decision
and have the the user interface design and uh then evaluate the prodyuc the product
that is to say uh check if it fit the the requirement
uh given by the users but according to uh your presentation it seems to be okay
it seems to be fancy innovative and easy to use
so
so
to prepare the prototype i would suggest that the industrial designer and the user interface designer uh work together that would uh
be better i think
and uh
and so uh
you will receive further instruction by emails as usual
so do you need to add anything
you feel okay
you feel uh free to express what you want to say you don't feel too constrained
you don't feel free to answer this
okay so
see you
uh i d  you want
yeah
i only v have three slides so i just look at the mm
um just this
on some web pages to find some documentation and i think a remote control is as i s mentioned previously
you just have a a very simple chip and the mm the user interface is just done usually by push button
and in our case we are using a um a wheel control
so uh uh i was looking basically for that chip which is uh very very standard and uh i just looked for the wheel sensor and the standard push button
and um yeah we can change directly in fact i have the number of
that element which is very standard for remote control the
push button are usually extremely cheap but i just have one problem and this is related with the wheel
sensor which seems to be quite expensive
and i think we if we could just talk about that if we really need a wheel sensor or if we can not if if we could combine something with the push button
uh a wheel sensor is fifty time the price of a a a push button
yeah
yeah i i th
but i don't think that uh we should
we should talk about uh the design of the box also which needs some money but
um that's all yeah i haven't chec
mm hmm yeah but i think it's yeah sorry i haven't written my personal references um the i i just want to mention the the problem of the the r
wheels sensor which is much more expensive than any push button and if we could reduce that
we we have already some good things uh with um um with the backlight of the push button
just to to make something which is uh slightly more design that uh a squarey box with a rubber
yeah actually
as soon as you thought to move the the remote control you have the light
yeah again
i don't think that this is really expensive but at the end this is plenty of unexpen eh very cheap devices but uh the bill starts to be
first of all i was thinking to have a a continuous light and you w when t you you you you press the on button you have the light on your remote control when you want to turn off your device
yeah a little bit
a little bit
yeah
yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
to s
mm hmm
i support an apple
yeah
yeah
yeah me too
ah it's okay i know that they do that for alarm clock also
yeah
mm hmm
what about um

and for maybe look and feel what about a a piece of ice
with blue l e d  inside
yeah
yeah

yeah
yep
yeah
banana i think it's a nice idea
because
but
you y you don't use the banana when the banana is curving like that but when the banana is curving like that with the wheel on the top and to control and here you have a a push button to
yeah
and everybody knows what is a banana basically if you if you start with uh fancy fruits and fra s and tha
oh yeah
so
so we will just use a a standard battery
and uh the chip we chip imprint we know exactly which one we are going to use uh what do you mean by case
yeah
uh i mean for me if we use a a spongy banana case doesn't matter i just want to have so something to prin to to fix my my components onto that box and that's it
yeah yeah yeah
spongy also
oh no i think it's possible
yeah
yeah this is uh like the
mm hmm
wheel on the top button where do we want some buttons
yeah
yep yep
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm

yeah

thank you
mm hmm
abdul al hasred is my name
mm hmm
yeah
mm
yeah
also have to say did you receive the email about the voice recognition
no
yeah you we uh an email from the manufacturing division that they have basically a voice recognition chip already developed
says
yeah it says that ri right now they just use it to uh to record uh answers to particular questions but i guess it could be
i guess it's possible i mean instead of recording the answers you can just uh record uh something simpler like a command
yeah you reco recognize commands and you can record new commands and stuff so if they already have it as uh as a chip
then we we could use it
okay
mm hmm
i have a question about that actually um what is the purpose of the light
is
but
but in th in the dark uh
yeah but is going to be always turned on the light
but if you move it then you have it you don't need to find it
you can see the buttons better of course yeah
but if you move it then you have to have some sensor to when you move it to detect your movement
yeah but you need another sensor for that right
yeah no it's too expensive

okay
mm
extra yeah okay
mm
yeah but i expected also the wheel would be cheap but you tell me that it is very expensive so yeah
mm
mm hmm
mm
okay so uh my one it uh should be in the shared folder
so
it was last time i saw it
okay
so just move to the next slide
so basically want very simple right that's the major idea as simple as possible
so i just look at some current designs uh on the web of usually more complicated remote
controls and let's look at two of them because uh th even though they have many buttons they look quite simple and
in our case we just uh reject the buttons what we don't need and it become even simpler
um so
yeah well this these uh these remotes are quite big so go to the next page so
we have all these buttons as you can see but most of them we just need the ones in the middle
so from the bottom or whatever is there uh the uh the numbers and then the top
uh until the ten also this middle part and on the left one is exactly the same so it's basically more or less how we
would like it with a big volume control big channel control and mute and power yeah these are the basic thing
so basically w software we will build will look more or less the same as these two
yeah if you have for example i think that the volume and the buttons that are there on the top are not very easy to reach with your thumb it could be on the right side for example yeah because we don't have these input buttons and this other stuff that they have
and i think that the plastic cover is not very good uh idea because
you open it it can break you ca you can do various things uh you just need to put the channel numbers somewhere a bit out of the way
so that they're separate a bit yeah uh and it's easy to press the other the big buttons but uh it's not that difficult to press the the channel buttons either
mm yeah i think that if you put the cover it will be even more difficult for the user
alright you won't yeah usually what i have noticed that people put the plastic cover on things that you normally don't mess with like buttons for t uh tuning the channels and stuff like that yeah that you want to protect a bit
and i think it's uh it's reasonable
so i don't think
yeah this is just the the wheel we could use the some wheels can be pushed down could use the push down of the wheel for the record if we want
uh so we could just basically use one just wheel and uh user could use just the wheel to do everything with the channels in that case
yeah i guess the market researcher will tell us all about that
mm hmm
well wou wou i think we can certainly just put the electronics in a spongy thing it it would work right yeah
you can throw it to the television
hey that's a cool one we could say that if you throw it you have a sensor and you throw it and hits the television and turns it off
when it d uh takes a shock
yeah
how do we make it look cool is the question
yeah

well the obvious thing is a banana i guess
the banana is also ergonomic
is there any fruit that is spongy
yeah
you can make it um
it's not hard the metal
plastic
mm
yeah
two of the button yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah so you can just have uh just have this curve yeah and you move uh your hand here to press the buttons and then you move uh on the other side so you can have it on on two sides and it'll be cool no
you can put also vibrator inside
ah ha you can also take into account the fact that the banana fits with the colour scheme of our company yeah
i hope the students of management die but anyway
now who are recording this meeting
the only th
yeah
y yeah that can be in inside th in the structure but uh the thing is that the buttons and
the wheel have to be i mean if it's spongy then the buttons and the wheel have to
i mean if it's spongy then it's going to move right so it's going to be bend a lot
so if we try to push the buttons it you think it's possible
okay
yeah
well usually hold 'kay we want it to be good also for the left hand users right
uh
yeah but okay sa let's say that th o it has to be basically you can only take two sides
one on ths this side where is the thumb and the other side where there is uh yeah also the thumb basically
or you could use use this one but i don't know if it's very comfortable to use this one for the wheel
this for the wheel and then this for the buttons should have the two sides
so if the left we have
the op
wheel wheel buttons yeah the problem is if you have buttons and wheel then when you turn it around the buttons are on the other side
so you cannot see them
yeah
so the buttons have to be here and the wheel has to be
y
yeah i know but uh if you hold with your left hand and the wheel is here and the buttons are here then when you turn it around the buttons will be on the other side
okay
okay maybe
yeah
yeah

mm hmm yes master
no
yeah
yeah
no
maybe you can make uh uh mm okay
okay i can go
can i
so now the recent investigation we we have done fo of the remote control um
so the most important aspect for remote controls is to be fancy look and feel
and not current functional look and feel and um the second aspect
is uh that the remote control should be uh technological innovative
and the third most important aspect is to to is that the co remote control should be easy to use
so are things we are we have uh speak about before yeah and um so you you can go
after
and there is a fashion watchers in paris and milan that have detected the following trends uh fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes shoes and furnitures
so maybe if our remote control have to be a fruit form or vegetable form something like that or
and the mm the material is expected to be spongy
uh i don't know which material can be spongy and if you
mm hmm
okay it's robust yeah

not good
an and and uh this uh you can yeah you can say that you ca uh you can
go uh before before yes and you know here the more iz important
aspect is the fancy look and feel after is uh technological innovative and after the
easy to use
yeah that's why yeah that's why i think we have to keep that if it's possible
innovative mm
yeah mm
oh colour yeah
oh i i
i thought about a a pear for example you know the pear is like that and it's it's easy to to have in in hand and uh
yeah

or a fruit like that i dunno






yeah
but you don't have
yeah





it's a inspired design
hmm


of course
so uh i noticed your talk about speech recognition and whistling and uh i was just curious to know have we done any research into how many people can whistle um or if is that a function we want in the remote
i don't but i i know a lot of people do right yeah it just i mean it has to be a certain kind of whistle too right
that's costly though um a much easier thing is just any loud noise like clapping um shouting you know uh and then what would the response be it beeps back at you or something
okay
well uh let me set this up
so i plug it in press f  five
function f  five
or function f  eight
okay
okay i think it's uh just to lock it in
it's got it
okay
um
so as the industrial designer my job is to take an input
from you guys um so it's good you went first and i jotted down some notes as to what are the
b needs and uh what kind of novel features we can add to differentiate our product from the others
um so raj told us that uh consumers are willing to spend
more for fancy products and um he also mentioned that uh
the current products don't always match users' operating behaviour um a lot of the buttons aren't used
and uh
he mentioned that they're not fun to use
and uh a novel feature which uh we just brought up was this this automatic speech recognition
feature or noise detection feature for when you lose the remote there could be a little microphone
on it and any noise over a certain threshold um it'll pick up as a a distress signal
um from you and it'll beep back and say you know oh here i am or something of this sort
oh yeah yeah that's true well maybe you could have a
um hmm tha that would be a consideration to take into account yes um
yeah well tha that's uh for later down the road um and then as for the user interface it should be trendy
um and not computery right so more low tech and not too many buttons
so i took these all into consideration and also i have some limitations from the boss
right um and practical limitations which i kinda threw out the window
and so i did a little research and unfortunately all i had to work on was our uh
our corporate archives of the great products we've made before which include you know um
space craft coffee makers and bullet trains
or uh or a high speed train right and having personally worked with all these products uh i have a great deal of experience with uh with industrial design of these
right so
i figured just put 'em all together
you got a a caffeine powered space shuttle train transport to your t v  and um
as for the user interface problem you know too many buttons give it one button
and and it's a you know for the the cowboy in all of us i i'm not quite sure what the the function is there but
yeah it's a g i mean you could have a you know a
right so i think i i missed the budget thing it was fifty million euros and we gotta sell twenty five of them right okay
oh okay so i i mixed those numbers
okay well i guess more realistically then we need a product that's got some kinda nifty outer casing cheap
plastic uh you know um that should be just like uh a tenth
of the price maybe or less an energy source which'd probably just be uh your regular batteries um
we don't wanna have it
uh
yeah yeah we could do that too um i hadn't thought of that yeah
right
right so so the unirs the user interface uh the canonical user interface for
these would be just a bunch of buttons but since we're a cutting edge company we uh of course will have
alternatives like uh speech recognition whistling recognition and rocket power
behind our product
um and lastly the transmission interface is uh just some engineering thing you don't have to worry about
um so here's you know a great schematic that my uh apprentice designer gave me
um as you can see the the remote control have parts and those parts look like that and um you know it's got a little operating procedure that looks something like that
and i suppose you all know how it works because we've all used it and we wouldn't be in a company designing
remote controls if we didn't know what they were so uh personal preferences i think
uh programmable options which um just require a small amount of memory uh non volatile
memory just um so the user can put in their favourite channels and maybe their preferred volume
settings so that when they turn it on it's not blasting
oh okay and the uh the bells and whistles that we mentioned you know they take more budgeting
um more technical uh expenditure of effort and it's also much more likely to
not work if if we add these bells and whistles

that's all i got

ooh that's tight
okay i don't think we need to screw it in just push it
yellow

yeah yeah
well hmm
oh it's
they're act there there was a remote control that came out two years ago that had a some basic speech recognition on it
you could programme it with your channels and then you say you know like uh b b c  one and it goes to that channel
yeah it didn't work very well though because of this noise interference problem they mentioned you know if the television says you are listening to
b b c  one
right right and so there was a lot of this you'd be watching the t v  and then all of a sudden it'd it'd pick up a noise and turn it off or you know or turn the volume off or something but if you can work around that that noise problem


right
right and then it would do just you know uh subtractive kind of cancellation of the noise what you could do
then would be you have uh a remote controlled by the t v  speaker or not a remo i'm sorry a microphone
by the t v  speaker and a transmitter there that sends back to your remote 'cause you can't um expect uh the the television manufacturers
to to put that feature into their t v s
but yeah then you have like the little se separate module by the t v  speaker
which
right and then the remote control would know um what's being produced by the television
right right
right right um yeah that's certainly possible then an another thing was about this losing the remote and trying to
find it again if you do have this sorta speech interface to it you don't even need to find it you just say you know
um whatever you whatever you want the remote for you know to change the channel or to uh turn the t v  on and off
you just shout your command to it and it would do it for you if it's within you know within hearing range
and uh you know it could be somewhere in the room y that you've no idea where it is and it would still do its job
well hopefully we're uh we're ahead of the curve
hmm
um
mm
yeah no th the material's cheap but it's just uh the the glow in the dark material needs some light to charge it you know and then uh if you're if you're sitting in the dark for too long it uh it won't glow any more
right
right
mm hmm
um yeah we're getting a lot of features now i i think
yeah
well i think a consideration too is that these uh remotes get abused a lot you know they get thrown around there's a good chance the the t f t  screen would break or uh get damaged they're pretty fragile
yeah mm
oh
oh no it's it's much cheaper than the t f t  it's just a microphone and some some integrated circuits
and it'd it'd be a small vocabulary speech recognition system like a



okay
yeah
yeah yeah

so it should be when you save
on your desktop so it goes save as or
and then uh hit that little folder up thing again
again
all the way to the top yeah that's up to desktop
right and then project documents

mm did you get my email
okay
just making sure
yeah
wow


we could go comp yeah we could go completely out of the box and make the thing a big red ball foam ball
and it's got the thing on the inside and there's no buttons at all it's always on and just yell at it and it works
and then ch children will love it
oh yellow yellow ball right
twelve thirty


mm
yep
yeah i've been using up the pages
another questionnaire
yeah yeah
um so how
s

sh do you want me to hold it

so after that
f  eight
f oh sorry f  eight
okay
yeah
yeah uh me again rajan the marketing expert uh as we have decided in the last meeting that i have to find out sorry yeah sure
yeah yeah uh actually sorry i have to see the other sorry
yeah thank you uh yes i have to look at the uh market potential
for this product uh like consumer likings and everything what is the potential for
this product and are we able to achieve our a net profit or our aims or not
then
sorry
okay yeah i can okay uh
then uh the methodology i adopted to find out all this was market survey
a a detailed market survey on consumers was done to find out their likings and dislikings what they prefer
what they not prefer w what problems they do encounter in all this type of things
and what we got was we found that if you uh
what they th what problems they are having with different uh remote controls available in the market
seventy five percent of users they do find it that the remote controls available in the market are ugly they are not so
good looking so we have to put stress on this uh we have to take care of this fact also like our design
uh should be appropriate should be good looking for the consumers
and yes that's wi uh this will definitely this can definitely put uh uh enhance our sales
uh and even uh the good thing about this is that eighty percent of users they are willing
to pay high uh pay more for this uh good looking remote controls also so even if the available
market goes for the available uh even if the market goes for the available remote control is
less even then we can sell it at twenty five euros which maybe which may seem quite high but if
our looks are are if the re remote control we design have a good better uh better look uh designs
then we can hope that consumers will prefer these g remote controls then
and the second thing some some companies they think that they should have more and more functions of
the users uh or in their remote controls but rather than those having more functions in the remote
controls we should emphasise what actually consumer want what they operate rather than making it too complicated
because mostly it has been found that fifty percent of the users they use only ten percent of the buttons so there
is no point of having ninety percent buttons making the remote controls too bulky too complicated too expensive
a because i think i believe that technology is useful only if uh the consumers they want
to use it otherwise there is no point of having all this type of things so this will not only
reduce the cost of our remote controls but it will increase our profit also so we have to take care
of this fact also
then
uh it was function i want to go to
uh escape okay thank you then if we look at this slide uh these are in your shared documents you can see like
uh sorry
ah t look all the market potential what uh how we should design consu our remote controls what they should
be there so as to en enhance our profit enhance our sales yeah these
are different age group persons like uh sorry i can open it in another
way
uh yes if we look at the costs whether the consumers they are willing to
uh pay more for speech recognition in a remote control or not we can find that they up
to a thirty five years age group we have a very good disliking for this uh this uh point
like for speech recognition in a remote control
so we can emphasise on this point also like because it will definitely enhance our sales in this
ag in this particular age group from uh fifteen to thirty five and i uh and i think that
most of the users of the rem uh t v  are belong to this age group so we should look
yeah we can look at that that factor also so yes
yeah so and

and then
yes
i think so uh if we look at this data how how uh h how what
are the problems the consumers are facing with the existing remote controls in the market they find that
thirt uh thirty five percent uh thirty four percent of the consumers they find too difficult to operate a remote control so
it should be in such a way that it should be easy to learn how to operate these remote controls and
we should provide pl uh spe uh proper manuals for its use also so as that people consumers
could easily learn
they need not to have any much technical knowledge to see uh to know how to operate these remote controls
so this is also a very goo uh major factor to loo uh take into consideration to enhance our profits
and sales so um this is all about
uh market potential by me uh yes th thank you
yeah we have to take that out sorry

sorry
uh sorry i have
brian this one also i yeah
thank you very much brian
if you want me to help yeah
yeah
uh f  eight function f  eight
mm s
it's not coming function f  eight okay
yeah
computer
computer adjusting yeah
yeah
escape
yeah

yeah
exactly yeah
yeah
yeah
hmm

fifty million was uh prof
as a profit
yeah me too
yeah
about cost
okay
uh
i
uh may i say something about uh actually i think it's really really very important point uh
as if we look at the market because people mor fifty percent people they find that the remote controls are often
lost somewhere in the remote in the room but yeah are lost and means they forget
where they have kept the remote control last time
but if we add speech recognition as well as glow in the dark then both these factors will help their locating
the remote control like if they come and speak something at the remote control uh
replies to something something and it glows in the dark both these factors uh both these points will help them to
locate the where they have kept this remote control and this will definitely enhance our uh market
sales so we should take it into consideration also
yeah
totally it takes cheap speech recognition she they wi

yeah
glow in dark
here sure
uh it is in shared documents
projoct uh projector
hmm it is not giving anything
shared documents
um but we have to take care like
but we have to take care of our children also if they means if children catch hold of your or if they chew it it shouldn't be too harmful so whatever material we use it should be yeah
so we have to safety point of view also we have to take care
yeah


small logo with the like a small yellow strip or y yellow with the logo in it
yeah
hmm

that's good


check here

um minutes from the last meeting which were essentially that we uh
had decided on roles for each of you however um there are some
changes that i've got from on high that um
are a bit uh well w what i didn't actually realise it was that the uh this
is for a specific television so the all in one idea goes out the window and
they require that the uh actually i'll get to that at the end
point number four um we'll get what you've got and then we can see what we can adapt from it
so um presentations were you anybody got raring
to go raring to go okay good stuff
mm
oh i need to plug you in
just about
uh there we go just screw 'em on in gonna have to swap them round so now it was function f  eight
that's the wee blue one
blue one f  eight
should do it good one
hold on sorry
and if you just click that it'll go ahead one at a time
sorry uh

p press f  five to start it first
jesus
excellent
oh you wanna go back just escape
okay
okay
okay speech recognition
hmm we're als we we're looking at who buys it as well
uh which i think the twenty five to thirty five is uh usual sort of

fifteen to twe

okay

okay thank you um follow on with helen yeah please oh so we do yeah fun and games
don't know if the cable's gonna be long enough i think i just kicked over whatever it runs on underneath as well
okay

function f  eight
hmm
there you go
uh f  five
um f  five and escape'll bring it back and just uh the left button for advancing

uh just a left uh
left mouse button
mm hmm
okay
'kay

that can come under arlo as well
uh
uh if you if you escape then you can see your bar
uh okay
'kay
mm hmm

we hope so


yeah particularly if we've uh there was a bit in raj's about r s i  and things as well
organic
mm hmm
sales
okay
yeah it's like a yeah

it's
right
and also the company want to keep it stuck to the t v  for uh to keep down the production time
mm hmm
yeah
okay
yeah
that's cool

um do you have trouble whistling really ooh
yeah i suppose that's true well i suppo uh you could y you could have the you could have the basically um instead of a whistle if it's got the voice recognition you could have it just you know where are you
hmm
sounds good
function f  eight for the um the uh
yeah

alright
let's remember that

mm hmm
but sure surely that would have to be um sort of specific rather than above a threshold 'cause if you had a loud movie on you're likely to get it beeping back at you
sorry i didn't mean to derail you there



ah is that what that is
well that's cool if you if you can build space craft you'll have no problem with a remote control yeah



right okay
is that just switches on the speech recognition and it's entirely speech operated is it yeah yeah
ah now it's fif fifty million euros we've gotta uh we've g gotta make profit so we're making that at twelve and a half euros a time
okay would it be possible to have the rechargeable idea is that is that gonna mark up a lot yeah
yeah yeah
i mean if you think about these base stations now it's essentially just a a lead with a sort of self connecting brake in it so i don't think it'd up up the price that much

okay
okay


right
yeah
'kay thank you very much um i'll take that back


right also so um a notice i got not very long before the meeting so didn't manage to forward it on to you it is let's see i'll find it myself um

ta nah
we had that um to dis include teletext
um because it's become outdated and everybody uses the internet anyway um dunno what oracle
would have to say with that but never mind um it's only for the television which i'm presuming means it's for a
specific television and um instead of colours and sorta
colour options they want corporate colour and slogan somehow implemented in the new design
yellow i presume um everything all their sort of uh you know the uh corporate website and everything's yellow
and the logo uh the sort of slogan we put the fa fashion in electronics uh
i don't know exactly how sort of incorpor i mean i guess if you're going for a sort of globular shape you could kind of have it working its way round it or something
uh where am i

okay so we have to decide on which functions we're going to actually have
uh now we had as listed options we had
speech recognition potentially flat screen interface l c d  interface um
we also want to limit the number of buttons so we'll pretty much take that one as read we'll use the the basic functions for a television no teletext um okay hold on
not enough buttons you mean so sorta strike a balance between a a few and a or it looks like we're just cutting on the um
i do however have this from over my head that they don't want teletext on it
uh maybe raj you could find out what people would think about that or maybe they'll send
some information about that about um what people whether people would require um teletext
in a remote teletext option in a remote control
okay um so uh i take it your
position arlo is that the bells and whistles we've gotta come up with the a gimmick but not
too complicated a gimmick um so i mean a a the sort
of inkling i'm getting from little bits of um web chatter that i'm getting sent is that they're quite interested in a
t f t  display interactive display however that does sound a bit like the
more complicated design that rav uh sorry raj um

said people didn't like although i guess if there's a sort of if you think about standard interfaces that people
use already sort of windows style drop down menus or whatever i think maybe that's a bit going a bit
far but you know like in a basic sense that you could have your basic selection of buttons
and if you hit a sort of menu at the top you have
um it goes to a different selection of buttons so it sorta keeps it simple um glow in the dark is that sort of with a light inside it or is it sort of glow in the dark material
okay so
yeah
yeah
lost yeah
that's cool
that's cool
okay cool um
speech recognition i take it
i don't i've i know of no products um that use speech recognition well
really
mm hmm
yeah or a yeah an advert an advert for b b c  two on b b c  one'll switch the channel for you kinda thing

mm
uh huh
ah that's a good idea
so like a kind of backwards remote from the telly
right
that we should just stick on yeah
yeah
and that's a sort of basic r f  kind of frequency so it'll be cheap
uh huh
yeah it might do us out of a job um
okay i
like the whole sort of remote feedback thing um
so i think rather than and that also kind of takes out the speech recognition
in terms of the interference of it not working very well and things like that so i th yeah and expense and the time
so i think if we're going to go well i mean like the thing about the there's the problem with the t f t 
or the l c d  kind of thing is if you're also wanting the the kind of
uh organic globby sort of feeling to it then
you might have trouble incorporating the screen
um but i guess not i thin we'll just we'll just pretend that's not a problem um uh and how are you about the glow in the dark material is that
contrast contra well
yeah okay
so if it's dow it's d uh yeah or if it's down under the couch cushions um which is where i usually find mine um
okay well we can use we can still use the glow in the dark as a gimmick essentially um if we're gonna have to if we're gonna have the logo on as well bright yellow logo in our our um
slogan uh then you know they're gonna be fairly brightly coloured anyway and we can have sort of a a a trimming as well of the glow in the dark material just as gimmickyness
mm hmm
alright so n sorta if if if we're gon if we're gonna go with the idea of um uh of feedback sort of remote finder then that kinda stuffs that one out then
do you think
uh it makes it fairly unnecessary then okay um okay so scratch
that uh so we've got do we want to go with the t f t  idea or the
is that far too expensive well i mean i think i think the sort of find the finder things
i mean it's uh i could probably write the circuit diagram for that myself um
mm hmm
okay
um no i mean that was going on ravs uh raj's sort of um marketing research i guess um
uh
so we'll stick with sort of programmability um for the buttons that we do have
um
so that's sort of
included in your sub module kind of stuff um

uh you were finding out about teletext if you could find out that uh
um i think we're gonna scratch the speech recognition as a bit of a
um expensive no
oh right okay
is it not the circuits that cost
oh right okay uh well that kind of takes back the r f  the r f  remote sort of idea as well um
five minutes okay decisions uh votes let's vote who wants t f t 
no one does excellent so we'll go with speech recognition yeah um speech recognition limited buttons organic design
and what else was i thinking of that i haven't written down and therefore fallen out my head programmability
uh
uh o okay and also integrating the remember to integrate the logo and the s slogan
okay so um can you put all these reports in the project documents
folder if they're not already in there as well so it just helps me summarize them and
um i'll put any i'm i'm putting anything i do in there anyway so uh
uh pro uh project documents
on
a m i  scenario controller
where am i project documents yeah it's on your desktop as well

and i will tr getting strings of um information i'll try and forward any
specific to anybody in particular as soon as i get them now rather than i was about to sort of tell you about the changes
before the meeting and then the meeting turned up so

i did


so
okay
yeah
more sort of um
flesh like than plasticky sort of

oh no ethics that's gonna cost us money

okay safety
yeah
it sme smells good for children

that sounds yeah it's gonna have to be it's gonna be have a big yellow foam ball yeah sorry
please god no um well i wouldn't th i mean my reaction to an all yellow remote control wouldn't be anything other than horror so i think just having it
surrounding the logo
yeah
and i'll see if i can argue with boss about putting the what was it we put we put fashion into
whoops it's not working
can't believe i've forgotten it we put the fashion in electronics i bet that'll catch on well okay any last
worries queries
okay s s i know what you're thinking okay then lunchtime yay
okay that felt a bit more like a something with order and and reason to it than the last one
this is quite fun actually
i really don't
yeah yeah wow you've your first page i was just writing really big
i've finished the meeting now
oh everybody needs k questionnaire

okay
okay
mm hmm
wow

so sorry i was just gonna say what was the question for this or is are you coming on to that
okay
so these percentages are are what
hmm
mm mm
mm hmm
mm hmm
yep sure that's cool um
yeah
i can turn my computer quickly if that's okay
um yep
okay and then what do i press f  eight
oh right
okay cool
oh
yeah no signal

okay cool
okay and then how do i press the the big one to get it on to the big
f  five and i press that again to get it off as well do i
okay so um i'm the interface design designer user interface designer sorry
uh i'm concerned with um w what effect the apparatus
should have on the user and um i'm i'm also i want
to point out that our motto put the fashion in electronics so obviously we as
a company we want to make our products trendy and fashionable it's a big concern of ours okay and how do i
press n just the next button the arrow
okay so um i looked at existing designs and also um the information
that raj gave us was very useful about what people like what people dislike um and
what people fashionable because we said people between twenty five and thirty five were the main
um buyers of of our t v  i think so um what they like
and what they find fashionable and ergonomics we said um i don't know i haven't actually
been able to do any of this myself but um maybe that comes up i don't know
and the findings well
the basic that was the basic function to send messages to the television set that's what people want to do
um so they need to be included um but i've got some pictures here
of some leading ones i don't know how to get to them do i press f  five is it escape
oh okay cool i haven't got my glasses on so i hope it's this one these are two leading
um remote controls at the moment you know they're grey they've i mean this one's got loads of buttons
it's hard to tell from here what they actually do and they don't look very exciting at all
um personally i prefer this one just because it's looks easier use it's a bit more
sleek with more of this silver stuff um but there you go that's what
we're up against and i think we can do much better than that
um
hang on
f  five okay sorry
personal preferences um well i think we need to l i think the ergonomics is quite um important um
uh huh and um i thought not too edgy and like a box more kind of
hand held more um not as uh computery and
or organic yeah more organic shape i think um simple designs like the last one we just saw not
too many buttons and as raj pointed out only ten percent fifty percent of people only use ten
percent of the buttons so i think what we can miss out on the buttons we can make up for in
design and and how nice it looks
um hand held and portable i think is portamint is important because t f t  have just
um released um i think is it a a remote control for presentations
or uh and a big seven inch big screen anyway so um
yeah no seven inches isn't that big but um anyway um so hand held and portable and uh m i thought about other functions for t v  but as you pointed out people don't actually want that so maybe we forget about that
it's for one t v  oh right okay sure and so the last thing i thought w which i quickly mentioned
in the other one was maybe a bit of a gimmick to set us apart from other people like glow in the dark
um which does already e exist but it's not very widely used i don't think
easy finder with the a whistle function or something or rechargeable station because it's a pain
when you run out of batteries and i think that yep that's it okay
mm hmm

um i haven't been able to
mm hmm yeah or some sort of voice
yeah
mm hmm
yeah something

oh you need to twiddle the thingamibobsy thing
okay


mm hmm
mm hmm

mm hmm



yeah sure


well i like that design


yeah not a problem


mm hmm
or a little base station or something
that might cost more though 'cause obviously with batteries we don't need to provide well we provide the first batteries but it's more it's that's cheaper to just provide batteries
a battery in it kinda
okay
okay


mm
mm that's a good idea actually i like the programmable options

mm 'kay
mm hmm
okay
corporate colour
okay
mm hmm
yeah
okay
'kay
mm hmm
mm hmm
although the the danger with that is it could look a bit cheap
yeah well
mm
on the number of buttons kind of functions and stuff
mm hmm okay
okay cool
mm hmm mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah
yeah
okay
um
glow in the dark material i was thinking um so i i guess that would be cheaper than a light i think
often lost s was that yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm mm hmm

mm

mm hmm
'kay
well what about this might get a bit too expensive actually but what about um something that's built
into the t v  um that you can press and it'll send out a little signal you know like the ones
that we can't hear or something um that that will activate
the remote control starts to beep if you find if y
yeah
mm yeah that's the only thing yeah
that comes with our remote control yeah
mm hmm
that could also be built into the t v  though which might make our remote control a bit obsolete
yeah okay
mm
and the expense
mm hmm
mm
maybe not even all of it 'cause we said um colours and fashion w were important so maybe um just like a little l line that's kind of around the outside and then you can make the rest a different colour
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah 'cause what i thought main
slogan yeah
right
mm hmm
'cause yeah that w more than finding it that was more like you know if you're watching a film in the dark you can um still see the remote control
that was more of a a gimmick
mm
yeah unnecessary yeah
mm
so is that one of our definite requirements that they wa that it needs a t f t  screen
yeah you think so
okay
mm hmm that's cool
um
if it's not too expensive s i think it's a good gimmick
mm hmm
and where is it sorry
oh
okay cool
okay
okay
what i thought as well about the material is um maybe not this kind of material but maybe more
like um this kind of rubbery material it's a bit more bouncy like you said they get chucked around a lot
um a bit more durable and that can also be ergonomic and
it kind of feels a bit different from all the other remote controls the rubber rather than
mm hmm mm hmm


oh i think wi with the more organic shape of it it won't be as it won't as have many sharp corners as that so that's something good um
i dunno i mean

that's a good idea interesting
yeah d with the colour um does it have to be all yellow do you know
no
yeah
having a little bit okay cool
mm mm
mm hmm okay
cool
oh yeah that's a good one that yeah so

wow has anybo oh has anybody pressed okay it vibrates it's pretty cool
yeah got small writing
i don't wanna waste it
wouldn't wanna be project manager uh what we going to do um once again i'm uh gonna take minutes so um no presentation for me uh first we have a prototype presentation by g  and g 
afterwards some uh
eval eval evalu evaluation s sorry uh
evaluation crit criteria uh in combination with the finance i um
uh i received uh a an uh an excel uh file
which we have to fill in later on um you see uh and then
we must see uh if we uh stay under the twelve and a half euro so that's uh
that's a big l so let's uh wait it uh um we have we have must uh we must have uh
some time for that uh because it will be uh yeah quite a lot of mathematics
and after that uh uh an evaluation of uh the process how we uh
how we have done it here with the smartboard with the with our laptops with the all uh all this
and uh afterwards uh we closing once again forty minutes so uh let's start i would g give the word to
um g  and g  for the prototype presentation
j  and j 








mm
no okay
it's called a weemote
weemote


yeah i can imagine that
yeah but uh you d you mustn't forget that uh our target aim is
younger people uh we had decided to uh put uh some flashy fruity colours in it
uh and uh in the survey from uh milan and paris uh
it uh it came out that uh uh the d the older people are uh
more willing to uh to spend money on extra features so
i think uh it will be a better idea to have some uh flashy fruity colours as as a standard
and for the people who uh really want uh a more sophisticated more traditional look they're willing
to pay uh that they want uh they want more luxury stuff but they have the money
to do it and they want to b to buy that so maybe it's an idea to put that as an extra and not as a standard
yeah
yeah

yeah
yeah but the mai i think th uh the standard must be some kind of uh uh attractive flashy colours not too but w a little because that's our aim yeah
well the buttons don't have to be uh all uh all of yeah
it
yeah
okay
thank you
the marketing expert

sorry
okay so we gon we gonna evaluate the
yeah the the thing we saw okay just saw
yeah seven
uh true sorry
yeah one i think
yeah
okay
okay


yeah

yeah
yep
yes
no teletext buttons teletext is in the menu
volume is true

yeah big and clear

oh okay well i agree
i was thinking very black and white
thank you j 

fruity
yeah well we p we can do it glow in the dark so if it's in the dark place you still see it glowing
i think ah you must see it as
uh w uh according to uh the the other uh remote controls there may uh uh be there in your uh t v  room this one will stand out i think
exa i think that that's what it's about
if it if this lying on your couch you're you're you think what's that for kinda orange uh thing so
yeah

okay
that's our remote control
true

yeah but not too soft we have decided
three yeah
easy to use one
yeah can it be zero
yeah

okay two yeah two
what's the time we also have uh to do the evaluation uh the production costs and uh stuff

yeah
you're agree tim
you haven't seen a more innovative uh thing in uh paris

false

yeah but they are built in so it's one
okay
freak
okay thank you

we'll see
mm
okay we have now to c uh to calculate the production cost if it's under uh
twelve and half euro then it's uh ok uh okay but i is it
if it is b huh no this isn't right okay so redesign oh
yeah if they under yeah
no
oh yeah yeah it's sorry yeah if the costs are under twelve and a half euro uh then
we uh can uh ra uh move on to the project evaluation as we have
uh experienced it otherwise we have uh do uh have to do a little uh redesign uh thingy so
uh we have to fill in the numbers of the component uh components we have to uh fil uh
want to uh do it in and uh see uh if we stay under the twelve and
a half euro so do we have uh a hand dynamo no
that's zero
battery one okay
kinetic one okay solar cells zero okay uh simple chip on print no
no advanced chip sample sensor sample speaker
three
yeah uh but it it's one one thing it's three euro uh what's the sample sensor
okay
zero uh uncurved flat no but is it s it's not
made from a single uncurved thingy and then uh and then uh no okay
so it's only uh once double curved
okay we're now in a problem 'cause uh we have uh reached eleven euro yet
okay but uh we have
okay
uh rubber
you
titanium no
special colour
yeah but we want to make uh the wood colours uh that uh
yeah one
yeah but we we going to yeah yeah that's true but yeah it's it's it
okay the push button no
scroll wheel no
no oh no yes one uh button no
no the the we don't have a s no okay oh okay so
um what's the thing we can change
uh can i uh i say something no can i say something uh as project manager the kinetic thing can we just skip it because uh you have to shake it but that's not really innovative
yeah yo sorry yeah yes
yeah
mm hmm
okay
yeah and not really but we if you forget about the kinetic well if we do that
we shall
so um
uh b but i but the single curved is just oh
oh okay okay so that's wh tha that's one option
and then w yeah and then we could have it but uh it's its' well it's it's r it is the main point of the the the the look
no tho uh that that can be done so uh
okay a little less uh conversation
sorry
fill in just a
explanation i can delete it for you if you want
so if we do this uh we're on uh twelve and a half euro and we're done
uh well the only uh thing that don't
yeah single curved but there's a curve in it so
yeah it's really a static value yeah
yeah it is oh
yeah okay
yeah do you think well now you can shake your remote control
kinetic
yeah
who because if you want to go to kinetic you're uh you're on thirteen and a half and you must go to flat and i think now it's it's more of uh a compromise
thing
and if you make the single curve ha just a big curve
then it's uh then it's uh yeah one big good curve i was going to uh say nasty words but i don't this is strange by the way
wood is m is is is cheaper than rubber we thought that wood would be more expensive
yeah maybe but uh that this is this is it yeah okay this is it i'm gonna save it
yeah
okay well
considering we have

well we were above so we did a little redesign
okay um now uh it's about time to uh talk about uh this
project uh some uh things were there uh room for uh was there room for creativity
in our meetings or in your individual meetings
yeah
yeah
yeah yeah yeah that's true i agree with that
yeah that's true
yeah yeah that's true
yeah
okay uh how about the leadership

okay thank you very much now we're done
yeah that's true

yeah
yeah
yeah i notice it too i was a i was also very uh unhappy uh very unsatisfied uh about the
about the first meeting so uh i hope uh uh the the the other meetings uh
get better and uh i think the the last two meetings uh also we we reached uh some good decisions about uh talk yeah
okay so uh that's cool uh teamwork well maybe that's uh only yeah well it's for us because uh
yeah
yeah and it's wo more like presentation and some points were discussed but really teamwork were you two uh
the
yeah
no hard feelings

yeah now you you must push a little while
okay
o just uh okay
you can be you can go quicker 'cause then it it won't notice it
i follow the master class for the smartboard so i think that's the that's the main issue um
so uh about this one you were uh you're dealing with
um the the the the digital pen
okay yeah
yeah
no
huh
well
yeah
m yeah
yeah
and it is still your own handwriting uh popping up in uh word
no uh that's true no
and uh the smartboard is uh useful but the the pen is i uh not user friendly i think be it it takes a lot of time to draw things and to write things and that's the
yeah but that's not th the the you when you at a foreign audience you b don't gonna wr uh write uh small
yeah
but maybe there's some function with no it isn't with uh
yeah
well i'm gonna erase my uh name
yeah it's a big uh big eraser
um
well the the idea of the touch screen is uh

i'm just uh
i don't know what what i mean
no
oh
oh yeah
that's interesting
okay because what does it mean
all the mo yeah are between one and two
yeah oh okay yeah okay thank you expert but the new ideas found for uh wi with working with this uh software
not really yeah
yeah i think
yeah
yeah
you had expected it to to be uh more more uh
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yep yep
yeah that's true
yeah and and maybe some uh functions for uh uh uh circle or uh a square you have to draw it yourself now
yeah
yeah
yeah that that can be done already but not the the the the predefined uh squares i think uh
hmm
sorry
well that's nice
is it
here oh
oh sorry select
yeah here that
so you have as you saw you have a little uh
oh you can
yeah thank you
you can go uh
there
so there the the the functionality is there but it's not it's not ideal and it's it's very it costs a lot of time to uh
to use and that's a pity if you uh if you have uh thirty forty minutes uh for this kind of things and we are now with four people but it well imagine you are here you're with the ten people and everyone uh
yeah two minutes of drawing yeah
yeah
yeah

yeah yeah
yeah just like he said with the with the a screen which you can write also uh a kind of voting uh mechanism
yeah
yeah


yeah okay so
uh well just about because uh
yeah tomorrow uh the costs are within the budget uh the project is evaluated
but before we going to celebrate uh i have uh a little question which you can't answer because
uh there must be some kind of end report i am busy with the end report right now you might thinking
what the hell was he doing uh
uh about all the meetings what we have decided a r r a report of this day uh that must be made but i don't know here is uh standing uh whoa we can celebrate now but the end report is
okay well that uh that can be done maybe we can do it uh together you can see what i've uh yeah so i i s i will uh put it on a story board
you can see it
because i think it will uh it must be uh
yeah it's a three uh with seventy five uh
yeah just about well just a moment end report
no no no i'm just uh you can s you can read it and uh here here it is end report
well this not nit it read only but it's not uh fully finished yet
um this is about the functional design the things yeah yeah oh yeah i'm uh when i said it i remember i had it here
marketing expert okay um
about the three functions where uh which are most used and uh which must uh immediately be visible
on our uh remote control um it must be uh simple to use very clear what to do
and at the younger people so this is really about wh uh what kind things uh must be in it and uh
yeah
yeah i understand you i can talk a little bit dutch
oka okay okay i
i really didn't knew that
so this one's first
you go there and you go there so okay well maybe i can then do it one two three
if the order is in uh is is uh important that's the word for uh
then the conceptual design uh well all the things we have uh discussed uh the energy which uh turn out to be uh batteries so that's
yeah because yeah uh he here it is still double curve the rubber the flashy the fruity the removable uh the buttons hmm
not double anymore nay but that this is what um
yeah
and the the added functions like tetris snake it's under the parental control the touch screen so it's uh just a summary of what uh we had discussed uh
uh it's very cheap you you maybe you you you you come at uh
it's very necessary
yeah but it still has some yeah okay but so we can discuss that uh
we can discuss that kind of things i think with the
with the the board of uh
what's it what's the company called i just keep forgetting it
real real reaction
real reaction yeah okay so uh anybody uh misses something here about uh
yeah okay that's that's what i'm gonna write b between now but i in here nothing uh
mm hmm yes
yeah touch screen i've mentioned
yeah okay well i gonna redesign uh something now no
because i think it will oh five minutes from to finish meeting

oh that's cool tim
finish meeting now well i'm i'm
i'm going to finish my end report
i am the one who can say that yeah hereby the meeting is finished yeah

yo
evaluation criteria

oops
some creative uh
oh yeah
ok okay
shall i give a short introduction and then uh
okay
j  and j  okay
take it away
um this was our first concept we decided to use a single touch screen so we've
worked out this concepts how to how to hold it where to put the buttons and and stuff and um
well we began with uh with a form of shape that is uh is easy to hold w in one hand left or right handed
so we made i it a little bit less thick and uh it has some ar artistic meaning
no this uh isn't nothing
idea maybe uh is better
um well during the meeting i showed you the concept of uh placing the buttons on top usable with your thumb
and uh the menu structure uh if necessary with your other hand so it's just gonna hold it easily and
it has to be acce accessible with your uh other hand too of course
so we began uh working out a concept
yeah the panel just uh of course goes like this
but the overlaying layer is uh a little bit uh curved and stuff
yeah
yeah oh we added that this um can be held with your hands for this maximum is om yeah one and
a half centimetres so you have room here for your battery and maybe even other um electronic chips
s and you can just be the the layer of the touchscreen and some have some wires
underneath it to make it as uh thin as possible in the middle for good grip
yeah
yeah

yeah

yeah it would be best to to appeal to a broad public and make the covers exchangeable so
the young people will buy an orange and a red and blue and a purple but when the o older
people uh go in the shop and they see uh an orange um remote control it
would be less appealing than a white one and young people we think are a little bit more flexible they think ah i'll buy for a
couple of euros some noi nice hip uh
well
um i think a cover is necessary 'cause als otherwise you'll just have the l c d  screen so there must be some cheap standard cover um maybe white or something that's could comes with it and you can buy so we can make extra money
okay
the other way around you mean
uh huh
mm hmm
okay
okay yeah
well yeah a colour of a wood style a white c and uh a couple of h hip uh fruity colours
and lea uh l delivered standard with a fruity colour but not too not too much this
is banana and mango not not purple or p orange and yellow
ah mm hmm
yeah
yeah okay no yeah
okay
okay
it's my turn




mm
yeah
no no a little more in the middle no uh three or yeah
yeah it will be primary appealing to to m minus forty but also appealing to
yeah it's wow
yeah it's the marketing uh angle on television we have a wonderful
yeah
well it's also fancy then
yeah of course we have a perfect remote
yes
yeah yeah oh they have to agree but
i'm the user interface uh expert
um uh no you you've different menu
and volume is impo yeah
yeah yeah big and clear but you could make a teletext button uh six otherwise the people who read this uh are gonna think we have no teletext button
no yeah
black and red
okay don't forget to save it uh
uh well when we put in fancy colours yeah and yeah
but um it it's not making any sound uh have we deciding so
it'll make a difference we have the better re i don't know yeah i think so my remote control's black
a little bit but yeah
uh
k yeah fo fo yeah fo five is
yeah okay you're right
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah if your uh fifteen remotes in a drawer uh you find it yeah
yeah that's stupid
uh but when you lost it you're just not
yeah mostly when you lose your remote control it it's under your
most of times when you lose it you're sitting on it uh
um i would call uh choose two 'cause we decided not to make two f uh fresh colours as it would not
um
kinda soft but but not this yeah
yeah
yeah yeah easy to use very afford
no you can do two because um it can be easier but then you're l yeah but then you'll lose function f yeah functionality and our fancy uh look so
but
it is r it is rather easy to use because you have the primary buttons always visible

no
yeah m mine too
yeah but waits just a minutes inspiration
these are the m regular remotes
yes true one
yes one
very multifunctional
no
this is used with speech recognition this
yes
but uh maybe make it two because the games are in a sub menu and not uh it's not an entire game
yeah okay
yes
th did you make this or the
yeah
it changes it maybe
oh yay
oh dear
hmm
if they're under twelve fifty
yeah cau 'cause so it's okay
battery yes one one yeah
kinetic one yeah

no
no the advanced chip is uh
yeah
yeah you give it a sample uh one
no
you no
yeah 'cause um the layer around it fits around the bubbles on the o on the uh the back of the
uh we don't have anything else so
could you step a little to the right ma yeah oh sorry
or
and zero
special uh is the special colour mm
yeah yeah if if you're honest we'll uh type one special colour
yeah
uh j maybe we'll finish uh the the list first and then look back aye
no scroll wheel no
no
one yeah
no mm is it no no
so
no no
mm single curves
yeah
just cut off the kine yeah or yeah
yeah we just put a good battery it it mobile phones nowadays
but you can use rechargeable batteries anyway just you s you have to recharge them manual
yeah that's a cost reduc
ah
yeah so we have to bake the ba back flat and then
no it's it's just one curve and not a back uh curved i think or
or are these two curves uh
yeah but what else uh do we have to cut out no advanced chip uh that's a little bit of problem
although can we make it with a regular chip
curvy
explanation twelve fifty well
yeah but does it fit with our design do we have to u adapt it
it's single curves
w
could we just make the bubbles uh cut off the back and then we're uh has
okay
more yeah you make it optional
functional
uh there's an a a athe aesthetic value but not functionality
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah but it doesn't fit in our co cost profile so
you ma can make an an especialised extra gold version
yeah
yeah just one big curve
uh this uh american figures you just cut down some trees
whoever makes uh a remote control out of titanium
yes
no

we sue we yeah we'll start her all o all over again
um
for us there was a lot of creativity we could just sign up an uh remote if we liked
uh
crappy cra
yeah
yeah example of crappy leadershi
okay yeah
you could of said shut up you fool
yeah more more consensus ev everybody w was agreeing every yeah
well we work together on a project but everybody has his own task so it is a little bit
yeah no
well it went okay
stupid stupid pen but uh
yeah but but draw something uh difficult d uh just write your name right now try to write your name in in writing letters of course yeah
yeah normally uh this uh the w block letter sign it yeah
just just write your name in in one line if it's a little bit too small bit quicker now it didn't
uh he he knows how it works yeah

y well yeah th the i
the idea is great but it doesn't work properly uh
yeah
nee as uh as i said a m a c few moments ago it i would like myself to write with a normal pen because must um
yeah it's almost the same concept but you can just sim more simply put it on our scanner i it's the same concept as the pen where you f have to download the software or s uh very uh slow
yes no and it doesn't give any added value
yeah not user friendly
yeah and it's it's not very precise we're trying to m to
yeah it may um yeah and tr try to wri write your name uh in a in a normal uh size yeah smaller
yeah smaller just like when you're writing on a letter
no a as you saw on on this drawing just open open this one or that one
it's uh th it it yeah uh we had more problems even here when we trying to draw these buttons it's almost impossible to get clear uh when you're uh
and the eraser was another problem it w t is is this large and when you try to erase this line y
i'm gonna erase my name there
m abo what kind of new ideas
yeah uh
new ideas about uh the working of this software about about the project about the remote controls or
hello
yeah
so true
not really just they have to improve it uh the concept is okay but it has to be quicker
uh it is still opening my programme n almo almost uh my entire computer is locked up during
the process and it yeah just takes too many time people will still feel the need to to write it quickly
on uh a page and not download it and save it and
more user friendly 'cause when you use a pen you can just draw like you d draw normally and you do
yeah
yeah that l
would be easier or at least when you you don't have to adapt to the technology just
you can write in the way you normally write and now you have to um keep constantly in mind that you're
drawing on this screen and that's a very bad concept
nah okay i i it's my opinion that i
yeah it's can be saved easier
but if you're in normal flip over you a lot of people write text there's no text option and writing text uh yeah you've gotta really do your best to write some
yeah
or maybe even insert picture if you have uh some presentation and you have some f
yeah
'cause then you could
oh okay
so you can
with uh w w  dot google dot com
oh yeah maybe
you'll just make a link in
yeah
there's one way to uh
maybe if if you're not using the eraser
something else th yeah arrow
okay well it's
yeah okay
but
to use yeah
yeah and that's m

that's mostly the case from the over here with the managements you get two minutes to make your case and if you have to do all this kind
you'll rather use powerpoint and work it out in advance and th the one or two things you have to draw when you're there just use a flip board
yeah
okay yo manager when are w
when are we going to produce it
oh
a chairman
yes
it's a read only version
oh okay
uh

one two three
yeah well okay maybe you can add it later that we decided in the end because of the cost
a single curved
ah it's very cheap

yeah
he'll do it in his free time so uh
of directur or directors
yeah
you can ask your personal
yeah the end conclusion but uh
um the decision to make um the buttons on the top and the menu on the
on the bottom and clearly yeah touch screen you've mentioned
okay
okay this n yeah
party party
oh before you change anything maybe you um save it first
you can't you can select file and export and then those j  peg files
well eight and we have uh another blank one
did we change anything
wow
yeah
it's a new uh commercial logo
don't save it aye
uh
why are only the first five smartboard files
saved


evaluation

mm hmm that's gonna be t problem
yeah well sure
hi

yeah uh well and as you saw we would just have the basic remote with the panel l c d 
uh screen well these would be the main buttons h you could uh change them later on in your own profile if you want to but
well it's standard they will be delivered with this kind of uh set up we have the more advanced menu
uh setting right here we have the sub menus and stu stuff we made a top oh or a front
view just so like you wanna uh back view as you can see this uh there there are uh
two uh weird bumps in it this is for uh the added uh effect of uh
well uh y youth and dynamic and uh this is for the artistic effect well what we figured is
uh we'll show you a picture later on you have more b a better idea after that but idea is
for to stay in balance with these two uh with these two and so when you put it on the table it will just
lay down it won't uh roll around or stuff but it will lie more in your hand like an old telephone
maybe or like these old uh phones y you you may get the idea so thi this is about uh
how we figured it should be the s panel we g you would hide with some more uh rubber
layers like we discussed early on uh you would s you wouldn't see the uh straight panel but more
fluidly and round
yeah
and uh in these bumps you could actually uh put some electronics uh that would you can make a more thinner uh design and that would actually look very nice yeah and uh about the colour what have

yeah f uh as colours do you do you have the picture in uh
oh yeah now well this is the idea about uh the bumps uh you can see there's a v a very uh youthful uh dynamic uh exterior it uh you just want to hold it you uh you are young and uh dynamic like us
yeah it's like an e but this is for children we we want a more adult version but this is like a remote control for children
a weemote yeah hey that's actually a brilliant uh marketing stand uh
but so this actually basic the idea we we just want to build a more
uh adult vers adult version of of this
and and for colours we we figured starting with basic colours like uh white or metallic grey those are the technological colours actually so it d
or blue or whatever
oh yeah
yeah
yeah yeah maybe yeah perhaps you're right uh i i would i would actually agree with this sounds logical
nah yeah
yeah li like like this like this this isn't this isn't too much is it
i f
yeah the buttons i
yeah uh something like this would be nice okay that's that's it from us

uh oh


why yeah it's not just uh designed for people under the age of forty it's also designed for people above forty
so
i have i've yeah two or three because it's not just uh the qu question is aimed at is it designed for people with age below forty but it's also designed for people of age above forty so
i'll say it's about three


yeah i i think
yeah

yes
yes
yeah leads to user face yeah
yeah false
uh hmm
yeah the they are big and clear
yeah but but the teletext button yeah you can ch that's in a menu so it's w yeah it it it it isn't entirely unclear but so i wouldn't give it a seven i would give it a more a five or a six
uh i don i don't know what do you think uh mister project manager
hmm
yeah



yeah it has these all these fruity colours and it has a strange shape so if you so if you have trouble finding it
well then uh then i'll go for four because uh four is between three and uh uh also between between true and false uh
so i'll i'll go for four
wha

yeah that that's a better question actually

well if i if you see a strange shape lying somewhere uh then you'd uh recognise it as whoa that is strange yeah yeah what is that uh
so it's

yeah
yeah rubber is kind of soft
well i don yeah it is kind of
it
no uh
it could yeah
functional ability
no it's it i i'll go for two my vote's on two
yes

yes it
yeah they are built in
not down
you really like the parental advisory
bu
yeah he made it

no
me too
yes yeah
yeah yeah
yeah
uh n no
no
yes
no
uh we have one we have one
no sev zero
well that's um yeah speech recognition and s
a zero
no no
yeah


just go on then we'll see uh we'll we'll see uh wha how much we are over budget
zero
i don't think so no this is a standard colour yes this is a special colour
that's an add on
no
these three
well we're only four euro over budget but
well other case we can make it single curved or uncurved
yeah okay sure
yeah sure
okay well you you can go from double curved to single curved
and that would solve the budget problem
yeah
it's just yeah well the single curve that
yeah exactly yeah

we going to cut


yeah we just make it flat but you do l
function
worth does it have added worth no um
yeah well let's assume it is we we should assume it i that it is but i i figured that the kinetic would
be a marketing promotion r if you uh promote a kinetic um
i kinetic remote control i mean that would b sell better than an a normal remote control
no well y i mean uh y you can go into your neighbour and tell him ha my k uh remote control is kinetic you have standard old battery control uh remote con

true


it is possible but you can't use double uh curves for titanium that's one of the functionability uh


well i th i think you two uh especially you and uh and uh daniel you d you you both had uh the less creative uh roles in the project
'cause i think m
i think jeroen and i we had a more design we could have more we had more room for creativity than than you two
ha
nah the leadership wasn't crappy it was the leader that was crappy nah no the leadership was okay
yeah it was good



try to learn from your mistake and we will never do it again
yeah that went w it went well it's it's just uh
nah yeah we we had some trouble with the pen but
yeah but us
yeah

oh


no i have it working but uh yeah well uh
no it doesn't have that much added value to the
yeah

know what i mean


or text function just t t type text and that that would be uh excellent mean


oh
but uh problem is well you can't discuss anything well you you ca uh you can but you will discuss
a lot less than l like we did now we i mean uh w w w one one person
s maybe said three but well uh i we said uh no i w th think two because this and this and then
you can react uh on it but if you you put a three on it uh just figure well everybody
knows what i'm knowing so they'll all just put a two on
yeah but it would yeah
yeah okay the for processing part but then uh i think the idea of one person entering it
and the rest uh discussing it that uh isn't that bad idea actually
not that your opinion isn't valued but but still


yeah sure
y yikes seventy five pages


so you you finished it actually and so we just have to read it and say yes or no

it's not double uh it's not double anymore eh
yeah okay
yeah

on thing uh
one small thing uh the added functions uh was it included in the cost i don't think so eh
it's very cheap






okay um hereby is the meeting is finished


j  and j 
evaluation
hmm
hmm interesting
ah okay
cool
j  and j 
jane and jane
'kay guys take it away



hmm
okay
yeah
okay
hmm
's l it's like an uh easter egg

weemote
wait what i w got in mind
mm hmm
hmm
hmm maybe it's an idea to sell it without a cover so that you can pick a cover in the in the shop
yeah okay yeah okay
hmm mm
oui okay
yeah
an another idea uh maybe we could uh develop a cover uh with wood style they'll please the elder users as well
yes
not not too uh yeah
yeah exactly
yeah or blue or
well i i i think so yeah except for the buttons it's it could be a standard model
'kay it's my time now


okay
during the
oh
during the design uh design life cycle we uh
we made lot of requirements and trend analysis and stuff um now is the time to uh evaluate our prototype concept to uh
to the past requirements so we are going to evaluate the design according to the past user requirements and trends analysis um we're going to do that with a seven point scale
opening a word document now
okay
one oh okay uh i have to expla explain something we have to
uh
be consensive about about things so it has to be a group uh group decision okay uh
we're going to vote we yeah the prototype yeah
okay one the remote control is designed for people with age below forty

seven is false
yeah b one or
most true
yeah so so a o one is appropriate or more like a four three
ah exactly
exactly
three
yeah
but also for yeah okay uh second the remote control is beautiful
yeah acco according to us it's one or
yeah p s
of c of course you have to be uh very positive and uh enthusiastic about your own product
three uh the remote control looks fancy
one
good four the remote control has big clear channel switching buttons
daniel
uh teletext buttons and volume buttons
false
and volume
true
big and clear
hey
hey
hide

it's it's not yeah it
j
five okay
yeah it's it's yeah


red okay volume
the remote control is easy to be found


oh okay but 'kay look if you put uh your normal uh remote control under your bed or you throw this remote control under your bed is it better findable
a li little bit maybe
four
fi
i
ah i i i think five it's it's it doesn't really make a lot of
four
yes but five is between four and six
b 
yeah it it's
yeah yeah but but the survey under users was that they uh really lost it
like no not uh not seeing it but lost it in the house or something but okay
yeah okay yeah i i agree i agree okay eight the remote control has fresh fruity colours
yeah yeah not too flashy
the remote control is made of soft material
three
easy to use
top easy to use it's it's not the most easy to use
it can be easier
jus just with ten buttons that's the easiest
yeah but the most uh easy to use is just with one button
on t

yeah okay but easy n not not the most easy to use i think
two
we also have to compare it to the uh
to the remote controls on the market nowadays so
yeah yeah i'm uh hurrying okay eleven the remote control is innovative
a very of course
the remote control has m remova removable from multilux
the remote control i it has speech recognition false
the remote control has built in games
yeah
and the last paren parental advisory function
yes i do
save as
okay i will uh
do the the math
now it's your turn

no
advanced chip
advanced chip is three
three euros yep
okay one piece yeah
no
speech recognition i think
no
no
thingy
yes three eight
okay go on just go on
two
two
no
s

yeah but but d but daniel tha that's that's another brand that's another article
to sell
that doesn't account for this producing this
no
yeah
yeah of course
yeah
daniel daniel what do you think about here what do you think about uh putting
a battery in it but also selling like uh the covers a docking station
just apart from the from the thing so that you can uh put uh
rechargeable batteries in it and just
yeah yeah okay
just an idea yeah
yeah of course
yeah
yeah
yeah
hey those ar arcs why are there for the blue blue uh
okay
no no no
yeah
but wha 'kay look what is the uh if you make it double curved it costs one euro more but
no but
does it have a lot of extra uh fun function more like
yeah
yeah uh aesthetic
i mean uh you make like eleven and a half euros profit
instead of twelve and a half but
i don't know if twelve and a half is uh a fixed uh fixed price
no we can't go above that yeah
yeah okay then it's okay
yeah
yeah i think so
yeah
what a what about all the m the environment freaks not freaks the envi
no i i think it's it's
it look like this one

yeah


yeah
this is it
ah no we have to do all those hours again
go back one back
costs on uh no redesign
yeah
yeah okay yeah
hmm
i i didn't think so that there was a lot of room for it but
that's mainly because uh of the information that was delivered to us it was just fixed information
and get your stuff from there and i couldn't go on on i on the internet and search my own
stuff bu
yeah
yeah
yeah yeah that's true
leadership was uh crappy
okay

no leadership was uh
okay i thought uh the first meeting was a little bit of unstructured meeting uh you could
have but uh it was your first no uh no disrespect or something but you could have uh structure it
a l little bit more so like i i was talking most of the time the first meeting
meeting and yeah but
about me
yeah you made up
no it you did better
yeah
much more constructive

two guys
okay
means
digital pen i thought uh th the first time i did individual work i used it but a and the first two meetings i brought it with me but i didn't use it at all after the first the first meeting
it's it's not real real use for me
not really no

yeah like when you do this
smaller
oh sorry
okay new ideas

do you go on
yeah mm yeah i think so

did you heard what he said i don't i don't know what i mean
oh i have some figure here the eva the evaluation
the mm the mean uh number is uh one point eight one point eight six
so that's fairly uh fairly good i think
uh that uh
all the requirements uh are true or very true right yep

yeah may maybe the idea you proposed is uh a screen here and draw it and it's it's placed over there
hmm no
ah very bad but
i think this is better than regular flip overs but
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah but insert image isn't available
here picture from scanner clip art
hyperlink
hey what if you do like hyperlink
type type it
re real reaction dot n l 
yes is now is okay okay
huh
'kay double click it
you're erasing
double click it
yeah
yep
what i really miss also is uh
is a d is a turtle is a decision uh decision system like um
with the evaluation you have to
polls like what do you want a one a two maybe a a l a little application like uh uh give your own number and click one two three four five six seven
yeah j ju ju yeah v voting application just a little group group decision application
yeah
yeah okay
yeah of course but uh you can still discuss about it but but click it in an application that's a lot easier to process
the digit yeah
yeah

yeah
okay that's it

celebration
yeah
yeah
what is an end report
yeah
yeah yeah
oh you ha you have ten minutes left i uh read
you have now ten minutes left to finish up the end report
yeah
um
you you already made a beta version or
pages
okay daniel
do you want a chair maybe
hey
oh okay
five minutes for finishing
management expert you have to change that
marketing
yeah but you can save it u the under another name
maybe um the
the
yeah
you yeah no you have to put uh switch channels uh at the top because that's the most used function and teletext at the second
oh nay a volume changing second
s switch yes
yeah okay go on
yes very good
yeah yeah
the order

single curves

no okay
was initial the plan the initial plan

no it's it's not very cheap but that no but it's a development
inside corporation like uh w we don't have to buy parental control
our own people can make that i think yeah it it has some cost but
yeah
real reaction
okay still the end conclusion that's all i think
yeah but but the the decisions are put in the uh conclusion i think why we decided to use a flat uh l c d 
yeah um
save it
hmm
yeah but then you had the same thing
example of children remote oh wait wait

hmm
that's a pity
you declare
yo
ow
uh
yeah
what the
uh
yeah well ja well let's just start i've uh made a presentation
uh but uh i'll open it on the smartboard so we can all see it
so it's in the project documents because that's what we can find here
well very nice
well this is called the the the kick off meeting so uh i'm the project manager so i had to fill it in and uh hmm
oh sorry
and an uh a nice agenda
uh we'll do the opening and then uh
we'll meet each other what uh we already do so that's not uh very much trouble i'll i'll show you the
the tools we have here so that we can all use them then uh we'll look at the project plan from uh real reaction
we'll discuss about our first ideas about the project and then uh we'll close the meeting and then we can uh individually uh do our things and then uh we'll get back here so this the opening we'll uh
we have to uh design a new television remote control you have heard that uh already i think so um we want it to be original so a nice uh a nice new design
uh trendy it's also for young people and we have to just uh make it uh modern
and uh friendly so size does matter and uh
well it has to be a have the the right uh the right buttons on the right place that kin those kind of things
other uh
there happen to be uh three stages functional conceptual and d detailed design
um so every time we we'll do some individual work get meeting talk about it uh and then go into the next phase
that's just it
um
we have uh these two smartboards
um well as i just showed there's a project management folder a project document folder
on the desktop it just works exactly the same as a computer you just uh click on the on the folder and you open the
everything you you put in it with your laptop so you can uh make uh words excel everything
um and the w the r uh the rest uh also works the same so uh when you open a notepad you uh you just get your uh things you can uh draw this is a uh well a drawing board
you have a these
different uh functions on the board you can see them there
so you have a a nice pen and it's works just like a bal ball pen this is just a
i want to uh
oh yeah of course w doesn't work any more
yes i will eraser so
it's fantas fantastic we can uh uh well you can save a file so if uh we draw we have to save everything don't throw anything away
uh just we can start a new one
and we just go on and don't throw anything away just uh let them all uh stand here
we can delete but we don't do that um you can here select a pen you can draw anything you want it's a
bit uh childish you have to write it's not as fast as you w you know it
but it does work sometimes
well it's just like a normal uh
paint so it's gone
well we are designers so we have to have a a more uh a smartboard so that's fantastic um well this uh speaks for itself
we going to try it
so um we all uh are going to uh draw a nice animal on this board not my idea
yes our your favourite so um i'm to going to have to draw a kangaroo but i'm going d
i'm not going to i'm just uh going to uh well draw a nice uh
beast w i dunno what i'm going to design oh um doesn't oh
yeah 'kay
hmm
i just said it's not my idea but i am the project manager and officially this is my idea so what
ah the first the first meeting is just a bit uh loose loosen up a bit uh meeting each other well uh uh nice yeah sh
i hope our industrial designer does this better because uh this is uh
no so a a few legs
yes yes guess well i should make it an hippo now
no i don't think so
well what is it huh
yeah difficult english word i didn't knew it myself
our characteristics sum it up well it's uh very uh painful those kind of thing so we can uh just uh
we're going back and now uh our industrial designer can uh draw its uh most favourite animal huh
oh uh but this uh marketing designer

what kind of animal is that then
uh it
yeah
no no no what are you going to do

no no no no save it and start a new uh save it
and start a new black uh doc a blank document
yeah well we have to save everything so now um the next one uh
and then save it and start an blank document
yeah there's also different colours and different uh
well pen widths uh the line the the thickness thickness so um well you should uh try it but uh
well y y y you could have but uh
it speaks for itself
what the uh just a duck
nice

is it a duck
is it a plane
it doesn't draw uh circles uh that easy uh
yeah just a bit a bit childish a bit

well uh save the document and then uh
and then a a new blank document for
uh will uh choose a new colour and a new pen width so w we can all see it
no well first yeah and then you go to format i think
and current colour you choose a new colour and a new
pen width uh also format
it's not like in paint line width and you can choose a nice one width width with each other

yeah
so just a wa that's the way we do it's quite easy
mm hmm oh pussy
well then you change it
and erase things
what super pig
so
yeah yeah yeah we know
yes alright it's a cat

well well um
yeah save it and start a new blank document
yep so that's uh what we're going to use when we uh need it well it's terrific eh
yeah that's it we're one big happy family now well then uh the serious uh stuff
we're we want to sell it at twenty five euros internationally um so um but we dunno what exactly th i it is in dollars but uh twenty five euros
our profit aim is worldwide fifty million euros
so i didn't uh exactly uh calculate how much we have to sell
we want to keep it our costs at twelve and a half euros so keep
uh that in mind when we uh talk about our uh materials an f and stuff and uh marketing
uh research
now then we all uh we can uh sit down and discuss uh what do we think about our current remote controls first about design uh about uh aim in the market
etcetera well uh we c we can sit down uh because uh presentation can wait we can uh take notes and uh
well who has uh some uh remarks about the current uh remote controls
please
no uh i did
well uh just w we're uh four uh if we if we would just have one then
yeah
yeah yeah
yep
that's alright
that would be a nice idea yes
yep yep yep
yes fifty million is our aim to a profit so
yes
i'll make uh notes and then uh maybe uh well i'll put it in the project uh folder when i'm done uh just now well yeah
no that's right
y y you don't use uh the half of them that's that's culture uh international
yes
yep and maybe we do uh we even have uh more than just a d v d  player don't we have uh other uh ou
uh
we also uh just uh released a t f t  uh thing i saw
yeah
yep
well yeah
it doesn't have to be but we can
well except if we deliver it together with our d v d 
yeah because we look at competitors and w if we pick up the good things about that and give it a nice design
yes
yep
yeah
oo
n we can use uh it as a as a game pad so one hand has the beer so the other hand uh
well i we already uh one of our aims is that it has to be original and trendy so
well there has been done a lot of researches about remotes uh we have to we can imagine uh because it's a long time uh on the market so the the form will have been uh tested out so
yes
well for me personally i have a a lot of remotes uh at home but those ones that have
a a round ending and uh well uh just an uh square uh middle
i don't like to use them i have uh have to it has to fit my hands when it falls over it and
i just have and then the button that i use most has to be here
it f it fits your hands and then you just push the button that you use most with thumb
tho tho those new d v d  players on the market do have those
d v d  players yes
well
a it h it has it it has a that's tha th th shape that it fits your hand that's


we have five minutes left so
yes uh that's yep
yep
ha
sound nice yes
well it's just uh about our first ideas now so i think individually we'll have to uh come up with ideas for the next meeting about these materials and markets etcetera yes
yes
well thirty minutes we have so um
this is about uh what we are going to uh do uh you'll get specific instructions when you're back in your room so uh it's uh logical uh i think
oh and uh that's uh that's all so we'll just get a notice that the the meeting is uh over yeah yes say
well i have had remotes that um they had uh the function of the buttons was
about uh uh a layer over the buttons and when i've had use it much it was gone so it has
to be made in the buttons i think it has to uh not be loose
yeah
is there an a universal uh universal way of um transmitting from the remote to the television so it's all about uh
it's not that in china it's different
yeah
but y you can have uh of course different between d v d s and televisions and between
yeah
probably yes china rules


well i think uh w we can look into that in the in the next uh thirty minutes yeah
yes
well j just y you get a n a normal front with it but you can change them uh when you buy the
and we should uh dispatch those kind of fronts fronts a a around the world so uh
well th those fifty million don't uh don't se sells itself so we have to uh make uh some extra effort like fronts uh
yes yeah well it has to it h it has to fit the the te television and d v d  set we are going to sell so if they are uh black and black black and silver we'll make them black and silver so
yeah
well if if you yeah if you have a a a television room for little children and you make a if if you buy a a pink front they'll they'll love it i think
but that's uh marketing uh research you can uh you can ask uh
yes

well our user interface you can uh maybe uh i don't know what your specific instructions will be but uh probably about uh the precision of the buttons and and those kind of things and what buttons will have to be on the
uh remote and you will look into the technical design and um form i think
or something like that
yeah
yeah
euro well it it it's if you uh
finish meeting now oh alright well uh we're going to back uh back into our rooms so
in thirty minutes but uh i think it will be you will be warned uh through your laptop uh to get over here i'll have to restore my uh my desktop uh because uh it's it's the half of the normal size
oh right oh ma
w that was a nice meeting
yeah see you
hi there







we want to erase it
thanks
big bird
mm

uh no i don't it's just a bird

here you go
mm
width
hmm

it's a pussy cat



it certainly is

easy to learn
yeah
yeah
i also think we should not add too many buttons modern day uh remotes have too much buttons i think
precisely
yeah
yeah indeed
yeah we should make it compatible perhaps with everything we use we uh we make
yeah
and i think the people who who will buy our uh remote already have some experience with remotes so we can keep that in mind

w well it's a n it's a new remote and you don't buy a remote if you don't have anything to uh to control with it
yeah alright but
yeah yeah we could use another form or shape or colour that kind of things
well we we could make more more oval or something and and
yeah or so
well yeah it's new

but young people want something different and it is
yeah
yeah alright
yeah
yeah it doesn't fit
no if y if you look at new phillips uh d v d  with their uh remotes pl players they they are the new remotes aren't box shaped they're all um
well
yeah
yes uh
well most of of them are are somewhat thicker at the end and get um yeah thinner towards the uh the other end
mm
yeah it
yeah yea
hmm

yeah

yeah maybe we can um just like on cell phones those um well
you can you can put on on them and so you can customise your uh your own remote with different colours
or or special paint jobs i dunno but
well

mm
yeah that's bad yeah
yeah that's important
yeah
but our t v s are mostly made in china and that sort of country so



yeah
yes yes
mm
well you can make profit with them and it's a way to make them trendy
yeah alright
yeah normal
no a colour everyone accepts
mm
mm
yeah
standard
well young people s li
yeah yeah yeah

yeah
what's the uh url or the website 'cause i didn't
get
yeah
oh oh right oh well i didn't uh use it

yes
next meeting is in
thirty minutes
yeah alright it's it's handy to know



oh goodbye
s


mm hmm
maybe you should try to write on the on the big white uh does it yeah it works
wonderful
mm hmm

alright yep




i hope this was part of the assignment and not uh your uh i hope this was part of the assignment and not uh your personal uh enjoyment

i i i i understand alright
so start
yep yes
don't uh count on it
i think it's a mouse or a rat
oh
oh i know it
it's a hedgehog
well i'm amazed uh about your uh drawing skills

yeah

i am the industrial designer
chief i am the industrial designer
yeah
i think
it's pr it resembles the animal drawn by
i think can i say it

it looks amazing
these are very impor
these are very important documents of course uh these drawings uh
and he deliberately draws a animal we don't know the english word for
it looks like an uh
it looks like that beast from sesame street
yeah
it's it's uh

do we have to uh
but we have uh do we have to name the specific species of the bird
no
well wonderful
why do i have to do the difficult tasks uh pen yeah that's
uh current colour
i like uh oh they don't have pink oh b oh think this is uh
uh uh
line width
uh fifteen and i can draw
uh

oh the line width is too thick but oh well
uh
it smiles nicely
now i have to change the line width
uh one
these are whiskers you know
uh well i think it's obvious right now
miaow
well if this isn't obvious
i'll save it alright uh save
uh yeah uh blank
well i feel comfortable now thanks for this exercise
i feel totally at ease
yeah something like that
so

alright
well i i didn't have to prepare anything about uh it's not it's it's not my task to uh talk about uh experience with current remote controls but uh
mm hmm
no but uh the b the buttons have to uh have to have uh international recognisable buttons and uh
and numbers and uh that every culture in uh yeah people in every country can recognise
alright
yeah so it doesn't uh become too complicated with too much buttons and uh
and stereo uh s uh audio installations
most people do yeah
it doesn't it doesn't have to be
yeah
well
hmm
it has to be different and familiar at the same time
yeah the shape will will have to be recognised i thought about uh like most uh remote controls uh are uh a long box shaped thing you can make it uh triangle shaped but that's not uh very recognisable
oval
i
mm
oh but it ha it has to be m yeah but you still have to know it's a remote and not another
yeah
yeah so the long box uh shaped thing must be uh yeah useful
or else uh they would have been ano another shape
yeah yeah a lo the long box shape yeah you have to use one hand
why not
but it does fit in the hand if you hold it like this and you can make it another shape but then you have
w no w what else i di
yeah well but uh what what what do you suggest then
hmm well but it's still then uh the the long box uh but then with some uh round uh round forms in it to fit your hand but it's it's still
yeah yeah al alright but but it's still it's still sort of box yeah it it has round forms but it in the end it's still the box so that's what i mean
yeah yeah i understand but no no i don't mean an entire box like completely square but a also with round edges of course but in in in at the end it's still this long
box shape with convenient uh round uh shapes uh
to fit
yeah yes i thought about something like that
yeah
a big recognisable button on top or something
the buttons should uh also be not too small not too big of course and uh n uh uh not too close uh together
uh huh
yeah of course uh to uh to uh to have icons to explain the different functions yeah
colours yeah
i think we have to talk also about uh the the materials for um

already thought about something tha
mm hmm
yeah now we can still talk about the material we have some some minutes left uh i w wrote down uh that the case should be plastic of course hard plastic the buttons should be uh rubbery i think uh
no n n
mm alright and of course there are several electrical cables in it to uh to connect things uh to each other
i think so it's a a common stan standard way infrared beams an infrared beam i think
it it's a we we make an a universal remote so it ha has to work with uh all kinds of brands and things

and have well yeah i've wrote something down about how it works the user presses a button and with an infrared beam it signals the television set accordingly but that's pretty obvious i think
well but th but the standard front will be uh just grey or something uh b a simple colour not not very flashy
pink television sets pink remote
alright
i must not forget my pen the next time
mm yeah also the the look and feel uh of the the remote's also my task yeah
yeah i uh w was wondering that too y you went to the company website
it's the the the start uh starting page uh
very handy to know
right see you in half an hour then
w
right uh see you in thirty minutes then

i dunno
throwing away my toothpick
'kay
nice user interface

'kay
right let's see it
'kay

mm hmm


alright your favourite animal
grizzly bear

yeah
we're kinda losing time though
we're losing time but
alright
do we have to guess a hippo yeah

i don't know how to call it a hedgehog



alright
thank you

it's
yeah sure
it's a rabbit well
looks very nice right

yes
yes uh right
you go man
alright
i should have made mine a white rabbit

you're standing in front of it i can't see it alright thank you yeah it's a bird but what kind of bird
you have to push harder
release your anger


hmm
it's a cat
it's a pig
right
no it looks great
just save it
oh great
it's good for group spirit

right
right
i think it's im it's important to uh look at uh the remote controls of our competitors
get the good points uh try to merge them into one universal remote control on our
corporate site i saw uh a new d v d  player uh we're gonna produce
maybe it's important to make it compatible with the d v d  player
so you can uh use your television and your d v d  player with the same uh remote control
furthermore it's important to make it uh acceptable for the whole world for different cultures maybe because we want to we want to well fifty million
yeah yeah so a lot of people have to be able to use it
so
yeah
yeah that's right
mm hmm
right
maybe we could make one button to switch between d v d  player and t v  and make the other buttons uh multi functional or something
yeah right
yeah so but th that's kind kind of standard t  television so it also works on that
yeah but
we need to to keep it consistent with other d uh
yeah but it's it has to be useable
yeah
no
not with two hands
yeah yeah yeah right no
yeah but it's quite important that it fits
yeah
yeah
it shouldn't be boxy
nah
i don't agree with the long box uh shape it it has to be custom made for the hand
yeah
yeah but if you shape it
if

no that's ol old fashioned
i can imagine that us
well
yeah right
it fits in your palms
hmm
um
well
yeah but it has it has to fit your hand it shouldn't be too boxy you know it's
no no no
yeah
yeah it should be
right maybe something like this or and then a button here to switch between different systems like d v d  player and so you can i've
yeah right and i do think we have to keep this kind of idea
with the with the numbers and
right
but it should be possible to to um make it
ap apparent that there are two functions for every button so there has to be some space between the buttons yeah
yeah right right and maybe we should use colours
yeah
that's kinda trendy
yeah right
right
but
i think it's uh it's important to uh notate all the the decisions that we make so we
yeah
no problem
yeah
yeah it shouldn't be too heavy
yeah yeah yeah
yeah it's univ yeah yeah yeah
yep
and you can use
yeah

but are
are we going w uh with the front uh fronts uh idea
i think we should make it universal and you can always use a front front on it you know you can use it just plain but you can
to make it more trendy
right
right
yeah
yeah right
yeah yeah yeah
but people of often don't like bright colours or something we have to make it grey or s or black
yeah but then you can use a a front
yeah that's right
yeah or a t teletubby front yeah yeah yeah i will investigate
right
it's
yeah yeah yeah just if you start up your internet explorer
yeah
well that's great
thirty minutes
it's totally broken
oh

okay
does anyone want to see uh steve's feedback from the specification
right
not really um just what he's talking about like duplication of effort and
like duplication of effort and stuff and um yeah he was saying that we should maybe uh think about having a prototype for week six which is next week yeah
so we should probably prioritize our packages
mm
yeah
yeah
hmm has has anyone actually looked at the java code for the huh hmm
yeah i think so
yeah i i don't know about the search functionality that might be online depends how it's gonna work
yeah
mm hmm
yeah that makes sense
hmm
hmm
yeah you just concatenate them together
hmm
yeah
it just means it loads on demand it only loads when it needs a particular type of file like when it's being accessed
yeah i think that's the idea it just loads the particular ones it needs
but if you were doing a search over the whole corpus you'd have to load them all
hmm
mm
hmm
yeah we do not want it in to develop a little tree display as well for multiple results
yeah but that'd be quite easy to do
you just need to find the time stamp
yeah
yeah
yeah i think i think those segments for each utterance are split up
think so
yeah i'm pretty sure it's already there pretty sure that's already there the the utterances are numbered
hmm
yeah i think so
ye that's the impression i get yeah
oh
hmm
ye
mm
yeah uh
right
okay
topics yeah
yeah i think that's the right one
hmm
hmm
mm hmm

mm
hmm
yeah that'd be much more efficient to do that yeah
hmm
hmm
yeah you're able to do that in java yeah
yeah

huh
hmm
yeah i've had a b i've had a look at the the topic segments how it's stored and then
yeah th those are few per meeting and it um well it gives a time stamp and inside each one there's uh
the actual like utterance segments
and the list of them that occurred and they're all numbered
um so that's where that's stored
yeah so i guess um if i'm gonna be segmenting it with a l c  seg then that's like same format i'd want to um put it back out in so it'd be equivalent
well like the integration what do you mean integration
hmm
i don't know i don't think anyone's been allocated to do that yet

yeah yeah
yeah definitely
hmm yeah
yeah it c could be difficult yeah
yeah
well i guess the important thing is to get the crucial m modules built
ye yeah
yeah and then
yeah and then we'll maybe have to prioritize somebody into just integrating it
mm hmm
yeah i think so
uh yeah
hmm yeah yeah jasmine i thought you just said that you'd uh looked at extracting the text
yeah so you you said you did it in python yeah
yeah did you use uh b the x l  uh x m l  parser in python right yeah sounds pretty good so
um 'cause yeah i was having a look in it a look at it as well and i noticed the um the speakers
are all in that separate file so did did you have to combine them all and and then re order them
yeah
ye yeah c
right yeah so that's approach um well i was going to do so yeah we may as well collaborate
in the word files
i'm not sure i what you mean
oh right
hmm
hmm
mm i thought they were local to th a particular meeting


hmm
mm is there anything else we should discuss
yeah should we not have like a group directory or something where we can put all our code in and that kinda thing
hmm
i've gotten mm hardly any

hmm
yeah we can ask steve if um we can get space
yeah uh we could do that

yeah i'm sure he had to deal with that last year



yeah
hmm


that sounds good
hmm
hmm
yeah that's what i'm gonna need
yes
yeah it's just mo changing it a bit
yeah
no but uh that's what m l c  seg does it it marks the end of each segment
yeah
yeah
oh
yeah
yeah for me it's better if they're by meeting
then that'll be really easy to do once they've got the raw text it's just a case of running the script
yeah i mean hopefully this week
alright
and we could
don't know suppose we're just getting on with all our
components so
i know wa
yeah yeah he suggested that we could have an uh initial prototype
i know i'd b i'd be surprised if we can get anything working by next week
alright
yeah
yeah i mean if we just want to have um some data for the user face could even be random data uh mm mm
yeah i'm
hmm
yes
hmm yes
hmm
i'm not so sure
i i thought we would just have like um one big summary um with all the
uh different importance levels um displayed on it and depending
on what our um zoom level is we just display a part of it
and we would have one very big thing off line and from that we would just select what we are displaying
yes so for example you would um give a high value to those um sequences you want to display in the meeting series summary and you just cut off
that was what i sh i thought yeah i thought
but i think the m difference might be that we want just want to have um the words and that's not
so much what he meant with not possibly loading everything was that
you m um load all the uh annotation stuff all the sound files all
in
um i r i i'm getting quite lost um at the moment because um w what's
um our difference between the um se um uh the importance measure
and the skimming i mean do we do both or is it the same thing
okay
so but when when we talk about summaries you talk about this uh abo about skimming and not about
yeah
yeah right isn't that the skimming isn't that the skimming
yeah but it use the same data

yeah
a
and yeah i think we also thought about combining that measure with um the measures
i get from um s uh hot spots and so on so that would also
be on utterance level i think i think
yes sure
yes
yes right
oops it does so i define baseline and what it loads for example it loads all the utterances
and so on but it doesn't load um the discourse acts and
for example not the and what's what else there not the summaries
it only loads those on demand
y you mean that you um basically split up th the big thing into um different
summaries for example that you have a very um top level
um summary and a separate file for for each level
mm hmm
yes
n uh no no it's f for
no you're right yeah it's for
um
no i i think we would just take the segments that are already that were yeah there's um this segments file um you know the x m l  segments
oh
that i don't know
yeah that's um
mm hmm
there there are time stamps um for well segments um and for th um segments is for example when when you look at the data what is displayed in one line
what when when you look at it in the hmm
i think so isn't
um for ex um i i compared it with what i did for the pause um duration extraction
um and basically it's uh words that are uttered in a sequence without pauses
but sometimes um however there are um short pauses in it and they're indicated by square
brackets pause or something in the data
um someti uh but uh the annotators decided what was one segment and what wasn't
i think so
yeah but um i think for some annotations um an uttera ca utterance can have several um types for example for the dialogue acts and so on
okay yeah that should be for
yeah should be yeah

yes but that's
yeah everything that's a word has a sti time stamp
that's at the end that's at the end i think her time
yeah maybe
didn't have a look at our meetings
uh i i think it wouldn't as it occurs i mean it would be it occurs in every meeting so
and i think it even has uh its own annotation like digits or something so that should be really easy to cut out
yeah i'm sure
ah it's just to test the system i think
so
mm they have to read numbers from
uh i didn't have a look at that so
they
mm hmm
uh th yeah

'kay um i just um wondered so who's uh then
doing um the frequencies on on the words because i'm
i think i will also um i could also make use of it um for the agreement and disagreement
thing because i um i in my outline i talked about um
using the um discourse acts first and um then in the
chunks of text i found looking for word patterns and so on so um
i would for example need the um most freq um frequent words
so if you cut off all that i'd won't be use or
yeah i i but i need it for my chunks then i would
you know
yeah but i'd uh i would like to look at the frequency of words in my um in
the regions of text i found out to be interesting so
i wouldn't need it it it would have to be re calculated only for my segments
huh
uh uh mm i think it would be
you know l as as big at as the hot spot annotation things that's quite
small yeah that's some utterances
yes yeah yeah so i would probably just concatenate all my um text chunks and then let's say m i will run over it
yes
yes definitely

yeah right
ye
m
um jasmine uh um what is um the text you're extracting uh looking like then at the end
because um i i think it's actually very similar to what i did for my um speaker
um uh extraction and i think i would ch perhaps have to
change two lines of codes to get you um for each meeting a file that says fr from
um this millisecond to this millisecond there was this sequence of words
and so on
so that's just changing two lines of code and it would give you that so
um yeah so far i extracted um the dura durations but it's from the
words file so i could just um contatenate concatenate
um the words instead of the durations and it should
i mean
should be very
straight forward
i can try to do it and send it to you pe and you have a look at it will it make sense for what you want
yeah uh p i mean it i just let it run over all the files so
yes i just ordered
uh i ordered according to the um starting times of the utterances
what do you mean by diffe
yeah i mean t i i have one what i give you would be one file for each meeting
yeah not for each meeting series i didn't do that yet
yeah one group yeah


yeah i mean there's one series that has just one meeting
yes um the you you the data is of the form you have um three identification
letter so b e d  or b b d  or something and that's always the same group and then
after that there's um a number like o o  one o o  two so it's a
yeah but that's that's really quite easy to see because they're named

yes but i i mean as um the start uh start times
um start for each meeting at zero you could just probably just um
add the um final second time to the next meeting and so on and just
put it all together but then we would have to change um the information about who
on which channel it was set um to by which person it was set and that is actually
stored in another x m l  document
yeah i w would then just not print out the um start and end times
no it's for every single word
or for every single utterance yeah that depends on what you want
yeah but i do it with perl it's just string manipulation so i would i mean i would just
sure
no i didn't do a sea no
and you would want that all in one file for all the corpus or
for the series
yeah i can directly put it into uh just like
so uh only words um per meeting series
uh huh
yes
yeah they will just i will just take i would uh take over the names they have anyway
yeah yeah
yeah one series has the um same three starting letters so
so only words and words and times and you
yeah you want it ordered okay okay anybody
um ord base dot times
yeah and do you want
yeah sometimes they're contained in one another so
just after th mm hmm 'kay
ordered only words
um and i think um for all the corpus it's just from i know from other times it's um nine megami byte to have i mean should be should be similar to have the words should be
na um all the words together um for all the meetings
that's what i'm guessing that's you know um what i because nine mega byte is what i got for when i said for every um utterance this is goes from there to there and
takes takes seconds
oh yeah i mean i'm it doing it for all of it doesn't matter
yeah i mean i hope it will be the same for the words it's just what i
i
mm hmm mm so so um i will probably send um just one file of the first meeting um to all those who need it so that you can have a look whether that's what you want
yeah i mean if it's just for one meeting it's really not too big
yeah

what do we have to demonstrate

the basic word importance is off line as well the combined measure might not be if we want to wait what the user has typed in into the search
yeah


i'm not quite so what it did you want to do it i you just wanted to assign
uh i thought about words
mm
mm okay
yeah but how about those words which don't carry any meaning at all the um and uhs and something like that
because if we if we average average over over a whole utterance all the words
and there are quite unimportant words in there but quite important words as well i think we should
just disregard the the
okay
alright



yeah
but there is no i d  for an utterance i think it's just for individual words so how do we do that then we for utterances as well
i think it's just for one
word so we have to
yeah
uh i'm not quite sure i have only seen that the uh the individual words have got an i d 
yeah you always could have a look at the time stamps and then take the ones that uh belong together to form an utterance
yeah if they are already there's it's easy but it would be possible
uh yeah okay



you s uh you said you are currently in uh implementing the idea what exactly are you computing
okay
okay
mm hmm

mm hmm

yeah i w i w i would need the raw text pretty soon because i have to find out um how i have to put the segments into bins and then yeah
no that's not necessary
yes i did but um i've only just got the notes i have to still have uh to order everything by the time and
yeah i think it's quite easy after the
yeah yeah
so uh
mm hmm
yeah b i uh w that's what i was uh thought that you just combine them and then order the time stamps accordingly
okay um what i found out was that there are quite a lot of things without without s time stamps in the beginning
yeah and uh x m l  files yeah that's just an i d  or something i don't know just numbers
yes but what are the other things that's uh some kind of number f maybe the file number or something that is in the beginning what is that
do you know
um i think there are quite a lot of numbers in the beginning where n there is no time stamp for the numbers
it's
think they say um quite a lot of numbers and before that uh um there's this number was it
yeah there i are numbers in the um the w  tag but there are no time stamps
yeah
yeah in the beginning as well sometimes i think at least i saw some
yeah
yeah

but what it is it actually that numbers
okay so but there are no time stamps annotated to that it's it's quite strange
and also um there are different um combinations of letters b r e  and something like that is it everything ordered are the time stamps global or uh are they local at any point
okay

yeah it's rainbow it's um i think it's just the dictionary in the first place but

um no i have to bin it up and so i will only have counts for each each bin or something
it's because um rainbow is a text classification system and i think it's not possible to have just one class that's the problem
maybe we could
yeah sure you sure we could do that but i don't that makes sense
if we need just frequencies maybe we should just calculate them by using perl or something i don't know
yeah it's quite easy to just count and s or sort them by um frequency
just using a perl script
is it too big
yeah
hmm
i don't know how you how many terms you can handle in perl
mm yeah
uh i can get all the raw text but it has to be ordered still so
no it isn't
um it's in what is implemented in rainbow is information gain and i'm not quite sure how they calculate that
yeah
uh that's what rainbow does i think you j can just get probabilities for a certain words for each document
certain
um we would have to look at that
mm hmm
oh

yeah that's what i thought as well that you that probably the the topic segment level is the most um informative for the words
yeah that's the problem i don't know

mm hmm




so shall we sit together tomorrow then as well uh okay
um yeah w would it be best at the moment it's it's just lines of
mm hmm
um
okay so um you'd do you extract the words the raw text as well uh
okay
mm hmm
print out

okay okay that
okay

so have we already extracted from all the files
yeah
did you also order
mm hmm
hmm
hmm


okay
uh i don't need the times i just need the words but um
yeah in the right order yes
yeah that doesn't matter too much i think



hmm
mm hmm
how long would it take to make the frequency counts with a java hash table
yeah
no how long you would have to program something
okay
mm
because it's quite easy in perl as well it's just a line of code for counting all the words and yeah it's it's by hashes
yeah
yeah
'kay



i i dry read it the last time

next week
yeah
yeah
no
uh mine's gonna be mostly using the off line but the actual stuff it's doing will be on line but it won't be very um processor intensive or memory intensive i don't think
don't think so
yeah
are we still gonna go for dumping it into a database are we still gonna dump it into a database

'cause if we are i reckon we should all read our classes out of the database it'll be so much easier
well if we're gonna dump the part of it into a database anyway we might as well dump all the fields we want
into the database calculate everything from there then we don't even have to worry that much about the
underlying x m l  representation we can just query it
well if we're gonna do that we should try and store everything in in an x m l  format as well
yeah
yeah
well we don't even need to do that 'cause if we got our information density calculated off line so all we do is treat the whole
lot as one massive document i mean they'll it's not gonna be so big that we can't load in a information
density for every utterance and we can just summarise based on that
i think you can do it on line
i don't think there's really much point in doing like that when it's just gonna feed off in the end the information density
measure basically and that's all calculated off line so what you're really doing is sorting a list
is the p computationally hard part of it
well like the ideas we're calculating are information density all off line first for every utterance
in the whole corpus right so what you do is you say if you're looking at a series of meetings you just say well our whole
document comprises of all these stuck together and then all you have to do is sort them
by j information density like maybe weighted with the search terms and then extract them i don't think
it's too slow to do on line to be honest

is that
yeah
well on the utterance level i was thinking so the utterances with the highest like mean information density
well the trouble with doing it on the word level is if you want the audio to synch up you've got no way of getting in and extracting just that word i mean it's impossible
for every single word oh okay
yeah
i don't think that will do it we'll have to buffer it
well the skimming's gonna use the importance
but like at first it's just gonna be i d f 
well mostly skimming yeah
yeah
well the nice thing about that is it will automatically be in sentences well more or less so it will make more sense and if you get just extract words
yeah
i see it
but it'll need to be calculated at word level though because otherwise there won't be enough occurrences of the terms to make any meaningful sense
yeah
yeah i reckon you can just mean it over the sentence
i think we should filter them
maybe we should have like um a cut off so it a w word only gets a value if it's above a certain threshold so anything that has less than say nought point five importance gets assigned to zero
yeah that's the other th
yeah
i think we'll have to buffer the audio but i don't think it will be very hard i think it would be like an hour or two's work
like just build an another f wave file essentially
yeah i mean i bet there would be packages
in memory yeah so just like unp there's bound to be like a media wave object or something like that and just build one in memory
i don't know i have no idea but it must have like classes for dealing with files and if it has classes for concatenating files you can do it in memory so
well what i think i might try and build is basically a class that you just feed it a linked list
of um different wave forms and it will just string them all together with maybe i don't
know tenth of a second silence in between each one or something like that
normalise it yeah
oh yeah yeah we'll need that
we also really wanna be able to search by who's speaking as well
it doesn't matter 'cause all the calculation's done off line
that's easy you just like create a new x m l  document in memory
i don't think it's really that much of a problem because if it's too big what we can do is just well all the off line stuff doesn't
really matter and all we can do is just process a bit at a time like for summarisation say we wanted
a hundred utterances in the summary just look at the meeting take the top one hundred utterances in each
other meeting if it scores higher than the ones already in the summary so far just replace them
and then you only have to process one meeting at a time
okay so maybe we should build a b store a mean measure for the segments and meetings as well
and speaker speaker and um topic segmenting we'll need as well
yeah
well yeah and then it'll f preserve the order when it's displayed the
yeah
yeah
yeah i think so
so we should basically make our own x m l  document in memory
that everyone's um
module changes that rather than the underlying data and then have that x m l  uh nite x m l  document tied to the interface
well you can make it in a file if you want
mm hmm
they are utterances aren't they the segments are utterances aren't they yeah
alright okay
well that's easy
well it's close enough isn't it it may not be exact every time but it's a so sort of size we're looking for
yeah yeah
yeah
but why don't we just write it as a new x m l  file can nite handle just loading arbitrary uh new like attributes and stuff
i mean i would have thought they'd make it able to
yeah
so why do we need to have two x m l  trees in memory at once
the other thing is that would mean we'd be using their parser as well which means we wouldn't have to parse anything which be quite nice 'cause their parser is probably much faster than anything we've come up with anyway

yeah i mean we can process it in chunks if it gets too big basically we can just process it all in chunks if it gets too big to load it into memory
i think we probably want to store sorry i think we probably want to store um
a hierarchical information density as well so like an informan mation density score
for each meeting and each topic segment 'cause otherwise we'd be recalculating the same thing over and over and over again
yeah
and that will obviously make it much easier to display
well it may not for the whole meeting but like
yeah exactly
yeah
well we can start off
like that well i was gonna start off i've v got sort of half way through implementing one that does just i d f 
and then just i can change that to work on whatever
yeah
and it should be weighted by stuff like the hot spots and um the key words in the search and stuff like that
did he not say something about named entities so i thought he said there wasn't very many
yeah
yeah it's not t f i d f  it's just inverse document frequency 'cause it's really easy to do basically there's just like for a baseline really
well i'm half way through it's not working yet but it will do
um yeah and then averaging it over the utterances
but it's not like um related to the corpus at all it's just working on an arbitrary text file at the moment
no
it would be useful to know how everyone's gonna store their things though
yeah
yeah well i've got like a few hours free like after this

it's the most boring task
yeah
or at least um simple versions of them
so maybe we should try doing something really simple like just displaying a whole meeting
and like just being able to scroll through it or something like that
yeah
are you free after this
how about friday then 'cause i'm off all friday
uh wednesday i've got a nine 'til twelve
yeah nothing in the afternoon i've got nothing in the afternoon so
okay so you ha yeah
where about just in appleton tower
uh i'll be in um the appleton tower anyway
um well i'll be there from twelve i've got some other stuff that needs done on matlab so if you're not there at twelve i can just work on that so
yeah
why w

yeah i'm just building a dictionary
oh mine's just gonna use the um hash map one in um java 'cause i'm only gonna do it on small documents it's just like bef until the information density is up and running just something to get give me something to work with
so it's only gonna use quite small documents you see to start with
why does it need to be classified into like different segments
can we just fill a second class with junk that we don't care about
like i don't know copies of shakespeare or something
'cause if what we're looking for is the um frequency statistics i don't see how that would be changed by the classification
i the
well there maybe another tool available
yeah
um i can't remember who's got it might be wordnet but one of these big corpuses
has a list of stop words that you can download and they're just basically lists of really uninteresting boring
words that we could filter out before we do that
it's like that's one the papers i read that's um one things they did right at the beginning is they've got this big s stop list and they just ignore all of those throughout the experiment
yeah i it would be useful for me as well
it uh i think that'd be useful for me as well yeah
yeah
well all you really wanna do is look into getting some sub set of the icsi corpus off the dice machines 'cause i hate working on dice it's awful
like so i can use my home machine
ha has a c d  burner though has a c d  burner
yeah the right hand corner far right
yeah
how big is it without um
the wav files and stuff
'cause i could just say at um going over s c p  one night and just leave it going all night if i had to
it's yeah i mean the wave data are obviously not gonna get off there completely

really oh right
i'll see if i can s c p  it i suppose
i've got a linux box and a windows box so
broad band
put it on to c d  i can if i get down i can put to c d 
yeah
i'm not sure if there's enough space is how much do we get
really okay
yeah but i can do it from that session can't i you can compress it from a remote session and s c p  it from the same session
do you think
yeah oh no no i was thinking of sshing just into some machine and then just scping it from there
yeah i mean it has to go through the gateway but
can you not do that
mm i see
yeah
so you could just
but th first uh how big are the chunks
how big are the chunks you're looking at
so quite small then so you could just um you could use just the same thing
we used to build the big dictionary you just do that on line 'cause that won't take long to build
a little dictionary that big will it i mean just use the same tool that
we use yeah
yeah
it doesn't need ordered no
um well that's the t are you using t f i d f  for the information density
alright okay
like 'cause frequency would be useful i think but um
depending on the context the size and what we consider a document in the sense of calculating t f i d f 
is gonna change
which might need thinking about
i think it would be useful yeah
well you need the raw frequency as well but um
you also need how many times things occur within each document
and um what we consider a document's gonna depend on our context i think 'cause if we're looking
at the whole lot of meetings we'll consider each meeting a document in sort of terms of this algorithm
and if we're viewing like say just a small topic segment you might look at even each
utterance as a small document
yeah but the thing is um
it's gonna need some th th thought of how we
actually maybe it doesn't actually matter maybe if you just do it once at the highest level it it
will be fine but i was just thinking it might be difficult to calculate the t f i d f  off line for
all the different levels we might want 'cause if we're gonna allow disjoint segments for example
then how are we gonna know what's gonna be in context at any given time but i suppose if you just did
it globally treating a meeting as a document it'd probably still be work out fine
because you'd only be comparing to ones within the context
uh i don't know i thought were you gonna use that in the end
the information density
oh sorry that's what i mean like um yeah for each word or whatever but across the whole lot is what i mean by highest level like across the whole corpus
yeah but you'd probably look at each meeting as a document
mm possibly
are they big enough to get anything meaningful out of
well yeah that is not it's not an issue you just concatenate an x m l  file together but we still want to have like a notion of meetings for the user
yeah sure yeah you just like whatever you want to look at you just jam together into an x m l 
file and that's your meeting even though bits of it may come from all over the place or whatever
i mean i don't see why that's really a big problem
so basically what you're saying is you can take an arbitrary amount of data and process it with the same algorithm it doesn't matter
conceptually what that data is it could be a meeting it could be two utterances it could be
a meeting plus half a meeting from somewhere else
i don't think it's very difficult though i mean what you do is you just build an x m l  file and if you want it to get down to the utterances
you'd go to the leaves and then if you wanted the next level up you'd go to the
parents of those and like just go from like the leaves inwards towards the branch
to build up things like um you know when you click on a segment it's gonna have like words or
whatever that are important
as long as like the algorithms are designed um with it in mind i don't think it's a very big problem
well like say you had um like say for a meeting right you've got like uh say a hierarchy that looks quite big like this
and like the utterances come off of here maybe
then when whatever your algorithm is doing as long as when you're working with utterances you go for all the leaves
like then if you need something next up so like a topic segment you'd go to here
but if you were looking at say this one so only went like this
right so you it's same you'd start with the leaves and you go oh i want a topic segment so i go one layer up
see and then if you're working with just a topic segment in there it's the only thing you have to worry about and like each time you want a higher level you just need to go up the tree and as long as your algorithm respects that then we can just
process any arbitrary x m l 
file with whatever hierarchical structure we want
a meeting say and that would be a topic segment
so i think as long as you build an algorithm that respects whatever structure's in the file rather than imposing its own structure
well no it doesn't have to be
but i mean it could be as many nodes as you want like this one could be deeper maybe
say so then you'd start with all your utterances here and when you go up to get topic segments you go to here here here here here here here
that might be a bit confusing though 'cause you have things on different levels
well wednesday yeah
yeah
so we'll see if we can get like a mini browser just displays two things synched together of some kind yeah yeah
it'd be useful i don't know who you see about that though
i d have no idea
i've probably got a reasonable amount because um everything on my dice account can actually be deleted 'cause i store it all at home as well
is that guaranteed to stay the
maybe you should send a support form
just say we want some web space
listen to
yeah 'cause that'd be really useful is if we had a big directory especially for transferring stuff
having said that are we allowed to take a copy of the icsi corpus something we should probably ask before we do it
okay
okay
no me neither
might be funny to see what is summarised the whole corpus as anyway i think it'd be very useful but

we can just change the code
is that it that's quite good
yeah
i could just use it with the frequency i think until the information density thing's finished that would be really useful
if you're doing it in java could you um serialize the output as well as writing it to a file if you're doing it in java could you serialize the um dictionary yeah as well as writing it to a file
it's really easy
i don't see why it'd be any more massive than the file
yeah
it just saves you parsing the um
file representation of it and now 'cause i would be using it in java anyway so i'd just be building the data structure again
yeah but it seems like a bit silly to be parsing it over and over again kinda thing
i would've thought that um i think all the collections and things implement serializable already
i think they might do
tonight i'll try and um i'll either work some more on uh the t f i d f  summarizer or do the audio thing
yeah
do we have to demonstrate something next week

yeah
yeah i know
i think it's 'cause we had to specify it ourselves that it's not as um like focus the specification of most um work we have to do
yeah
once we start doing it it will all become more or less obvious i think anyway
'kay
gosh
'kay
is there much more in it than he d
is there much more in it than he said yesterday
mm
hmm hmm
yeah now i'd say if for the prototype if we just like wherever possible p chunk in the stuff
that we have um pre annotated and stuff and for the stuff that we don't have pre annotated write like a stupid baseline
then we should probably be able to basically that means we focus on on the interface first sort of so that we we take the
the ready made parts and just see how we get them work together in the interface the way we want and and then we have a working prototype and then we can go back
and replace pieces either by our own components or by more sophisticated compo po components of our own
so it's probably feasible the thing is i'm away this weekend so that's
for me
oh yeah um yeah no but also i might like the the similarity thing like my just my matrix itself
for my stuff i c i i think i can do that fairly quickly because i have the algorithms yeah i think today's meeting
is really the one where we where we sort of settle down the data structure and as soon as we have that uh probably like after today's
meeting we then actually need to
well go back first of all and look at nite x m l  to see in how far that that which we want is compatible with that which nite x m l  offers us and then just sort of everyone make sure everyone understand the interface
so i think if today we decide on what data we wanna have now and and later
maybe even today we go and look at nite x m l  or some of us look at nite x m l  in a bit more detail just trying to make some sense of that code
and see how does the representation work in their system and then sort of with that knowledge we should be able to then say okay that
type of nite x m l  data we wanna load into it and this is how everyone can access it and then
we should be able to go from there
no
i've looked looked at the documentation and n like seen enough to make me think that we want to use the nite x m l  framework
because um they have a good a event model that synchronizes sort of the data and and every display
element so that takes a lot of work away from us sort of that would be a reason for staying within their framework and using their general
classes but beyond that i haven't looked at it at all which is something we should really do
who actually like for this whole discussion i mean who of us is doing stuff that is
happening on line and who of us is doing stuff that's happening off line like my data is coming c
hmm
yeah
okay
okay
'kay
so basically apart from the display module the i the display itself we don't have an extremely high
degree of interaction between sort of our modules that create the stuff and
and the interface so the interface is mainly while it's running just working on data that's just loaded from a file
i guess
there isn't
yeah i know th yeah the search is i guess the search is sort of a strange beast anyway because for the search we're leaving the nite x m l  framework
um but that's still sort of that's good that means that at least like we don't have the type of situation where
somebody has to do like a billion calculations on on data on line
'cause that would make it a lot more like that would mean that our interface for the data would have to be a lot more careful about how it performs and
and everything and nobody is modifying that data at at on line time at all it seems nobody's making
any changes to the actual data on line
so that's actually making it a lot easier that basically means our browser really is a viewer mostly which isn't doing much with the data except for sort of selecting a piece piece of it and and displaying it
hmm
well some parts relevant for the search yes i'd say so
hmm
yeah but nobody of us is doing much of searching from the data in the on line stage
and for all together like the display itself i think we are easier if we if it's sitting on the x m l  than if
it's sitting on the s q l  stuff because if it's sitting on the x m l  we have the the nite x m l  framework with
all its functionality for synchronizing through all the different levels
whenever there's a change whenever something's moving forward and stuff and we can just more or less look at their code like how their player moves forward and how that moving
forward is represented in different windows and stuff so i think in the actual browser itself i don't wanna sit on the
s q l  if we can sit on the x m l  because sitting on the x m l  we have all we have so much help and for y
for like the p the calculations that we're doing apart from the search it seems that everyone needs some special representations
anyway
you mean our results yeah in in the nite x m l  x m l  format so with their time stamps and stuff so that it's easy to to tie together st things
what i'm like what we have to think about is if we go with this multi level idea like this idea
that sort of if you start with a whole meeting series as one entity as one thing that you display
as one whole sort of that then the individual chunks of the individual meetings
whereas and then you can click on a meeting and then sort of the meeting is the whole thing and the chunks are the individual
segments that means sort of we have multiple levels of of representation which we probably
if we if we do it this way like we f we have to discuss that if we do it this way then we should probably find some abstraction model so
that the interface in the sense like deals with it as if it's same so that the interface doesn't really have to worry whether
it's a meeting in the whole meeting series or a segment within a meeting you know what i mean and that's
probably stuff that we have to sort of like process twice then like for example that like the summary of a meeting
within the whole meeting corpus or meeting series y is meeting series a good word for that i don't really know what how to call it you
know what i mean like not not the whole corpus but every meeting that has to do with one topic um
so in in the meeting se series so that a summary for a meeting within the meeting series are sort of
compiled off line by a summary module and that is separate from a summary of a segment within a meeting 'cause i don't think we can

so are we doing that at all levels are we um
and just have different like fine grainedness levels sort of
mm
'kay so the only thing that yeah so the only thing that would happen basically if i double click let's say from the whole meeting series on a single meeting is that the zoom level changes like the th the start and the end position changes and the zoom level changes
i i thought we couldn't do that like i was under the impression that we couldn't do that because we couldn't load the data for all that
but i don't know i mean that
so i'm s not sure if i got it i was
mm hmm mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
okay
so
okay i wa i was just worried about the total memory complexity of it but i i completely admit i mean i just sort of like th took that from some thing that jonathan once said about not loading everything but maybe i was just wrong about it how many utterances w
yeah and i w yeah yeah yeah yeah so what we have is we would have a word
like we would have words with some priority levels and they would basically be because even the selection
would would the summaries automatically feed from just how prioritized an individual word or how indiv uh prioritized
an individual utterance is or i are the summaries sort of refined from it and made by a machine to make sentences
and stuff or are they just sort of taking out the words with the highest priority and then the words of the second highest priority
and the u okay
are we doing it on th the whole thing on the utterance level or are we doing it on word level like the information density calculation
we i think we have start and end times for words actually but it's yeah but it m it might s but it might sound crazy in the player we should really maybe we can do that together at some point today that we check out how the player works but there's maybe some merit in altogether doing it on an utterance level in the end
so
yeah
well but also about the displays i mean the displays in the in the text body in the in the latest draft that we had sort of we came
up with the idea that it isn't displaying utterance for utterance but it's also displaying uh a summarised version
in you know like below the below the graph the part maybe
yeah r
hmm
oh yeah f it's just like there there's like audio skimming and there's displayed skimming
yeah ma maybe there's some merit of going altogether for utterance level and not even bother to calculate
i mean if you have to do it internally then you can do it but maybe like not even store the importance levels for individual words and
just sort of rank utterances as a whole
hmm
yeah
'cause it it might be better skimming and less memory required at the same time and i mean if you if you know how to do it for individual words then you can just in the worst case if you can't find anything else just sort of make the mean of the words over the utterance you know what i mean
w it's it's
well what's the smallest chunk at the moment you're thinking of of assigning an importance measure to is it a word or is it an utterance
so we're thinking of like maybe just storing it on a per utterance level
because it's it's less stuff to store probably for dave in the in the audio playing and for in the display it's probably better if you have whole utterances than
i don't know like what it's like if you just take single words out of utterances that probably doesn't make any sense
at all whereas if you just uh show important utterances but the utterance as a whole it makes more sense so it doesn't actually make a difference for your algorithm 'cause it
just means that if you're working on a word level then we just mean it over the utterance
they are on
oh so that's good anyway then yeah because that makes it a lot easier than to t put it on utterance level
oh yeah no but i mean like how how jasmine does it internally i don't know but it's probably yeah you probably have to work on word levels for importance but there should be ways of easily going from a word level to an utterance level okay
yeah prob
hmm
well we do a pre filtering of sort of the whole thing sort of like but that like the problem with that is it's easy to do in the text level but that would mean it would still play the uh in your audio unless we sort of also store what pieces we cut out for the audio
yeah i think before we can like answer that specific question how we c deal with that it's probably good for us to look at what the audio player is capable of doing
yes
so what do you mean by buffering like you think directly feeding
but yeah but not but not stored on the hard disk and then loaded in but loaded in directly from memory
but it's probably a stream if it exists in java it would be probably some binary stream going in of some type okay yeah
okay okay so i mean so that means that there's probably even if you go on an per utterance level there's still some
merit on within utterances cutting out stuff which clearly isn't relevant at all and that maybe also for the audio we'd have to do so let's
say we play the whole au phrase but then in addition to that we have some information that says minus that
part of something that's okay that we can do
yeah maybe even i mean that's sort of that depends on how how advanced we get if maybe if we realise that there's massive
differences in in gain or in something you can probably just make some simple simple normalization but that really depends on how much time we have
and and how much is necessary yeah if like i d i don't know anything about audio and i have never seen the player so if you find that
the player accepts some n input from memory and if it's easy to do then i guess that's that's fairly doable so but that means
in the general structure we're actually quite lucky so we we have we load into memory for the whole series of meetings
just the utterances and rankings for the utterances and some information probably that says well
the i guess that goes with the utterance who's speaking
because then we can also do the display about who's speaking
yeah
but i'm i'm still confused 'cause i thought like that's just what jonathan said we do c that we can't do like load a massive document of that size on the other hand
the other hand i mean it shouldn't be like should be like fifty mega byte in ram or something it shouldn't be massive should it actually fifty hundred megabyte is quite big in ram
just thinking what's the simp so
we do get an error message with the project if we load everything into the project with all the data they load so we know that doesn't work so our hope is essentially that we load less into it what's this lazy loading thing somebody explain lazy loading to me
ah okay so that is that only by type of file like if if if the same thing is in different files
would it then maybe like you know if if utterances are split over three or ten
or w hundred different files is then a chance maybe that it doesn't try to load them all into memory at the same time but just
so why does it fail then in the first place then it shouldn't ever fail because then it should never
yeah but yeah but um it uh it it failed right when you load it right the nite x m l  kit so that's interesting
hmm
let's check that out um i'll p i'll probably ask jonathan about it so alternatively if
we realise we can't do the whole thing in one go we can probably just process some sort of meta data you know what
i mean like sort of sort of for the whole series
chunks representing the individual meetings or some
like something that represents the whole series in in a v in a structure very similar to the structure
in which we represent individual um meetings but with data sort of always
combined from the whole series so instead of having an single utterance that we display it would probably be like
that would be representing a whole um topic a segment in a meeting
and sort of so that wi using the same data st
well in a sense
uh i'm i'm thinking of in a sense of like creating a virtual a virtual meeting out of the whole meeting series sort of
yeah sort of like off line create a virtual meeting which which basically treats the meeting series as if it was
a meeting and treats the individual meetings within the series as if they were segments and treats the individual
segments within meetings as if they were um utterances you know so we just
sort of we shift it one level up and in that way we could probably use the same algorithm and just like make
vir like one or two ifs that say okay if you are on a whole document uh a whole series level and that was a double click
then don't just go into that um segment but load a new file or something like it but in general use the same algorithm
that would be an alternative if we can't actually load the whole thing and
'cause also like even if we maybe this whole like maybe i'm worrying too much about the whole series in one thing display because actually i mean probably users wouldn't view that one too often
yeah but i'm i'm still worried like for example for the display if you actually if you want a display uh like
for the whole series the information density levels based on and and the f and the only granularity
you have is individual utterances that means you have to through every single utterance in a series of seventy
hours of meetings
yeah yeah and if you make that structurally very similar to the the le like one level down like the way how we uh store individual utterances and stuff then maybe we can more or less use the same code and just make a few ifs and stuff
yeah so so but still so in in general we're having we're having utterances
and they have a score
and that's as much as we really need and of cou and they also have a time a time information of course hmm and a and a s and a speaker information yeah
yeah so an information which topic they're in yeah and and probably separate to that an information about the different topics like that
yeah
so
so the skimming can work on that because the skimming just sort of sorts the utterances and puts as many in as it needs
yeah yeah it'll it'll play them in some order in which they were set because otherwise it's gonna be more entertaining um
but that that's enough data for the skimming and the the searching so what the searching does is the searching leaves
the whole framework goes to the s q l  database and gets like basically in the end gets just
a time marker for where that is like that utterance that we are concerned with and then we have to find i'm sure there's
some way in in nite x m l  to just say set position to that time mark and then it shifts the whole frame and it
alerts every single element of the display and the display updates
yeah yeah that we can ju yeah but so so if if somethi so yeah so if in that tree display somebody clicks on something
yeah and then you sort of feed the time stamp to and the nite x m l  central manager and that central manager alerts everything
that's there like alerts the skim like the the audio display alerts the text display alerts the visual display and says we
have a new time frame and then they all sort of do their update routines with respect to the current level of zoom so how much
do they display and starting position at where the or maybe the mid position of it i don't know
like w if start where the thing was found or if that thing wa was found it's in the middle of the part that we display that i don't know but
that we can decide about but a general sort of
it's the same thing if like whether you play and it moves forward or whether you jump to a position through search it's essentially
for all the window handling it's the same event it's only that the event gets triggered by the search routine which
sort of push that into nite x m l  and says please go there now
why do we have to do it in memory but that stuff's so
i mean like the information is coming from off line
so we probably we don't even have to change the utterance document right because the
whole way like the whole beauty of the nite x m l  is that it ties together lots of different files so we can just create an additional x m l  file which for every utterance like
the utterances have i d s i presume some references so we just we tie uh p just a very short
x m l  file which it's the only information it has that has whatever a number for for the
um weight for the information density and we just tie that to the existing utterances and tie them to the existing speaker
changes
well otherwise we probably have to go over it and like add some integer that we just increment
from top to bottom sort of to every utterance as an as an i d  some type or un or try to understand how nite x m l 
i d s work and maybe there's some special route we have to follow when we use these i d s it's alm
hmm
yeah the the girl said the utterances themselves are not numbered at the moment
okay okay okay yeah so i guess that would be solvable if not
mm hmm
sorry
okay
okay
is that a board marker pen actually
oh that's just so like to make a list of all this stuff or we probably can somebody can do it on paper
all these fancy pens so what so the stuff we have we have utterances
and speakers and weights for utterances so for for every utterance
sort of like the utterance has a speaker and a weight which is coming from outside or we just tie it to it
and there is segments which hmm
oh so sorry um uh topic s topic segments i meant like they are they are a super unit so so the utterances are tied to topic segments
and if the time stamps are on a word level then we b somehow have to extract time stamps for utterances where they start
w what segments now
okay is the uh is that the same as utterances that is that the same as utterances that
mm hmm mm hmm
what so that's oh but that's one o one segment or is that two segments then
yeah
okay okay so but but generally utterances is that which we just called uh sorry segments is that which we just called utterances now like it's it's the sa it's sort of like one person's contribution at a time sort of thingy dingy
okay so yeah so we have those and and then we have some f field somewhere else which has
topics
yeah and and a topic's basically they are just on the i d  probably with a start time or something and and the utterances referenced
to those topics i guess so the topics don't contain any redundant thing of like showing the whole topic
again but they just sort of say a number and where they start and where they finish and the utterances then say which topic they
belong to
yeah no but i was thinking of the topic segmentation now and and f for that there would only be one right because it's sort of like it's just a time window
yeah
so if this lazy loading works then this should definitely fit into i mean not memory then because it wouldn't all be in memory
at the same time so if we just have those sort of that information like a long list of all the utterances
slash segments and like short or smaller lists which give weight to them
and even though probably if there's a lot of over head in having two different files we can probably merge the weights into it off line
you know what i mean like if if there's a lot of bureaucracy involved with having two different trees and whether one ties to the other because the one
has the weight for the other then it's probably quicker to just
yeah i thought that was the whole beauty that like you can just make a new x m l  file and sort of tie that to the other and and it tre
oh yeah so no i didn't i didn't mean tree no no i meant just like handling two different files internally sort of c i was just thinking you know like if if the overhead for having the same amount of data coming from two d files instead of from one file is massive
then it would probably be for us easy to just like off line put the the weight into into the file that has the segments uh yeah segments slash utterances already but that we can figure out i mean if it's going horrendously wrong
yeah
yeah yeah no we'd we'd be completely using like the whole infrastructure and basically just i mean the main difference really
between our project and theirs really is that we load a different part of the data but otherwise
we're doing it the same way that they are doing it so we just we're sort of running different types of queries on it we
in a sense we i think we are running queries it's not just about um what we load and what we don't load but we're l
running queries in the sense that we dynamically select by by weights don't we that we have to check
how fast that is like to say give us all the ones that whether that works with their query language whether that's too
many results and whether we shou
you know if 'cause if it i let's say i mean if if their query language is strange and if it would return
b ten million results and it can't handle it then we can just write our individual components in the way that they know which
what the threshold is so they still get all the data and just they internally say oh no this is less than three
and i'm not gonna display it or something
hmm
yeah no i'm just thinking for this whole thing of like a different level sort of cutting out different different pieces
whether we do that through a query where we say give us everything that's ab above this and this weight or
whether we skip the same infrastructure but every individual module like the player and the display say like they still
get sort of all the different utterances uh all the different pieces but they say oh this piece i leave out because it's below the
current threshold level
when do we need the one for the meet
okay yeah i guess for the so when we have the display will we display the whole series then if we have for the individual
topic segments within the meetings if we have ready calculated disp um measures then we don't have to sort of extract that data from the individual
utterances yeah and that's also fairly easy to store along with our segments isn't it for the segments are we extracting
some type of title for them that we craft with some fancy algorithm or manually or we're just taking
the single most highly valued key word utterance for the segment heading
hmm
hmm it's probably like in in the end probably it wouldn't be the best thing if it's just the high most highly ranked phrase or key word because like for example for an introduction that would most definitely not be anything that has any title anywhere similar to introduction or something
yeah
also like for this part maybe if we go over it with named entity in the end if i mean w
if one of the people doing dil has some named entity code to spare and just like at least for the for sort of for
finding topics titles for for segments just take a named entity which has a really high what's
it called d f i d f  whatever 'cause you'd probably be quite likely if they're talking about a conference or a person that that would be a named entity
which is very highly fr um frequented in that part
yeah he said they're quite sparse so that basically was don't bother basing too much of your general calculation on it but like
especially if they're sparse probably individual named entities which describe what a what a segment is about would probably be quite
good like if there's some name of some conference they would could probably say that name of the conference quite often
even though he's right that they make indirect references to it anyway sorry
so you're doing that on a on a per word level
okay
okay
okay cool i was just wondering where you had the corpus from at the moment
so it it seems that the data structure isn't a big problem and that basically we don't have to have all these massive discussions
of how we exactly interact with the data structure because most of our work isn't done with that data structure in
memory in the browser but it's just done off line and everyone can ha represent it anyway they want as long as they sort of store it in a useful
x m l  representation in the end so like
yeah that would mean understanding the nite x m l  x m l  sort of format in a lot more detail we should i think we should just have a long session in the computer room together and like now that we know a bit more what we want take a closer look at nite x m l 
mm hmm
mm hmm
good yeah i haven't looked at this stuff much at all
yeah
yeah
who's who's sort of doing the the the central coordination of of of the browser application now like
hmm
yeah or but also like all these elements like like the loading and yeah integration and and like handling the data loading and stuff
nah i'm sort of like i think i'll take over the display just because i've started with a bit and found it found it doable
so somebody should sort of be the one person who's who understands most about what's t centrally going on with with the with the project like with the with the browser as a whole and where the data comes in and
any volunteers
it's also a complicated one
yeah
i know but uh b i guess we can do it like several people together it's probably just those people have to work together a lot and very closely and just make sure that they're always f understand what the other one is doing
yeah or or ready made versions of them for that matter and
yeah but i think actually like at the moment the integration comes first i mean it's sort of at the moment the building the browser comes first and then only comes the
creating new sophisticated data chunks because that's sort of the whole thing about having a prototype system which is more or less working
on on chunk data but it at least we have the framework in which we can then test everything and and look at everything 'cause before we
have that it's gonna be very difficult for anyone to really see how much the work that they're doing is making sense because you just
well i guess you can see something from the data that you have in your individual x m l  s files files that you create
but it would be nice to have some basic system which just displays some stuff
or just adapt like their like just sort of go from their system and and adapt that piece for piece and see how we could
how we could arran like adapt it to our
system
does anyone want to like just sit with me and like play for three hours with nite x m l  at some point
uh i wouldn't like to be 'cause i'd like to go to the gym i'm theoretically free but if there's any time t hmm
you have nothing no free time on wednesday
hmm
nine 'til twelve and then nothi you have or you
hmm
anytime wednesday afternoon i'd be cool i think
yo forrest hill whatever one's easier to discuss stuff i don't know
i'm not biased
okay what time do you wanna do
okay so i'll just meet you in in eighteen a in the afternoon
i guess at the moment nobody critically depends on like the nite x m l  stuff working right now
right like at the moment you can all do your stuff and i can do my l s a  stuff and i can even do the display
to a vast degree without actually having their supplying framework working so it's not that crucial
yeah actually i need the raw text as well yeah but i was i was i was more thinking of the sort of the the whole browser framework as a running programme now yeah i think we all need the raw text in different in different flavours don't we

but number within the x m l  context
are they spoken numbers like do they look like they're utterances numbers there's the number task isn't there that's part of the whole thing hmm
okay
hmm yeah we have to probably cut that out anyway for our project i don't know it's probably gonna screw up a lot of our data otherwise
if not sure if it what it does to document
it would probably make the yeah if if you have segments for that probably the
okay uh i'm just thinking like it pro it pro probably like the l s a  would perform quite well on it it would
probably find another number task quite easily seeing that it's a constrained vocabulary with a high co occurrence
of the same nine words so that wou ten word hmm
yeah
i think it's also something that they they said the numbers in order right
yeah i think it's it the it sounded like they wanted to check out how well they were doing with overlapping and stuff because basically it's like
they're reading them at different speeds but you know in which order they are said anyway
icsi has some reasons for doing it they must have been pissed off saying like numbers
at the end of every meeting
um dave if you would or actually for well if you're doing i d f s
or you whatever you call your your frequencies i always mix up the name uh you need some dictionary for that at some
point though like you need to have some representation of a word as not not that specific occurrence
of that word token but of of of a given word form because you're making counts for word forms right yeah so we should
work together on that because i need a dictionary as well
okay
'kay
okay didn't you say that the o the ord
yeah but for i'm just wondering for the whole thing does somebody wo who was it of you two who said that um there's some programme which spits out a dictionary probably with frequencies
okay is anyone of you for the for the document frequency over total frequency you gonna have total frequencies of words then with that right like over the whole corpus sort of or

w using which tool are you talking about
be careful with that like my experience with the british national corpus was that there's far more word types than you ever think
because anything that's sort of unusual generally is a new word type like any typo or any strange
thing where they put two words together and also any number as a word type of its own so you can easily end up with hundred thousands of words when you didn't expect
them so generally dictionaries can grow bigger then you think they do
well you can probably also you can probably pre filter like with regular expressions even just say if it consists of only dig digits then skip it or even if it consists any special characters then skip it because it's probably something with a dot in between which is usually not something you wanna have and
what i did for my project i just ignored the hundred most frequent words because they actually end up all being articles and and everything and stuff
so we need like several of us need a dictionary am i the only one who needs it with frequencies
am i the only one who needs it with frequencies or
frequencies yeah well i guess as soon as we have the raw text we can probably just start with the java hash map and like
just hash map over it and see how far we get i mean we can probably on a machine with a few hundred megabyte ram you can go quite far
you can write it on beefy so even if it goes wrong and even if it has a million words be
oh yeah burning it on a like we should be able to burn the whole corpus just the x  hmm ah i see
i asked support about that two days ago in the informatics building there oh
sorry in in appleton tower five the ones closest t two machines closest to the support office so i presume
oh wait i have the exact email i think he's talking about sort of the ones that
yeah if you if you enter the big room in the right hand corner i think um the thing is like you can only
burn from the local file system so if it's from s well actually i think if it's mounted you can directly burn from there but the problem
is i have my data on beefy and so i have to get it into the local temp directory and burn it from there but you can burn it from there
uh we looked that up and i for we looked that up and i forgot
yeah yeah no you you we should be able to get it at i don't think it was i don't think it was a gigabyte
hmm
see i would off i would offer you to to get it on this one and then um like copy it but you know what i figured out i'm quicker
down loading over broad band into my computer than using this hard disk there's something strange about the way how they access the hard disk how they
mount it which is unfortunate
hmm what operating system do you have
okay wh what connection do you have at home
yeah so if anyone of us gets it we can then just use an ext hmm yeah burn it to c d  or yeah put it on on hard disk whatever
question is if you're not quicker if you uh because you should get massive compression out of that like fifty percent or something with a good algorithm so if you could compress it and just put it into a temp directory like
the temp the temps usually have for gigabyte three or two the temps yeah i do like i mean there's not guarantee that anything stays there but overnight it'll stay and i think the temps usually have
ah yeah but that would have to be the temp directory off the machine you can s s h  into directory of s s h 
yeah they wou they'd they'd probably hate you for doing it but
they'd probably they'd like you more if you s s h  uh into another computer compress it there and then sort of copy it into the into the gateway machine
they have um if you s s  hey you know if you if you s s h  and they have this big warning about doing nothing at all in the gateway machine
yeah
to your home machine
i haven't i haven't figured out how to tunnel through the gateway into another machine yet it's not it's not easy definitely
that's why i end up sort of copying stuff into the temp directory at the gateway machine sorry if this is boring everybody else this is just details
and how to get stuff home from what we can probably just look at that together when we're meeting
i'm sorry
mm hmm
well yeah
as soon as somebody gives me the raw text of the whole thing i can probably just implement like a five line java hash table frequency dictionary builder and see
oh did you not say frequencies f of words in the whole sorry did uh
so you'd you

yeah you'd have to count it yourself yeah
oh you don't wanna have different counts for each chunk but just like sort of for for something from old chunks
oh yeah no that's yeah so once i write an ar like w if i write like an algorithm which does a hash
um table dictionary with frequency from a raw text then the raw text can be anything so
how far are we g uh how f how far are you getting raw text out of it do you think
okay well that's good because for the dictionary the order doesn't make a difference does it so yeah so um i'll get
that from you and i'll write the hash table which goes over that and creates a dictionary file so for the dictionary is it okay if i do whatever
word blank frequency or something just p could everybody sort of start from that i mean i guess we can
yeah i i need frequency as well
well i think we might have a lot in common what we calculate because i for my latent semantic analysis need like counts of words within a document uh within a a segment actually within a topic segment
can i convert these probabilities back into frequencies
okay
oh so that's what f rainbow does because that's what l s a  builds on like it builds a f a document by frequency matrix so i could probably get that even though but i already have i already have my code to build it up myself no don't bother i have my code already um
yeah so dave you said you need the frequency counts actually for per document would you say not for the whole thing
it more and more appears to me that if we if we scrap the notion of the meeting as an
individual thing and sort of ju see meetings as as topic
segments and have sort of like hierarchical topic segmentation instead then it's b like a more coherent framework
wait are we are we using this um for the for the for the do for the weighting in the end now this this measure you're calculating
because if we're doing like i think for for the information density we uh we should calculate it on the lowest level not on the highest but like 'cause
yeah but w it don't you have to like go sort of like for in a document versus the whole thing isn't that how it works that you c look look at r
i don't think that's a good idea because isn't it like that we expect th there to change over i b with the different topic segments more that they talk about something different in each different topic segment
'cause that's what relative term frequency is about that like in some context they're talking more about a certain word than in general so that would more be the the topic segments then
i don't know
yeah
yeah yeah
so i'm just wondering if there's ways to abandon the whole concept of of meetings and sort of but just not really treating separate meetings as too much of a separate entity but
but on algorithmic level whether we actually whether there's some way to just represent meetings as as topics
hmm
that's not really what i meant but i think i have to think more about what i meant
um g i'm confused about everything
yeah
i'm i'm not so concerned about the m a meeting plus something else i'm more talking about like yeah the keeping keeping the same algorithm and
the same way of handling it and just saying like just this this
topic here i uh it happens to be like a whole meeting and it has sort of sub topics so just that sort of topics
a hierarchical concept where like a topic where there can be super topics
and topics and the super topics are in the end what the meetings are but in general at some level super topics are treated like
like topics
hmm
mm i'm not really sure what i want
so sorry could describe that again the
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
so that would be the series as a whole that would be sort of m meetings yeah
yeah i'm a i'm a i'm a bit brain damaged at the moment but i think i'll just sit together with you again and and go through it again
hmm
so so i'll is th it like is this and this structurally then always identical so that we can that we can treat it with the same algorithm or
yeah i'm also not sure how we can go from from bottom up i have always thought it's like more that oh whatever i'm a can't think of it at the moment
probably this is all too complicated worrying about that at that moment anyway

now have have we have we decided anything are we doing anything s wednesday we are meeting and looking at their at their implementation in some more detail to actually understand what's going on
we had two things from their stuff just to make sure that we are like understand it we understand it enough to to m modify it
yep how would we do that by just making like it w read write for everyone
'kay who has most free space on their
same here
well we alternatively we can probably just make another directory on the beefy scratch space i mean that's where i'm having gigabytes and gigabytes of stuff at the moment
no no
yeah
but i think if he sends to the i think if he sends to the port he'd probably be in a better position yeah
hmm
i think he said yes to that i think uh that was like in when we were still in the seminar room i asked that once or like ask is it possible
to get it off and nobody said like people were discussing about the technical practicalities but nobody said
anything about al being allowed to or not allowed to i mean we have access to it here and i guess it
probably means that we we can't give it to anybody else but
but if they give us access to it here o sitting on a dice machine then there shouldn't be a reason why we shouldn't be able to use it on our laptop i personally don't have too many friends who would be too keen on getting it anyway
i have that really excited pirate copied thing it annotated meeting data
huh
wait wait wait um sorry yeah sorry
what i just realised we should really t keep different serieses completely separate for virtually all purposes just let's be careful about that because
like the the icsi corpus isn't isn't one meeting series it's several meeting series with different people meeting for completely different things
for each meeting
alright
okay but like let's just be careful that whatever we sort of we merge together that like the highest level of merging it's not the whole icsi corpus but individual series
i think we might actually i think that's probably be somewhere like well
or something like it um i think we might just get away with for the whole project just like looking
at only one series and just doing within one series i mean you can do everything you want in one series
oh yeah let's take that
is the is the data always clearly split up by different series uh like is it easy to just pick one
okay
okay
okay
okay so at at every level everyone has to be careful to really just take even at the highest level
just take stuff from one series and not merge stuff from different series together because they would probably be just majorly messy
yeah so so t so like if even if we make one single text file which has the whole corpus
sort of our corpus that would still be from one series only wou but it what you're producing at the moment is like individual
text files that sort of have the raw text for a whole a meeting as a whole or
mm hmm
yeah
'kay um so is is anybody creating an uh a real raw text thing at the moment like which is just the words
yeah tha 'cause that's what i'm gonna need as well
but i but if there uh b aren't like so it's it's start and end times just for the file like is it just the first and the last line or is it for every single thing in
so what do you mean by just not print out that
okay
if you're into it can you make a text file which just like makes just the words 'kay do you
want it straight flowing 'cause i would need something that marks the end of uh of uh is is yours
segmented by topics then that like is there any information that you have to the topic to the automated topic topic segmentation
oh then i need something different later anyway okay but for now if you c
okay you're gonna put that as an output of yours the segmentation okay so for now can you create like sort of just uh a dump which is pure text just pure text so that i can get a dictionary and you can work on that for your topic segmentation and
or for for the series but i can but i can also deal with separate files i mean i can just write the algorithm that it loads all files in a directory or something but i mean if you
but if you can put it in one single mega file that would be quite useful for me
even though for you wouldn't it be easier if you had different files because then you sort of know like
yeah so give m give me different files as long as like it m if you could name them in a way that is easy to enumerate over them like whatever one two three four five or something or just anything that i can
yeah is is it something that's easily enu like to enumerate over is it some just some ordered pattern okay cool
okay cool yeah
in the right order
it's just a wish list orders
when do you think you'll have um like a primitive segmentation by some ready made topic segmentation by some ready made tool ready
okay
okay cool 'cause i'll need that then when it's done
okay
mm hmm
what's what's nine megabyte the the
that sounds quite reasonable that's nine nine characters over okay
okay okay that is for are we are we picking one particular series at the moment or
yes
okay
yeah yeah i guess we can probably process the data for all different series and then check which series is the best for the
presentation it sounds quite reasonable nine megabyte i mean if you think if it's r roughly a million
words and nine characters per word sounds realisti
yeah
yes i'm gonna build a dictionary then from that like just a list of the words that maybe a list of the words
with the frequencies or a list of the words sorted alphabetically or numerically what what does
anyone want does this there any wishes for dictionaries
so i'll create a dictionary
add add the structure yeah and then the actual file we can probably like copy from your home directory or something like it
yeah yeah but i'm sa i'm saying for the whole thing in the end then like the big thing we probably shouldn't do by email
yeah
oh from the time i get the file i can do that in an afternoon the next sort of the next morning oh you mean how long processing time it takes
ah it's a it's a bog standard algorithm i've i've sort of i've written it for for dil just in half an hour or something similar
it's just you put them in a hash table and and say well if it exists already in the hash table then you increase the count by one and
i'll probably implement some filter for filtering out numbers or something
really how do you do that
okay well i don't know any perl i mean if anyone wants to do a perl script for that that does it does it nicely i uh
i've no problem with that i but i think i have the java code virtually ready because for dil i wrote something very similar like for dil i wrote something that counts the the different occurrences of all the tags um
sorry
the hash table
uh i've never serialized anything
wouldn't that be absolutely massive though
and then seriali and then write the serialization to a file so you want like a se like a file which is the serialization of a hash table
okay
yeah i i'll i'll check if i understand how it works i mean otherwise i can give you the code for loading a dictionary give you my my it's just it's it's sort of it's a line break separated file you know
yeah
yeah i'll see if i understand how to serialize there's a there's a serialise command so that gives me one mega mother of a s
yeah but do they automatically write to the file anyway i'll i'll figure that out we don't have to
yes is that pretty much
pretty much it
so dave and me look at how nite x m l  works and we're
hmm
i'll build a dictionary as soon as i get the text
and yeah so that
when do we have to meet again then with this
how are we gonna do a demonstrator next week my god
no no not demonstrate but like didn't you say that uh didn't we sort of agree that it would be useful to have a demonstrator of it like some primitive thing working next week
that's gotta be very prototype

mm hmm ah well let's go sorry

i feel like like hanging mid air and not really like finding a point where you can get your teeth into it and start working properly and so it's all so fuzzy the whole
yeah but it at the moment but at the moment it's also an implementational level like with the data structures i'm just like over these vague ideas of some trees i'm f
yeah it's just we are half way through the project time table that's just what freaks me out
um
so we can start
suppose i have to do my presentation eh um
so i'll present myself i'm ada longmund and as you may know it i'm the pr project manager
so um we will have to
um speak about m the project our project project is to create um
a new remote control and as you may know there's lot of industrials interesting
in creating a remote control so the remote control has to be original trendy
and um user friendly
record
so the project method is the following
so if we're um the functional design you have to do uh any individual work
and uh also work with uh meetings talking
with each other uh it will be the same for the conceptual design and
also the same for the detailed design
uh
the tool training is to try out the white board so
maybe you can draw your favourite animal
and make a list of its favourite characteristics
i don't know if we have to do it now maybe later later
so the selling price of the product will be twenty five euros yeah yeah i think it's quite good price yeah and uh
it will uh be a
an international remote control as we want to sell it in the entire world
and the product costs will be not more than twelve euros and fifty centimes
so as you will discuss about the remote control you will have to experience your
um with the remote control um just uh
maybe be imaginative with remote const con controls try to create something new
and people would like to to buy
and and the next meeting will start in thirty minutes
so you'll ha all have your spethisfispis specif specific role and you know i suppose
you know what you have to do and uh you will have to work on the design
and also to work on the design of th technical fun functions
of the remote control and think of the user requirement specifications
yeah
i d  yeah
so
so i will manage all all the group
so you have questions
so you all know what the parts of the work you have to do
mm hmm and you
mm okay
hmm

i suppose you have to design it and you have to take care of the industrial way to transform it
and i maybe you will transform it
maybe it is the outside and the inside
and yeah
and when designing y the remote control just remember that uh it has to be a kind of international product
so you don't have to do something really specific as everybody everybody will have to use it it's sor
the same as keyboards you know you have qwerty azerty french and u k  keyboard so
really the remote control to be international and not too expensive
as we want to maximise the benefit
yeah you have to keep in mind that the product cost won't be maxim more than twelve dot fifty euros
and to be sure that really people will be interested in buying a new remote control with maybe new functionalities that don't exist in the mm existing remote controls now
so is it okay

so you think we have to do it now
you want me to draw something product manager okay let's go i will try

no a mouse is not too difficult mouse is okay
you love the eyes
yeah that was the eyes
a clown rabbit

it's a rabbit
yeah
thank you

you forgot the chips

fish and chips
of
oh


oh yeah
yeah i think yeah
just have to
present project discuss a little bit about it
yeah
so if you have questions
it's okay you know your job you know your job
you know your job
okay
so yeah i think you can do it

twenty five euros

yep
yeah
that's me
okay

yeah
no i'm user interf i'm user interface design
okay so what's the difference between
user interface design d industrial design
yeah i think so
okay so i make uh u user interface you you de you implement the core functions in the
use it
make make yeah
maybe i think uh uh i industrial design's uh it's the function design i design the user f user interface you design the function
yeah
okay
yeah yeah
okay
okay
mm hmm
yeah
mm
yeah
okay
yeah and uh simple
and easy to use
ah yeah
okay
okay
okay
yeah
yeah yeah you try try first

you can draw something which is very simple
oh maybe we should bring kemy here kemy is really good at drawing
you're going to draw
okay

what's this
it's a fat cat

can you draw uh um rabbit oh hat ha rat
yeah
yeah it's okay
mm
okay
oh okay i draw the only thing i can draw is like this
oh
oh oh
no what's this

okay




okay
the only thing i can draw because it's very simple





oh
okay be careful

no problem no problem


a person
dog

okay
okay
so we have break
oh
hmm
no
okay
ah okay
it's ada longmund
maybe someone ha we have to this whiteboard yeah

yeah i don't know
i it's it's reasonable s quite yeah twenty five
is

yeah i i hope so
i d  is for the industrial design yeah
and u i d  it's for the user interface designer yeah
ami yeah project
you will be the manager yeah
i am the industrial design yeah
i am the industrial designer so

it's difficult
you know very soon
so
i i think the user the user interface design is he will design how the user will you know the relation between the user and you know the remote control so
and the uh industrial design it is how the object will look like
yeah so the materi
okay right but i was thinking that he's a user 'cause the user interface to design for example where the but button will be you know
but i don't know okay
i'm the industrial designer
so
okay
so and the marketing expert will
ok okay


it should be


there was a step about drawing something in the in the board i don't know
is it are we supposed to do right now
oh right it's it's from the left to the ri it's
i d i was thinking but i n i'm not sure now
oh
everybody
i think everybody should do it so
it's not matter
so


yeah it's a it's a cat
it is not a fat cat
yeah it is a

yes you have to draw a rat if you want a rat it's your rat
okay go
right but in grow it's everybody has to grow
what are you i don no idea so
it's a rabbit

it's not so bad so

so you don't have a

a fish
that's a that's a fish okay let's try to draw something
have to be really careful
ah it's my turn
okay
so
it's ok so what can i draw some more

no
mm


yeah it's it's a se it's my priority this one
yeah
no
it's a really crazy dog

okay transfer it's a dog in a village

so what are you sug going to do now
it's done
oh my god

yeah it's okay
we have an idea yeah i have an idea of my job so yeah so yeah
yeah

mm hmm

so right now
mm
it's reasonable i think yeah

those things just refer to each of each of us i think ami and okay
okay
okay and marketing expert it's me
you can manage all this yeah
good
um
not really
so which you the industrial designer
okay
yeah
i mean you have to know ah you have to know it
it's your job so i hope you you know what it is
mm
yeah

okay
well you know
oh okay okay not the other one
yeah i'm just go i'm trying to give you some trends about what should be done and what the users would like to have and then thi this would i guess converged to the user interface designer wi and then industrial designer
mm
mm hmm
and you have to keep it under twelve euros and f fifty so
that's the problem
mm it's clear
yeah maybe should go and draw an animal
many
yeah
uh it's the same as mine
it's the fat cat okay
a rat that's difficult
yeah
just go you you the closest to the whiteboard
jus
yeah
a duck
pikachu

oh yeah
bugs bunny one
okay i go
what oh so what else this was my favourite one but
right a fish
oh yeah doesn't look so fine
okay it's your turn

mm

good
i think it's done
yeah
oh we have twenty five minutes for the meeting
okay
know what time is it
no
good
alright so twenty five
so yeah i've
the only the only remote controls i've used usually come with the television and they're fairly basic so uh
mm
but but to sell it for twenty five you need a lot of neat features for sure
yeah yeah
right
uh what do we think a
what do we think a good size would be for this
'cause i i know as you add more buttons to the remote it sometimes gets so big and clunky and there's just like a hundred buttons on it or you could have a really small slim one but then you could lose it easily

right
okay

wait for emails

hmm

slim

uh yeah uh being as a marketing exper expert i will like to say
like before deciding the cost of this remote control or any other things we must see the
market potential for this product like what is the competition in the market what are the available prices of the
other remote controls in the prices what speciality other remote controls are having and
how complicated it is to use these remote controls as compared to other remote controls available in the market
so before deciding or before finalising this project we must discuss all these things
like and apart from this it should be having a good look also because people really li uh
like to play with it when they are watching movies or playing with or playing with their c d  player m p  three
player like any electronic devices they really want to have something good having a good design in their hands
so yes all this

yeah

yep

uh
hmm
uh making a profit of fifty million euros so it's go gonna have to be be pretty damn trendy
yeah yeah
yeah i was thinking that as well i think the the only ones that i've seen that you buy are the sort of one for all type things where they're yeah so presumably that might be an idea to
put into
yeah yeah uh 'cause i mean what uh twenty five euros that's about
i dunno fifteen pounds or so
and that's quite a lot for a remote control
uh huh
mm hmm
okay
the the keyrings yeah yeah okay that's cool

okay

okay
'kay
so we're looking for
'kay we're
sorry carry on
mm hmm
mm hmm
okay
for for uh remember we're trying to make it for twelve euros fifty
okay well right we'll have to um i'll we're k having another meeting in half an hour so um we should all look into a bit
uh oh actually no we'll allocate so you do the looking around at other remote controls
um if you could maybe come up with sort of shapes and suggested shades or whatever
and you could look into um

basically how how it's made i e  like how you make it all in one how what sort of materials are available to you whatever and obviously other instructions will come from the personal coach
which will probably just usurp what i said so
shapes and colours and um basically how to make it attractive
uh
and you look at competition and design cool so we have uh
um



okay groovy and no doubt we'll get um
sorry we'll get um warnings for next meetings as well
okay i shall i can't imagine these are worth
much okay
fashion into electronic okay
mm 'kay
mm hmm
yeah the universal ones yeah
yeah
mm hmm it's about that
mm um well my first thoughts would be most remote controls
are grey or black as you said they come with the t v  so it's normally just your basic grey black remote control functions
so maybe we could think about colour make that might make it a bit different from the rest
at least um and as you say we need to have some kind of gimmick so
um i thought maybe something like if you lose it and you can whistle you know those things
because we always lose our remote control
okay
mm
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah

yeah
yeah
then you lose it yeah kind of um maybe more like a p d a  kind of just hand held like 'cause
yeah no i wasn't no sorry i wasn't thinking of the screen of like a p d a  but
okay
so you want me to look at shapes and everything you said yep
okay
mm hmm
okay
oh no sorry it's okay
okay cool
mm
okay
yeah it's in the it's in the folder yeah
mm
okay this is a brief run through of the um of the technical functions of the remote as um is uh
the the the presentation is uh already slightly obsolete because i had in mind something that would uh
be i be aimed at controlling multiple devices but uh there's still stuff of relevance so
press on i've looked at looked at a num uh couple of other uh remote control models just for an idea of basic design principles um
and wasn't really satisfied by what i saw i have to say so this is more sort of springboard for uh how these could be improved on
um um basically the job of the device is to send commands to an appliance in this case the television
set um to save you getting off your backside um and there's
two main trends in th in the sort of design practice on the one hand and this uh this particularly
relates to its sort of earliest models where with you know i so so many buttons on it so about
the size of the television set um giving you every possible function that the that the device
has the remote control controls and most of these functions are not going to be
used it creates a rather user unfriendly interface and on the other hand there's a
user focused approach that pares things down to just what what is most likely to get used um
with uh a and a and of course there is a certain amount of sort of loss of function here obviously but mostly
that's relatively peripheral functions and so you go for something that's fairly intuitive to use
and um well f the for the most part for t v  remote it's uh tha that would be channel
control and volume um and if you if you if you are wanting to incorporate uh control
of a d v  d v d  or uh
v c r  presumably into that then there's a play pause stop rewind fast forward record so forth um
my own view is that we should definitely be going for a user focused design um but
uh the pro i think the problem with a lot of the sort of user focused designs that are about is that
they sort of make assumptions in advance about what uh what a given user's going to
uh want mo want to do from want it to do most so something
that's uh
something that is more programmable that uh perh perhaps has the full range of functions available to it but you can then specify yourself what you're most likely to want
um so that those are then immediately accessible through fairly minimal number of controls um
i liked ebenezer's idea of including a joystick in that and uh possibly a sort of fairly minimal number of sort of function
buttons and have a disp you then have some sort of basic display on it so that if you're
um sort of cha changing from different modes for the device it'll tell you just exactly what uh
you know each direction of the uh
of the um joystick's going to do or wha or what each function button's going to do um
this is actually a again slightly taking inspiration off of uh games controllers you know the playstation control where you
have four basic function buttons that are just marked with um distinctive uh geometrical
shapes but the and then dependent on what you're doing with it what game and so on um
those uh those functions are then sort of further specified and so it's taking taking the lead from that
um
that's it
mm
mm
mm
i i was thinking that the remote the um sort of default functions for the joystick would be up and down for uh volume left and right for channels
um i think probably for the first couple of hours of using it um but you know muscle memory's a wonderful thing um
and i think and i think that size of uh display was about what i had in mind um though
i mean i w i would say that uh we could probably probably be required to um
mo most of the mobile phone displays you see these days are colour but we should probably try to stick to black and white
si si simply to keep m keep the unit cost down
um i mean colour could be a sort of subsequent development but uh
you know cost a bit of extra money f w w w w w once everyone's got the first you know oh colour's out we'll have to replace
it won't we it does nothing extra
mm
mm
mm i th the thing i like about the uh
the uh joystick is that uh you you you then basically you can then basically put it i mean for for t 
t  for t v  remote alone you could put
um i mean there are like i say the the the main things people do with a t v  remote control is the volume and the channel you can pack all that onto was onto a single control um
but uh but the but then o uh obviously if uh
you know if you i if you wanted to access further functions i you you then get to sort of menu navigation i mean with
things like ch with things like tuning and channels um you know adjusting brightn uh
brightness and fiddly things that no one really bothers with most t v s these days actually
have menus anyway so this would be a fairly rational way of integra
integrating the uh the remote with the device it's controlling um
concern about our market um if we are i mean most of the uh
of the replacement remote market is sort of remote control rationalisation
um you've got twenty different devices in your living room you want one
wo y you want one that'll do the job of all of them um if all you're replacing is
one of the you know however many remotes you have in your living room um you know you still
need separate remotes for everything else i just think that uh possibly mm
mm
mm
does that um would that include um access to say interactive functions on digital or cable
mm hmm
okay
mm
just a thought
um maybe then our market should be t v  manufacturers rather than the public
try and sell it t sell it to them to supply with
um
mm yeah i've seen them
mm
yeah i think that's a good idea
mm
mm yeah
yeah i think that's
yeah
for volume
actually how
actually i would say maybe two two function buttons the y we're now using the menus button
and um and an og and an okay button i mean certainly something i've found with the joystick on mo
the joysticks on mobile phones is that a lot of the time th the device mistakes you trying
to move it in one direction or the other for pushing down for okay
or vice versa and that's really irritating
the o the o the other dis design constraint i think we should bear in mind is that people are you know very much used to
using a remote control one handedly um so we need to make sure that e even with the joystick
you know something that can just sit comfortably in the palm of the hand and have the joystick just controlled by the thumb
oh so so a small speaker you mean

mm hmm blue ones particularly plus that's a nice wee design touch
mm hmm
mm hmm

actually one one wee thought about that um if we do end up trying to market this to television manufacturers then the um then the transmitter could actually be built into the television
yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
you know i think i mean if it w if we get a major television manufacturer to say y oh yeah we'll have that save us the bother then that's you know vast amounts of sales quite quickly
mm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm yeah i thought the uh the d the double arc could perhaps uh be the uh the enter button
no on the desktop you'll find you should find that there's a project documents link
a well actually just there yeah that's it if you dump it in there
your username
okay excellent right hopefully
that's us ready to uh to go so functional design meeting we'll have to flesh
out some of the uh stuff um
we'll start with the minutes of the last meeting not a lot thankfully to say we introduced ourselves
discussed the possibility of a macro facility interac interacting the t v  a bit more um mentioning
of bar code joystick for user manipulation um and ergonomics of the remote control
as well um it's come to my attention
the following teletext has become outdated due to the populat popularity of the internet remote
control should only be used for the t v  um
due for uh time to market and possibly also cost issues um also key is the corporate
image should stay recognisable um f uh your colour and slogan of course
is down at the bottom there um now just to say quickly
uh i would have thought that only being used for a television the macro facility
may now not be required um or at l its functionality
would have been of limited use so to the point in my opinion anyway that it might not be worth pursuing
um if anybody disagrees we can uh definitely say so um
and hopefully we'll just crack on and we'll get everything going um i'd like to if possible hear from our marketing
expert first to help us gain an idea of where we're going to go so um i'll just load up
your presentation from here if you want
yep sorry uh is yours the
oh sorry okay right
uh if you that's all right if you do you want me to just cycle through it for you or
yeah
okay
okay
yep
okay yep
mm hmm
if you could uh
sor if you could speed it up a bit yeah if you could uh speed it up a bit please yeah sorry cool
okay excellent right um
hear from the user interface designer now i think might be an idea um you've got your presentation now is it on the is it okay
technical functions no yeah
okay
okay
okay yeah
right um if we could hear from our industrial engineer or designer
if you look on the desktop you'll find that there's a link to the project folder or project documents if you save it in there we can open it up from here
are you finding it okay or
okay
mm hmm
okay
oh yeah
ah don't worry about it at all mate
okay well oh sorry i'm i'm interrupting you are you is it yeah okay
right um
right we can probably skip that for now so we've had some stuff put forward um
along with the new user requirements
um we've had a lot of kind of input i'd say so far um
i hear what the marketing expert's saying about um voice activated control however
i've got a couple of worries about that the power required um and the ability
to the cost it seems like for uh an embedded system this could cause us issues
um for example you see that there's fairly robust services on uh computers via
uh via voice i b m  do um drag and dictate but these require a lot of memory
and usually um state quite advanced processor requirements um
voice activation could be an interesting idea but i think that our ind
industrial designer would probably upon some research say that it's maybe not feasible um
that's just my view right now however the idea of a joystick and then maybe an l c d  which
has been kind of put forward so far it's almost like having a small
t  not t v  to say but if you can control almost all of the functionality from the display i don't know how much power an l c d  would take but it might be quite low
well literally um if you can imagine the display maybe slightly larger than um those on
a a mobile phone something where you can read an an um fair amount of information traverse
maybe quite a few menus if we maybe used mobile phones as a good example they usually incorporate they have the
keypad and then evr all the other functionality is usually associated inside by traversing around
that could be one possibility um and then we could have like say the common buttons
as you say volume control changing channels
we
i would agree with you
mm hmm that would be my feeling as well i think we could possibly create quite a useful user interface um now i mean i don't sorry go for it
i think it could probably be aimed at most people who've used a mobile and that might be just another way of
saying try to target most people um if we are if we were to follow that
avenue we might be s you know um we're kind of almost relying on their experience with a mobile phone
i suppose but that does cover a very large section of the people out there
um i mean i imagine as well that the actual l c d  and maybe to a certain extent
the joystick as well would be for the additional functionality which maybe doesn't get used as often maybe
it makes it easy for them to figure out how to um change the
channels as in the frequencies and such for reprogramming it um and you can still have the main buttons that allow the
people to turn the machine on and off d up and down it depends i mean maybe we have the fol um
the joystick as a separate one for the other functions then that there's just a a small number of as you were saying
uh buttons that have already been defined so like we go for the nice standard um up and down
for and volume control so that literally anybody can come along pick up the remote and still know what do do
and they can completely ignore most of the functionality which would be for say the o actual
owner of the the t v  and who would normally use the unit i dunno
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
well this is a requirement that we have to stick to i'm afraid this isn't one that i've just arbitrarily decided on
so um this is this is one of the solid ones that has to be obeyed
for now so i can understand your point and i would agree with you but
this is our design spec for now 'fraid to say um
i would say so yes because then we have to be able to control the remote boxes and that is a separate
unit um i think that it i would say that the design spec we've been with is for the television
only for now and until we hear otherwise we should go with just that
okay maybe we'll hear differently but for now
it would be ease of manipulation of certain functions yes um
there is that possibility yes b however i don't know exactly where we'll be going with that but it might not even be the avenue of the marketing expert that might be sales who are not in this meeting
mm hmm
mm hmm
well something else that you brought up was uh the ability to lose a remote which as you said you've
done in fact we've probably all done um i don't know if it's a gimmick or not but have any of you
ever seen those odd little key rings where if you whistle it will beep and you tell you where it is
um
well the other option of course is that um the well i was going to say clapping um
um digital telephones uh for example one unit has of course you
have to have that base unit somewhere where there's a button but maybe it's a button that you attach to the t v  something which
you when you press that it would beep to give its location away on the remote unit and
that could be something could um separate us a bit and that way because we're attaching what would be
a small button to the t v  again say what it would be a small transmitter um
watch battery type scenario i would say or something that if it was problems enough you could actually
even just um i don't power that might be
something that we could look into yep yeah it's uh putting a lot on your shoulders there so i mean that
could be something that separates us a bit from the market as well
so
to go on from here um we have to decide exactly what we're going to do with the remote before we leave this meeting it would be best to say this is what we're going this is the design we're gonna try and get this is how we're gonna make ourselves look unique
do we go for maybe a remote contro uh sorry we're gonna go for a remote control obviously do we go for a small joystick
that would operate say changing channels up and down and then what another button
that would say that it's now being used to manoeuvre round the l c d 
we could use say the left and right for changing channels and the up and down for volume and
okay
mm hmm
vol
volume selection okay yep the teletext we're gambling with and we're gonna say it's dead the way of the dodo
so we well sorry we could maybe even go as far as saying power button small joystick
l c d  and then what maybe is it one more button to say that you're using the menu
system and with the possibility of pushing down on the joystick to say okay
so we're having very very few buttons involved but navigation around a menu for most things
okay
okay
um
okay so um we're actually that sounds like a rough idea do we incorporate the idea of trying to f locate the remote control again via a beeping noise
do you mind looking
the ability to locate it again so that would require a um transmitter
maybe attached to the t v  just so that it says find me and what a basically
a small microphone um on the actual unit can maybe hide it in the base
sorry
some speaker sorry yeah
um
e us we might be better with the sound possibly we could maybe incorporate
th e the true fact considering the cost of an l e d  we could just incorporate it anyway the l e d s can be surprisingly bright now
um
so by the sounds of it with what we're suggesting so far your design um the user interface is still quite open you could go for quite an interesting design because we're only going to have a very few key and you've got
you know a small l c d  joystick e i think it leaves you open to a a potential wide range of
shapes something that can make it stand out slightly um if you could look into what we've
suggested so far the feasibility of um small transmitter um and such
maybe if an l c d  screen requires too much power or such
ebenezer um marketing expert
if yeah if you could maybe as well see what people think about the idea of this minimalist approach that we've taken
where of a joystick to control the very basic functions and then the idea of manipulating
it like you would a mobile i don't know how easy that will be within the time frame but could be something we could maybe look into
okay um any last comments that anybody would like to put forward anything that they think has been missed out bit of a wide open question there of course
feel free to email me if you think that uh we've screwed something up and wanna get it rectified as soon as possible
right
speaker and l e d  for locating um
transmitter
getting the external power source yep that's quite true
um and something that we can can easily be adopted at the last minute as well i'd say
the electronics could be s either placed externally or internally makes no difference to the final product of the actual
remote control so that's good uses maybe gives us a new potential market
'kay
oh one thing that we've almost not talked about at all my apologies for that um user interface we also need to maybe get the slogan in here um it's i'm pointing at my laptop what in god
real reaction and such so um
oh sorry
my apologies no it could well be i've probably missed that um i think that's l almost the last minute
thing we can just incorporate into the actual plastic on top so i'm not too concerned a that we haven't
gone into depth about that but it might be something you could consider when you're thinking about shapes
in fact we might like to put a slogan on and um possibly the two r s to signify the company rather than real reaction
sounds good and i'd say that that's us for now okay
just put it on the deskt desktop
project documents yeah
what's your username
what's your username and password
mm hmm
sorry
okay
there we go
'kay
sure
um sh would you like to i'll just do it from here
um try second one maybe
try it yeah maybe
yeah okay oh i thought i put in my last name i guess not but
okay
oh yeah that'd be fine that'd be great okay functional requirement by me ebenezer
okay so um we did some research we asked one hundred people their opinions on remote controls
we asked some uh open ended questions just what are your opinions on the remote control
got a lot of re responses and we asked some very specific questions and we got a lot of good feedback please
bear in mind this is only a hundred people so even when the groups are divided into fifteen
to twenty five twenty five to thirty five there's only maybe ten people fifteen people in each group
okay
so we got some the bad stuff we got remotes are often lost i often lose my remote
control the back of the couch some place and even if it's not lost permanently it takes me a few minutes
to find it most buttons are not used any more like you said teletext is outdated now
i remember trying to load a d v d  player recently and there were so many buttons it took me
i don't know maybe ten minutes to to go through each button 'cause you have to press the shift button to access the yellow
buttons you know there's just a lot of stuff that no one really uses and if they do not very often
takes too long to master the remote control i've seen some remote controls that are big they have a lot of buttons
you have to hold down more than one key at one time to do something they're just not great to use we just got a lot
of bad complaints about remote controls people do not like remote controls some of the good stuff we got
between the age of uh fifteen and twenty five most people would be willing to pay extra for voice
recognition software now don't get excited yet i've got more to say on that most people'd be willing
to pay for that um most people want remote controls to be pretty they want it to be fancy
th they they want it to be different everybody has a white remote control with black buttons and a red button
and a green button not everybody wants that finally my opinion
the voice recognition thing is cool and uh voice recognition the software open source software exist already
it's a bit sketchy at some times uh you're not gonna get good always accurate results but for a very fixed
number of words you know you have how many different words can you have for a remote control up down left right
channel five channel seven you know how many you can't have that many words for a fixed vocabulary it works quite well
i'm pretty sure people would buy it but after a while people may wanna return it because if you have to
to say som i mean most people use a remote control for switching to channels and they say they do that about ninety eight percent
of the time using the remote control ninety eight percent of the time for changing channels and that's for flickering through channels so if you
have to say up up up up if you have to do that all the time
then people might get a bit fed up with that and they may return it
however oh because the voice recognition software exists already there's no need to spend money on research and development but this does mean the need for microphones in the
in the remote control which is an unusual feature in my opinion but if we do have the voice recognition thing there's
a lot of stuff that you can uh get rid of see you could there're two options either you have voice recognition
by itself which i think is a bit impractical for like night time if you wanna be watching television and you wanna be quiet
or i don't know you have a visitor coming round and the remote's only trained for you it's a bit impractical to have just voice recognition
by itself so you can have voice recognition and a regular remote but imagine you got rid of the regular
remote part then you can design the remote to look any way you want it to look because there are no restrictions
on physical size or shape it it could be as fancy as you want it to be you know it
could be like a lollipop or something like that something weird like that as long as the voice recognition stuff works that's that's
fine
so we have the three birds we have the design that we have the the fancy bit right the voice
recognition's fancy it's cool it's different it's radical so and then we have an extra bit
i don't remember so i'm pretty sure people will buy the remote but is it practical to have a voice
recognition system in a remote control i think is a big question um will people
will people be willing to wait for the the period that it'll take to train the remote 'cause i think it will the
remote will uh get better over time with the same user user but for the first week or for the first two weeks
are you willing to wait are you willing to have a bad remote control and uh what if you
have visitors come round they stay the night they wanna use the t v  they can't use the remote because they speak differently
to you um how do you account for regional accents and stuff like that uh will
people return the remote control i think a lot of young people will buy the remote control if they have the money you know so do our
audience have the money but would they return it after a while because it's not as fast as pressing a button
it's not a practical so these are things i think we should consider i think it's cool
i'm sorry
sure i'm about to end yeah i think it's cool
but there are definitely some considerations
so yeah
there was uh a website uh
right here
g i started making stuff up then i got an email saying
mm
well like if you go to one uh whichever one you were working yeah and you just click file save as

mm hmm
'kay
mm
i uh
mm hmm
mm
sure but the idea of a remote with a menu or and a joystick
i think like i h if i was in the habit of buying remote controls then i would want one but i think
we don't have a specific audience you know like what is our target audience what niche are niche are we
trying to market and corner you know you know what i'm saying like for whom is this intended everybody
most people yeah
mm hmm
sure i think that's fair yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah mm hmm
yeah
hmm
okay specifically television
so the joystick is just for differentness
okay
mm
mm hmm
it's just the way i figure it twelve point five euros per unit
we have to sell at least like three million or something like that not to account for all the
the money we waste on remotes that no one buys you know like if we made a perf if we made a
ks for every remote we made someone bought it then we have to sell a lot of remote controls we just
is this gonna be enough to to sell
yeah
i had one of those and my brother and my dad could have beat me up because it it went off all the time accidentally
the clapping one
to a television
yeah
yeah that's a good idea
i think so yeah
but we have a frequency of how what people use a remote control for most um
power is used like once per hour channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight per hour
that's by far the biggest one and then teletext is still here that's like fourteen
and volume selection
no yeah okay okay
yeah um
mm hmm
um i think because it's so small it might be an uh i mean if we only have like two three buttons it might be essential to have to have that
yeah
speaker yeah
w those little key rings have both so
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
well i can give you the frequency what people what options people use most often i guess that's gonna be important in the ts defining the the software side of the interface right you want the stuff
okay
okay
mm hmm
sure sure
mm
sure
'kay yeah
transmitter
how did where did where did you get all your in information
oh
ah okay
yeah
uh i was still working on stuff i hadn't got it finished um alright
click to save in where do i have to save it

um what i've done with it i'm sorry
shit
um
i'm just closing it now where i've saved it
that's it there yeah
oh right
uh right i'm responsible for working design uh this is basically the inside going on of the
the uh remote control so we have the energy source we have the user interface this this is what i've seen
uh the sender will push the button the chip will respond uh and then
the dig digital signal is sent to the t v  so uh
uh if you go to next slide you'll see you'll see uh what do we need on the user
interface do we need uh many buttons or do we need l many light bulbs that could be easier to
uh to realise which appliances are on or not um or would that take too
much power would we need more um components in there to supply the power um
the joystick is another thing if we were gonna add that um there'd be more components to deal with that
um so uh we need to
i dunno exactly what
that's the design of the the the layout of the uh electronic design but um obviously there'll be more details once we've decided what we're putting on the user interface so that'll be decided i guess
uh and the next slide
oh yeah
um if you go to the next slide then i just used the it was a mess uh i was just putting adding it together at the end there uh
uh so you have the energy source obviously connected to the chip and the user interface obviously contains everything
you have the switch turn it on infrared bulb uh will contact the t v  and will have whatever device or d v d  player the bulb will turn on to say it's on
uh so do we need on the control uh different buttons to decide or different light bulbs would it be easier um i dunno what we should decide on that
no it's finished yeah
cost mm
l c d  on the remote just telling you what's on or uh interactive l c d  or
do you think that people will get mixed up like they'll be looking at this screen and that screen and then you know trying to get everything working would it be a bit confusing
yeah
yeah

we're just saying volume should volume be important in the joystick do you think
yep
i
yeah think so
light bulb as well no
and a light bulb no to flash no
nah you'd see it anyway if you hear it
yeah
mm hmm
so i should just look at um the speaker the speaker and an l e d  and
yeah and a transmitter
p
fashion
the slogan is yeah the slogan's we put the fashion in electronics isn't it
's also look cool
okay good morning everybody oh everybody is not ready
alright okay let's go so we're here today to to have our first kick off meeting about uh this new project we're going to tak to talk about in a few minutes
um so i will be uh sebastian the project manager um you are the
okay
okay very good thanks for being here um so let's have a look to the the agenda
so we are going to go through this agenda uh and mainly first to uh
to make to to be used to the tools uh available in this nice and smart meeting room we have here
um then we'll go to uh the plans for project and have general discussions about it
so the goal of this project is to uh developed a new
remote control um it should be original trendy
and also user friendly
as usual we will follow the the project method um that we are using
in the in our company it is in three step as you know first the functional design
the second's a conceptual design and then the detailed design
during each step uh of each design we wi you will work
uh s separately individually on uh your specific tasks and will m
we will meet to um to discuss and take decisions about uh what you've
you've you did and what uh we will do next
so first we have to to train ourself with all the um the tools
availables in the in this nice meeting room and uh particularly the the
white board so uh we are going to go through the white board and take some um
s some notes or do some drawings so who want to start
mister

you have one in mind
okay th thank you very interesting guillermo you want to

it would be very funny for us
oh
okay thank you hemant





poor elephant
yes we have to i have to catch you sorry we have to to go through the meeting thank you
yeah we'll discuss a f a fly or do we'll do another meeting abo on elephants
so so another important part of the project is about money
uh and about so about finances so we should target
selling price of twenty five euro for this remote control
and uh we have um which which would generate a profit of of um fifty million euros okay and we should target the inter an international market
o this is the next topic we have to discuss exactly so let's go to it
so um we should decide which kind of remote control we want to uh we want
to uh we want to go should be should should it be um specific remote control to some specific
device should it be a universal one and uh etcetera
so um so i'm waiting for your for your inputs very quickly because we have only three three minutes to go
okay
okay i think this is more a job to our market person yeah so it should be the topic of maybe of the next meeting just to to have an overview of this and uh in which direction we should go
so we need to close the meeting uh we'll have a new meeting soon and uh so the work every every of you ha have t d to do
so um you have to work on the on the working design you have to uh work on the technical functions and uh you have to work on us user requirements specs alright
um you will receive some information by emails i as usual thanks for coming today thanks
uh almost
ready
i'm uh michael i'm the user interface designer
ah well if no one else wants to yeah
okay so want me to draw my favourite animal let's see
well i don't really have a favourite animal but um uh i think i have one in mind so uh
i'm gonna about the uh spider because you can actually draw it pretty well in the corner of a white board
the spider has a spider lives in a web
and uh
it has eight legs
and uh it can move all about the web in two dimensions
unless it's a three dimensional web which y they have sometimes there are some spiders that live in like that have like uh kind of a a big ball of a of a web
and uh the other thing is some spiders can actually uh fly like uh they have uh they
let out like uh a stream of like the web building material but it's it acts like a parachute so they can actually kind of
go and find new uh build a new web somewhere else
so i think they did this in uh in charlotte's web that movie that little uh well it's actually a book first but uh
um at the end all the the spiders kinda flew away so that's my animal

maybe it's happy 'cause it just ate someone


so you don't like pink panthers
so is this uh an indian or an african elephant 'cause you haven't drawn the ears
okay
we can discuss that off line

so could i just ask one question um
is this a stand alone unit that we're gonna be selling so it's gonna be you already have a t v  but you're buying an extra remote control for it or something
okay alright
okay well so it seems the the first thing that they've kinda specified is the price like based on how much profit we wanna make which seems to
a kind of a little strange if we don't know what the the product is yet but i guess if that's if that's the requirement that we need to to design the the product to actually fit that
that price bracket so i guess we're gonna need to find out what's actually you know what people ar are willing to pay for um what kind of product they're expecting for twenty five euro because it seems quite a lot for a remote control so it's
yeah
okay alright
good morning
and i am hemant the industrial designer
but don't you think it's very difficult to draw a panther
so bad i don't like it


um sure
oh yeah thanks
this lapel is coming out once in a while it's not very strong
okay so not the favourite animal but i think i'll draw elephant i'll try to draw elephant it's a problem
okay thanks okay so elephant goes like this
and then it has
four feet i don't know whether there's any dist there should be any distance or not but
i think this is the easiest and then we have it's trunk
and
yep something like this an eye cute yeah so
and sometimes they have a hump it seems that uh elephants are pretty friendly
and they they have one very important way a different way of
walking so when they walk wherever they are going to put their first feet the second
feet will always be when they'll come to that position the second the third feet will be there that's
the way they walk
and that's very peculiar about them none of the other animals walk like this and they are very useful to human beings
at least few few hundred years ago when there was no means of transportations or something or when they had to carry huge um loads from one place to another elephants were very useful
and they are found in um usually the warm countries and um they are the biggest terrestrial animal that's what i know about them so that's what i wanted to tell about elephants
there are two kind of uh yeah they are very different indian and african elephants so indian elephant is having
one bump i think and the african have two and then there's a difference in the trunk of the animals
these elephants who are indian and
so at some for some elephants it's the trunk is having one
do we have some message there
wind up okay some other time thank you

thanks
marketing person
mm hmm
thanks
hi i'm guillermo i'm the marketing expert
'kay
i dunno why but when i was a child i i wanted to be a a panther not a pink panther or maybe yes
uh yeah yeah
okay it's a friendly panther
yeah maybe
um
actually honestly i i i dunno what's what's his it's be
behaviour i dunno if if it's the male who who hunts or it's the female uh
i i i have watched that lions di didn't hunt it's the the female lions who who hunt
so but
i like it because it's fast and it's black as well so it can
he it can hide itself very easily and it's it's
it looks like um powerful strong
uh i dunno
i i watch a a film about a black panther when i was a child and i was in that age when everything was shocking me a lot okay
i like it

yeah

hmm mm mm mm



is recorded okay okay so welcome everyone so we are here for the kickoff meeting of uh the process of designing a new remote control
so i will first start with a warm welcome opening
stuff then uh we will uh see what will be uh our product
and what will be the different step we will have to design it
and uh then we will uh discuss if we have few ideas and we will uh end uh by uh dispatching the different task you will be you will have to fulfil to complete this process
so

sorry
you have another meeting soon
so you have to be quick
okay so the the goal is to have a remote control so
to have an advantage over our competitors we have to be original we have to be trendy and
we have to also try to be user friendly
so uh the design step will be divided in three uh main points first it will be the functional design
third is the conceptual design and then is the desired design so the functional design is to identify the main user needs the technical function the remote control should fulfil
and then we will move to f conceptual design where we'll specify the different component involved
what kind of user interf interface we want and what are the different uh trend in user
interface and stuff like that
and then the desired devi design will consist in uh specifically implementing and detailing the choice we've uh made in the second point
so i will now ask you which is very important for the design of a new remote control for to uh each of us to to draw uh your favourite animal on the white board

do you have any idea of which animal you want to show us
okay that's good n n
you should


if you want to react uh about this wonderful drawing uh i'll let you uh comment
okay it's an abstract drawing
i think it's nice and original
okay
you want to draw something christine

of course your animal is recorded so it's not lost

is this uh



ah okay it's pretty
okay it's your cat
okay olivier do you want to
okay i go but next time you'll do something i'm sure
i'm a bit short on cable okay so what could i draw maybe i can draw like
a very simplified cow i don't know if it looks like a cow
like a what
i dunno it it looks more like a donkey in fact i would say okay so i hope that it helps you uh in the process of designing a remote control
okay
let's move on so
here the uh financial objective of our project that is to say to
to have a production cost lower than twelve point five euros and have
a selling price of twice that price t in order to target a profe profit of
uh fifty uh million euros
yeah if it's trendy original i d fulfil the user needs
we have to discuss that point on yeah you you can suggest points like this so what what so we have to decide for example if it can control one device or multiple
so what's what are your ideas about that maybe i can have the your opinion from the marketing side
okay so if it selled uh by its own i it it would rather be for multiple device
do you agree
yeah so maybe it should be for multiple devices
and uh do you have any ideas um of uh design ideas or any uh uh technical requirement we we should uh fulfil
few buttons okay and do you have it also to be to be lighted in order to be used in the dark might be a good idea
okay and do you have any um any uh idea of the trend the trend in domain what it shouldn't it should look like or things like that
with rou okay like for okay
okay
so fit in your hand yeah
and also it have i it may be it may be important for the remote control to be uh
to to resist to various shocks that can happen if it fall water proof
as well maybe it is original because you can uh use it in your uh
in your bath whereas the others can't
maybe water proof would be very original
havin having a water proof remote control so that the people can uh use it in their bath
that could be uh
yeah but it is still something uh you have to buy and that is um not maybe very
yeah mayb
b
but maybe we can bulk it with uh already this plastic thing and uh the waterproof uh stuff as well
yeah maybe we can sell uh all that together so so plastic protection
and uh and a waterproof box as well
that might be good uh track to follow
optional or selled with it
yeah
maybe we can have uh
but we don't design the t v  maybe we can have uh something you whistle and uh the remote control uh beep
yeah barks yeah so we can uh have a whistle uh remote control
i don't know whistle able
th
whistle tracking yeah whistle tracking remote control that's a good idea that's very original and that's can uh improve
yeah d d uh
yeah but s still we have to mm we have to have an advantage over our competitors i think this is a good advantage
yeah we have to ask
yeah we have to ask the quest of that's uh design to the uh industrial um designer
which is you okay so try to find that for next meeting
okay so next meeting is in thirty minutes or so uh don't pani
so so i will ask the industrial designer to find out more about this industrial design
so any working any working function we have discussed
so then i will ask the user interf interface designer to to think about
the point we discussed like the number of buttons the the fact that is lighted or not
things like that and what would be convenient for the user
and also um i will ask the market expert to uh try to find out what are the absolute requirements what is absolutely needed in a remote control uh for the user
so and then uh i will uh just ask you to think about that and uh look at your mail because you will receive uh some good advice soon
so
thank you i think that's all for this point
anyway you will receive some messages

be careful
you eat it
does it move uh
okay but i don't know if it uh is still correctly uh
we'll see


how do you wear this thing
not too many cables and stuff



original

uh just one thing uh you said twenty five minutes but i have something else to do uh so gotta have another meeting uh soon so maybe you could hurry up a bit
it's true i have another meeting so if you could uh
yeah
yeah for the lawnmower project
okay

what an original idea
orangutan

can i give you the no but i don't have to say anything
when i'm drawing the orangutan


it's an abstract drawing of an orangutan
yes
i don't have a red colour usually orangutans have red hair so this is a very important but i don't have red pen so
yes

yes i know


wha what is this strange beast
is it a monster
it's a cat
i thought these things did not exist
ah yeah
does have a name
caramel ah ha
next time i concentrate
he looks like a bong
okay sorry no
scary

i i think we will be finished this uh
is it for uh for putting a for logos no
that's
i is there a matter for a new remote control
is it uh a single device remote control or is it a multi device remote control
ah this is not defined at all
ah okay

well uh do we sell other stuff
uh if if we bundle the remote control with something uh to sell then it could be a single device otherwise it could be programmable one otherwise who would buy a remote control from us
yeah
no i couldn i cannot fi think of any requirements right now


mm
something like that least fits in your hand
yeah the basic requirement
only a buck

waterproof

mm
b it seems uh so but uh if you don't have an waterproof remote control it means you can just cover it with some plastic and you can sort of f
and and that's one of the that's one of the shock i mean there are people that have a remote control and they are worried that it's going to break and they put some extra plastic around it that's people they actually do it themselves
i it will look a bulky in that case
like as an optional thing
barks

that's that's quite cool but uh of course we you don't normally need uh any audio uh recording stuff on your remote control right
so i it's just going to add t to the cost
it's cool i think i like the idea but i'm not sure about the what you who is giving who's giving who's giving our budget who's
yeah yeah
'kay
mm hmm
mm
good

uh so we come back in five minutes
half an hour



no no n

you should write y the name i think



me ah yeah yeah

caramel and you i think i'm too short for the cables


quite squarey
he also
mm
mm hmm
i think we shouldn't have too many b for my part i think
if we don't have so many buttons could be nice
yeah

something which is not squarey maybe uh not a box
yeah
mm hmm
and i think we should have a device
sorry
yeah
directly
yeah
and i i think we should have something most of the time i i lose my remote control we should have s uh special bu button on the t v  to make the remote control beeping
ah yeah
yeah
barks
yeah
yeah whistle
whistle tracking
yeah yeah
okay
don't panic
mm hmm
mm hmm
ah



okay uh sorry you have to imagine a little bit um
this
sorry too uh


is it beautiful
do you know it's a cat isn't it
yes yes is it like that is it better okay it's my cat yeah the name is caramel
yeah








thank you
am i starting now
anytime oh sorry 'kay um alright welcome back fro
to the second meeting and um i hope you had a productive last thirty minutes um
and um i'll be taking minutes on this one and um being hooked up to the powerpoint for
this meeting isn't very necessary for uh myself because it'll be more about uh what you guys are bringing
to the meeting today um so the first presentation we'll be looking at
is poppy's presentation and um
so sorry so um take it away poppy
it's it's plugged in so um
no problem
i'm sure it's fine

right um one question this um self destructible uh metal it allows for recycling
materials so that um someone could have this product for as long as they felt
that they wanted it and then once they contribute it then that company can break down the part the parts better
yeah
mm hmm
would we be the company that would break down these or uh metals or would we contribute to another group
alright
okay this sounds like a really great idea one thing we have to consider is our uh one hundred percent um
turnover goal that we have for our financial sector um so we'll have to investigate
how much that will cost us cost the company um 'cause it sounds very labour intensive you would have to hire
a number of people and it might be more expensive
mm hmm
alright we'll still have to investigate the financial implications
alright i like the environmental approach um we'll have to see if that can meet our financial goals as well
i'm sorry could you those were um
okay
so those are what um we'll c construct the remote those are all the
alright great
alright thank you very much
and um the next presenter will be tara
yeah function f  eight sorry
yeah
right
does everyone agree with this does anyone object and and find the multifunctional might be a better way to go
mm hmm
yeah
alright sounds great
alright well um are you ready for your presentation genevieve
fabulous except you're not hooked up to the great
no problem we can
i'm sorry what was that last thing that you just said
mm hmm
i'm sorry that eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy you mean that they would spend more money on a fancy looking remote control
okay
alright so it might be very appealing if um we have very concise buttons and another thing with um lots of
surfing we'd probably have to work on something that could be um a lot more durable because i find
with um channel changers that um a lot of the numbers get rubbed down if they're printed on the button
yeah it's um no it's a button that you press and then you uh like a menu pops up i haven't used it before but
mm
that's rather sad
yep
i agree with um if we're targeting young adults then it would be something we should look into um financially and
and functionally um and especially if we are um trying to be trendy go with fashions
things like that um ages like from thirty five to sixty five which show lower numbers probably won't be
as concerned
mm hmm
yeah and something that might further complicate it is that the t v  makes noise itself wonder if it would have
yeah


yeah if we're looking for a simplistic design if we need to decide if that is our um intention is is a simplistic design um because if if it is then i think voice um voice activated
yeah and that would sort of negate the whole remote control thing because if people can activate the television with their voice then they won't be using a they won't be talking into a remote i'm sure
um i don't know what an l c d  screen is
i have no idea still i'm sorry
oh on the remote okay
yeah
right

mm hmm

yeah
and if one of the largest uh or most complained about thing is that it takes so long to get to know
how to use a remote control i'm sure that something like an l c d  screen or remote control would be
just furthering that problem
yeah
alright
okay before we go into uh more discussion on we want
this design to look like i've received some information from the management that will affect some of our decisions
um for one thing because having controls with d v d  v c r 
that sort of thing would really complicate the design of the remote control um
we've decided not to include them and make it a specific just a specific television um function
which is good as as we've sort of decided that we would like to go with that anyway um for many reasons
so um we have that decision sort of made for us another thing that might um
affect other decisions is that um the management feels that teletext is outdated because more people
are using the internet now and so uh we won't concern ourselves with um navigating the teletext
option yep
okay sure
yeah i do i'm looking at looking at it right now
thank you

um well i mean we don't have the resources or or possibility of using the internet with the remote control but um they were just pretty much saying that the teletext would not be used
alright and another thing this is for the design the design of the product is that um we wanna create um
more of a sense that people know that this is from our company so um all the remote controls
must have our um we'll incorporate our logo and colour in in some way so
um perhaps um our logo on the bottom or wherever you feel like it would look good
um it doesn't have to be the colour of our um of our company but another
thing is that um
we need to we probably would have to have that colour and and logo decided upon
um i'm assuming that we already have one but for the purposes of this meeting i i wasn't offered
a like a type of logo or colour so if that could be um somewhere on the design so that we can be recognisable
the little r  r  yellow thing okay real reaction
okay um yes those are the changes um so now we need to discuss um
and come to a decision on our remote control functions of of how this is going to be i'm just going to look at my notes for
a second um we have to decide on a target group and the functions of the remote control so
um we already know that it'll just be for the television it'll it won't have teletext but um
you know we could discuss um those other options that you brought up genevieve
is that how most people feel about that okay
yeah but another thing is that if we're reaching an international crowd um i know for one that in north america there is no such thing as teletext so it'd be really superfluous
yeah i don't know about other countries besides the u k  do you know if anywhere else has it
alright
it was a management decision so it's it's pretty much out of our hands at this point
'kay
so i guess we're looking at something rather simple
yeah i think we should definitely go ahead with the alarm system idea that you had 'cause i'm sure that could be inex inexpensive because we could use the same kind of infrared
the same signal through that and it could just like make a little beeping noise it's not that expensive to do
yeah
yeah okay i like that idea
yeah the button oh
minor detail there
yeah it would have t
mm hmm
yeah then it wouldn't it probably wouldn't be able to use it would be able to use the same reception on the remote c control i guess but the actual device would have to have its own infrared signaller okay
maybe um
probably i mean that's your department you'll have to sort that out
yeah you'll have to yeah you'll have to investi do some research on that alright great um alright and i'm sure that um
um the glow in the dark fluorescent whatever system um is a go ahead is everyone interested in that
yeah
yeah
hmm
yeah but i mean
yeah
yeah
could we somehow we could may possibly sorry incorporate them both so that
the buttons could maybe be in the shape of the numbers themselves and be made out of some glow in the dark material
'cause i d i don't think that glow in the dark material um like the actual soft plastic
um costs that much more than other colours
yeah
alright we have five minutes left
um for the meeting but i think we should discuss this light subject a little bit more before we close um what was i missed the last moment reading that what were you talking about with the lighting up buttons
yeah
yeah
mm so it could be any button that would be pressed
yeah
okay so that's probably feasible so do you think that we should do the lighting up thing and the glow in the dark thing and the shape of the numbers do we have to kind of decide what we're gonna do with this
yeah okay
yeah
yeah yeah and it could if it's that softer rubber material it'll be maybe um uh
better for people with um els no what's it called r s i  what was it that we were talking about yeah
yeah instead of like hard buttons okay um did we want to go for the glow in the dark
look or did we want to go for the lighting up instantly like should we do both or we can have one
or the other because it might for for our design purposes i mean the lighting up thing might be
better because glow in the dark material has a funny kinda colour and it might not go with different like
face plates that we might come up with
yeah
right right
alright so we've decided on lighting up things
yeah
yeah but with the same thing i mean if you touch the button and then it could be it could be lit up as well is are you okay with that okay cool um
alright so i think that um
that completes most of our um our more uh practical decisions and now it's up to designing and um making sure that this can be feasible and do you have anything do you have anything to say
like an ipod or something okay
like a cellphone yeah
mm hmm accessories
yeah i think that we should incorporate that
'cause that wouldn't be very expensive at all you'd just get one mould
throw some plastic in it you know
yeah well that might be com problematic with um copyright issues so if it takes off then we'll we'll we'll try that out
right we'll have to do more research like as of yet that has nothing to do with um the way it'll look um does it need to be reached a de do we need to reach a decision on that right now because we need to investigate the financial implications
okay
is it does it need to be uh decided on now or should we
okay
good alright then anyone else have anything more to say before we close
alright well
let's have lunch and we'll discuss this later alright
okay
yeah that's okay that's okay
okay
okay um do i need to plugged in
f  okay function f  eight sorry about this guys
'kay is on
right
okay i will take this time just to apologise i i only uh received
my emails later on 'cause i was too busy carried away doing my own thing which is not obviously not a very good part
of a team working thing but there we go um so i was looking at how
we're going to go about the working design and what we actually need to do and what the remote
control needs to do and it needs to um allow a person to have a portable desi device
so they can control the television from wherever they are they don't need to actually manually touch the television
set so it gives them much more flexibility and allows them to be where they want to be
um from
uh on a functional side of things we found out that wh from our previous meeting we decided
that there're certain points that will make our product unique um one is the visibility
in the dark which was um genevieve's idea so we need to think about
how we could bring this in um technically and we could use illuminated buttons which we are all familiar with when we're
using a mobile phone or um something fam familiar a automatically um lights up at
first touch or we could use fluorescent materials which would just um take in the light during the day
and then as soon as they go off they would glow in the dark
um also we could use um an alarm so if we lost the
um remote control perhaps there could be a button on the television set itself which you could press
and then an alarm from the handset would sound where it was hopefully in the room maybe behind a cushion or somewhere
um so that would work um oop go back there
um another thing i think we d missed out on on the last meeting was the fact that we should consider the environmental impact
of our design um from previous researches i've carried out on other projects
um we've learnt about smart materials where um um specific alloys of
metals have a shape memory so they can be heated and um
and cooled and they change the shape of um the metal so for example a screw that's holding
something together could expand and it would force all the components apart
so um the benefits of this for our product would be that when it came to the end of its product life if it
was heated um everything would spring apart so all the um individual components
could be easily separated and then some could be reused some could be recycled and i think that would be very important for
products now especially 'cause there's much uh responsibility for all the um companies who are coming up with
like new designs 'cause all we all know that our resources are being limited and we have to be very environmentally conscious
yeah
um
and then
yeah
yeah they would um you would make the the product as you normally
would apart from the the bits that hold it all together would be made out of this shape memory alloy and that's
the part that would um allow all the other parts to be separated
at the end i mean the user would return the p product to the company 'cause it's the product's responsibility
to get rid of what they've made um and then the company could then just use make use
of this shape memory alloys to split up the components and
then either reuse some bits and other bits which are obviously gonna wear out with time or not usable they might be
like be able to put into scrap metal something like the case if it's scratched or something you would want to reuse it but
you might be able to melt it down and reuse it again somewhere else
you could we could probably empl em employ a a side company or something to do that
for us but it would be our responsibility to get that done and to dispose of the products that we
made for a certain percentage at least not every not a hundred percent of everything we produce but
yeah yeah
yeah
well i the fact of the shape memory alloys is that they they don't need to be manually de um
deconstructed like you don't have to individually um unscrew all the screws because of
this their properties are smart material all you need is just the heat so they self destruct themselves
so i suppose it does need like high contact yeah you know high uh quality machinery and very
specific machinery but
yeah
okay
um also
there is um components this'll be how it uh will actually work but i haven't put this plan together yet
there we go sorry should i go back
this would actually show the circuit diagram although i haven't come up with the final circuit yet so i just put all those components in
yeah i it just shows what sort of energy source it could be a battery like rechargeable probably um an'
yeah well how the infrared will actually be sent through the chip to be received
by the chip on the television set itself okay
so now is it f  eight again to escape or escape
there we go
okay
thank you
there you go tara
function f  eight the one at the top
um i was just wondering about the what what genevieve said before about having like some hidden
controls like having the outer casing and that would probably um i d
well well what you said before about it being a more profitable simplistic design i suppose having that would complicate it a lot
more and limit the design do you think
yeah
yeah that's true yeah
yeah
okay yeah
mm
yeah

mm yeah
mm hmm
mm
the single function yeah
yeah that's a good point

it's like the news or like information
the and what's on
it's like
it's like very basic internet sort of um
yeah it's just information that um like television timetables what's on what's on now what's on next on every channel and
yeah
to get the right reception and picture i suppose

repetitive strain injury
i think


oh i'm guessing that's what it is i'm not
mm
yeah
yeah it is
mm hmm
mm
yeah
and if there was conversation in the room at the same time although in theory it
doesn't tend to be when you're watching television but could be very difficult to
get the specific uh design yeah
mm
yeah
mm
what what would appear on the screen
like linked in with the teletext or sort of like an
teletext at your fingers without having to access that through the television
mm yeah
could be
mm hmm
yeah
mm
yeah
yeah complicated jus complicating things even fo mm okay
can i just interrupt
would you like to plug in your have you got a powerpoint or not okay thanks
were they was the management suggesting use of the internet rather than teletext or just avoiding both altogether
yeah yeah
okay
yeah okay
right
yeah yeah
okay
just

okay work on that
yeah
mm hmm
okay

yeah
yeah
yeah
i don't know more research required i think but if was it a management decision that we're having okay so
okay
'kay
minimal

yeah okay
yeah the same signalling i mean
or vibrate just the same as a mobile phone like you just a a buzz or something yeah
if do you mean the the link between the well if the button was actually on
oh yeah
maybe yeah yeah maybe something adhesive that you could like stick onto the back of any set that would be um yeah not very obtrusive obviously something small that's yeah that's a good point
yeah
yeah okay
pr probably unless it could be okay
um unless some way it could have some universal connection
to like the socket the same socket that the t v 's supplied from i mean the power for the t v  so
mm more research into that one yeah
y
yeah
yeah yeah
yeah
like a raised
yeah
that's true and also y uh heather you mentioned before um like how it should be accessible to
everybody um so like big b um buttons for people you are visually impaired
the glow in the dark or light up won't make any difference anyway so like you say tactile might be better because it'd be more
available to everybody
yeah yeah
mm hmm yeah
no it's not these days i mean it's quite easily accessible
yeah yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah yeah
so self timed lighting
um i
yeah
so self timed
yeah
yeah
i think the shape of the numbers is a really good idea and i think that's un unique as well i mean i haven't seen that and as you're saying like numbers can wear off if they're just sort of like painted on you know printed
durable
oh yeah yeah yeah repetitive strain injury mm hmm
yeah
yeah and we could yeah there are now like loads or a huge range of different colours that it could light up in as well which could
like link in with the company colours like it could be blue or green or yellow or like we've just limited t with the
just ordinary phosphorescent so
yeah every time the that it lit up you c that could light up as well or or the whate
yeah
is
okay like you can have changeable um mobile covers or something yeah or okay
yeah
person
yeah well that's great
interchangeable um als
yeah interchan
and also possible i mean uh we could gain out of that by advertising certain t v  shows or
yeah but if we there is yeah we could um the environmental factor we didn't bring that up again
yeah
um i've
okay let's
i think we could probably leave that 'til later on then
no
okay thank you


f  eight w function f  eight






thanks
can you see
do you think
is it uh function eight yeah
oh right okay
okay
i'm the user um
user interface designer uh the technical functions design of the apparatus is
the effect the apparatus should have um in this case it's the function of the remote control
which is to send messages to the television television set by taking inspiration
from other similar designs we'll try and come up with an original trendy remote control which is sellable international
there're two functional design options a multifunctional remote control which can be used for several
entertainment devices and a single function remote control used specifically for the television
sorry um a single function just for the television itself
yeah
um multifunctional controls can be difficult to use as the multitude of buttons can be confusing
a single function remote control is simpler to use but it means you have to have other remote controls for your other entertainment devices
um i think that a single function remote control would be preferable because
it's easier to use it'd be more compatible with a range of television sets making it more
internationally sellable
um it will make an original design more obtainable as we have less functional necessities
to include in the design and it would be more profitable as it would be more simplistic and
less functions would have to be included
so it would be cheaper to make and probably more sellable just because it's more compatible with a r a wider range of devices
does anyone have any questions
well it's just that when we're creating it we're we have to make it um compatible
with different brands of devices and it would be easier
to make it compatible with just different brands of television devices rather than other ent yeah
other entertainment devices
yeah
yeah
yeah yeah
and with this we'll have more room in the budget probably to make a more original design we'll have more money to go into the design side of it

yeah yeah
it's um
it has t v  has like information it has information on holidays the news entertainment no li yeah
yeah
and you have page numbers like for the menu and you press the page numbers with your remote and it it'll come up
very basic internet yeah but you have yeah but you have no interaction back with it you know like the internet you can send emails and you've no interaction
yeah
yeah
uh probably just tuning in the channels would it be tuning them in at the very start you know if you get a new t v  set you tune in all the channels do you th do you think yeah yeah
repeti uh
yeah yeah i think it is
yeah
mobile phone yeah
yeah
could it it it would be good if it had the actual programme that was on and what was next but that would probably be
yeah that would be good yeah
yeah
might be quite expensive to do that though


and we should keep in mind that fifteen to twenty five year olds might not have twenty five euros to spend on a remote control like their priorities might not be a fancy remote control when they're just starting out and yeah
yeah yeah
early twenties that's the kind of age group twenties
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
i think it would be annoying though if i don't use teletext that much but if it was on your t v  you'd want to be able to use it if
you'd yeah
so is it just okay alright right
i don't know
i don't know

yeah
okay then

yeah
would you be able to um put the little device anywhere 'cause uh isn't our remote control for
all t v s so
you'd ha
yeah with the button that you pressed yeah
c 'cause then it would only be a applicable to one t v  set so it would need to be something that you could stick somewhere or something
yeah
yeah
yeah
would it need a battery then

yeah

i i like the light up suggestion i think that would be better 'cause you know the way fluorescent lights lose their brightness after certain time so
i would go for
well just the numbers could be embossed couldn't it like raised
yeah could be raised
just little arrows that you could feel maybe
yeah
yeah
that i think that's good yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
no i wouldn't say so
that's good yeah that a good idea
yeah
yeah
that yeah that's a good idea
yeah
yeah for visually impaired yeah
yeah
if

i was thinking though if it was glow in the dark you could put the um real reaction symbol as glow in the dark and then it would be constantly advertised
yeah yeah
yeah okay
yeah
oh yeah interchangeable thing
that would be good yeah
yeah and then that would be uh more profitable like as a sideline to the remote as well y could buy extra
yeah
that's a good idea yeah
no
oh yeah
if w
no
okay



oh
function f  eight
that looks right
i'm sorry what was that last one multifunctional and
ch oh i see
'kay
so as far as we know um a single function television remote control is us usable internationally

right
d v d s and v c r  okay
yeah i think i agree with the single design thing for now because we're trying to do so much that if we're trying to make a unique user friendly dadada and it's also multi also multifunctional um we're gonna go over budget for one thing so
mm hmm
mm 'kay

yes i am
oh i'm not hooked up but other than that completely ready
okay
okay
oh i just lost my microphone
just a moment okay so i'll be discussing the functional requirements of this remote control
um and i'll give you a little briefing on what that means exactly um
if you all remember from the email we got before our very first uh kick off meeting with the coffee machine the functional requirements
of that was to produce hot coffee quickly um so what i'll be talking about now is the equivalent for a remote control
um so basically what needs and desires are to be fulfilled um i've done some marketing research a lot of
interviews with remote control users um and some internet research and i'll show you my findings
oh and firstly i wanted to remind you about our company motto and purpose so we believe in providing international market with fashionable products
um hence our motto we put the fashion in electronics so i think that should be our priority here um
and we should also be looking to trends in clothing and interior design not just in electronic fashion so that it's something that fits in the household
um we should be looking towards trends in both clothing and interior design any trends that are going on in in the public even media you know who's famous what t v  shows are being watched um to influence our remote control
okay so the findings um seventy five percent of users of remote controls find them ugly which is a quite
a significant number um the other twenty five percent didn't specify if they love them or found them you know neutral
eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour
of the user
yeah they're willing they're willing to spend money on a remote control with personality as opposed to your basic you know oval black
all same size button remote control um so it is something that people care about it's not it's not ignored in the household
um seventy five percent of remote control users said that they zap a lot zapping meaning they go through channels a lot they're you know thumb masters
um and fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons that a very small
amount thought that was interesting
yes
and actually to go with that i'm gonna give you some statistics on the uh relevancy of the buttons how much they're used
and uh how important the uh users find them so the power button obviously in an hour is only used once hopefully the person's
not turning on and off the t v  um but the relevance of that button is nine out of ten so people wanna be able to turn on the t v 
with the remote control um as opposed to standing up and turning on the television set
channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times on average per hour that's a huge amount this is the most important button
um so obviously when commercials come on they're changing it so as you said we want a durable button that's not gonna run down relevance of that button
our users found was uh ten ten out of ten uh ditto for volume selection so ten out of ten and it's used
on average four times an hour not as much as channel selection but still significant
um audio settings is used on average zero point eight times an hour relevance is two screen settings which means
brightness colour etcetera zero point five times an hour um and relevance of one point five we're getting to specific statistics
here teletext um now i'm not too clear on what that is i don't know if you can help me flipping pages
is that
so like a running banner underneath
oh
okay
okay like tells you the weather and okay
right
alright well i guess i'm not with it because i wasn't but it's it's being used fourteen times an hour um and has a r a high relevance of six point
five so it looks like something that we're gonna want to do some research on and include on our remote control um channel settings
zero point zero one times an hour relevance of three channel settings
p sorry changing the channels
oh okay
yeah okay
um so it's not used very often but people still find it relevant okay
um biggest frustrations of uh the people that we interviewed remote controls are often lost somewhere so that was already
discussed by poppy how we could have a an alarm system so that people can find it um takes too much time to
learn how to use a new remote control so it should be very user friendly you know people know what to do very quickly um
remote controls are bad for r s i 
ah is that what it is people with arthritis and such
um maybe our
designers can look into that um buttons that don't require you know very firm pushing if they respond but we'll have to also avoid you know buttons responding to the slightest touch as well that's a problem
okay did you guys uh get that one down
um okay here's some ideas for you a large percentage of the public would pay for voice recognition on the remote controls so i'll show you some numbers here
um so the youngest age group fifteen to twenty five ninety one point two percent said that they would pay extra money to have voice recogni voice recognition included on their remote control um and you can see that number decreases a bit with ol s interestingly enough twenty five to thirty five is the lowest amount
um that would are willing to pay extra so i guess we're gonna have to figure out what age group we're we're targeting and if and if voice recognition
is something we wanna look into and if we have the budget for it um if we are targeting young adults it looks like
something that would pay off seeing as ninety percent over ninety percent would pay for it
mm hmm
so that that's a whole other field of research i don't know if it'd be if we'd still have a remote or if you're talking to your television and saying change channel um and depending on how many members you have in households so it m it may be too complicated for us but it's something to keep in mind anyway

right
mm hmm
mm hmm
it looks like
mm hmm
it'd be like the ultimate remote
um okay and th the last thing here was a an l c d  screen so i mean voice recognition might
be a little too extreme for us not practical um an l c d  screen though might be something that you know you can shift through pages kind
of li the way this powerpoint is working so that you don't have so many buttons to deal with
oh sorry just just a screen like a computer screen s or like um
yeah or like an alarm clock you'd have an l c d  versus just a a normal clock
oh just like an electronic screen as opposed to just buttons there would be like a little like on yeah like on
the top of a cellphone the the little l c d  screen um now that's i i dunno exactly what exactly we'd put on
there i guess the channel that you're on the v the volume setting
mm hmm
well i guess that's something we can all take back to our respective research um and finally
whoops my personal preferences and thoughts um i think our priority really should be unique design um
we want something that people want in their home every remote control looks the same so uh in my opinion it should be um
user friendly and unique
so the other stuff might be a little too a little too gadgety for some people um i th myself
voice recognition kind of scares me off so if we're if we're aiming to make this an international university universally accepted
product um and for all the other thing is like age market i mean if we wanted to concentrate on fifteen to twenty five years olds we could go for the fancy
stuff but if we wanna make fifty million and and have everyone want this remote control we should maybe
stick to the basics
mm hmm
right and we have to keep in mind the the reliability of our research i mean you know a sixteen year old boy would say yeah i'd pay extra for voice recognition until they realise that's three months allowance um so i i think i think the older generations we should be catering to a bit more

yeah
yep
okay that's it for the market research
yeah maybe we can do the
there you go
oh come back screen
hmm

it's probably r  r r  in yellow
yeah i think
okay so i are we going to write off the l c d  option yeah
okay so no l c d  no teletext and no voice recognition
yeah never heard of it
um well i guess just from my findings it looks like we wanna minimise buttons
um
and the what was the word they used f findability is important
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm
mm
on the buttons
it doesn't it could it could be a tactile thing as well um right if w if we're minimising buttons we might be able to make them actually larger
and there's something on it s you know like up arrow down arrow for for volume um and i don't know what
we could do for for channels s
the numbers themselves but then the like up button and down button for the channel channel changing
yeah
i just thought that it it might be sucking more battery power if there if it is a light up i'm not sure
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm

i guess the other option referring to the battery thing is you know how cellphones will t light up for fifteen seconds or something when you're s
and then it goes so if if you're like changing the volume during a movie i know i'm thinking of mostly when you're watching a movie you turn all the lights off right and
you don't want to turn on the lights to turn it down because there's suddenly an explosion and it's gonna wake up the baby um so if you touch
the button it kind of reactivates it it lights up for
on self timer
yeah
oh just if it was kinda the same way that a cell you know how a cellphone will light up for about ten fifteen seconds when you touch a button after having not touched it for a while um if instead of a constant light up on the on the remote control if it lights up for ten seconds when it's touched again
yeah and you you touch it and it just kind of lights up a bit and it gives a faint glow so if you have all the lights off in your living room you'll you'll temporarily see it because usually you're not fooling around for it for more than what ten seconds so
mm hmm
mm hmm
oh right the
mm hmm
i was gonna say
exactly it the it might be perceived as tacky glow in the dark it's kind of like eighties neon style um whereas we're trying to be trendy and fashionable so
mm hmm
mm
that's true
what um oh sorry
yeah well i was just gonna throw out there the thought about um personalising the remote control um it you 'cause you mentioned face plates so i i dunno if there's something that
diff you know like five different face plates i dunno if this will start making it more complicated but it could increase the popularity of the of the remote um
yeah
exactly like an ipod exactly or or like mobile ph and i dunno if we'd want to go with like t v  show themes or something like a bart simpson faceplate but
mm hmm exactly you could start out with three and if if we hit it big then we can add some on
mm hmm
right
right


so we are here to just make the point well make the point yeah
make the status about the shot detection
to so you have applied the shot detector to some of the cinetis video or at least one
and uh so we can basically maybe just comment on on this maybe quickly remind
what the shot detector is how the shot detector is working basically uh
we might be able anyway to give you some reference i mean your report
it's it should be described there or yeah yeah you have the report okay
to olivier yeah
ah okay yes the kayak wi i was not even with the other one okay
by the way i was uh going to ask so i had seen the video i you uh did um a downsampling of the video right i mean
for uh browsing i mean okay yeah

so this is hierarchical normally so you have scenes and shots but
because for instance we could probably you know like group all the initial ones into one scene and maybe after when there's some things inside it s should be another scene so
which are extracted i think uh
downsampling
yeah
yeah the quality is that's why i was asking that it it's not this that you processed right okay okay
so here we see that we the shot at eighteenth and after twenty twos and after again and uh if we go down i mean maybe in terms of shot here we can see that
right i mean so now we see shot seven i suppose yeah
uh yeah okay shot nine currently shot ten probably
eleven or twelve no eleven or no this is ten indeed okay yeah
yeah this one it's eleven twelve
or fourteen seconds
yeah okay okay yeah it's inside and yeah it's really a dissolve or is it really like is you have the feeling that it's both
okay
but it's it's it's not standard man made movies because i would say most of
the time people couldn didn't do any dissolve
yeah i could see here i mean that it was like horse it was only one single one
n yeah yeah this is the one i i had seen yeah but as i said i mean uh with even the motion detector when it's black it's there is not s no structure so you don't esti yeah but you don't really estimate motion
well there is no structure there is no texture if you want to say so and this is this is not so good for the motion
uh but for instance of course between the horse and uh and um the
c the c uh uh yeah uh the cows
yeah maybe we could have detected things but it's not even sure because
the background is quite similar and uh it's it's it's not that sure
so it's yeah the histogram so we have experience with it so it's it's scrambled so
you can scramble the image and you get the same histogram so there is no structure
indeed so of course when you look the horse and then you can see as a cow the cows of course you have a
black in the top and uh you have also uh maybe eighty percent of like green uh
which is even not green there but uh uh grass you have stones and uh so
there of course are differences because on the one hand you have horse but it's black so you have more sky which is black on the right
so you don't care about this so it's a glo it's global it's a global histogram so
yeah
but it's when for this i would for this application i could imagine that it would were quite high uh and it's a threshold but still it's adaptive right if i remember well yeah
so because of course if you just compute the yeah if you have the report
because if you compute the um distance between the two histograms i think this was bhattacharya right
so now we know
and uh so if you take uh these two with the with the bhattacharya
uh then of course you should just do a threshold when there is motion you will see a lot of things changing
so by using an l r t t  threshold if you see that there is a continuous change of the d distance
you don't do a threshold it's only if you have an identified peak which is m fifty percent or maybe
uh two times higher than the the next second value in the
window then you say it's it's a shot right i don't know
yeah yeah
yeah
it's continuous for dissolve yeah but an anyway it's difficult
i mean in th in in in general because sometimes you have some dissolve you could imagine they are
part of of of a scene and uh so but of course when you have cuts you can see they are easy to
detect right i mean like something yeah
so uh yeah so with the motion basically the motion tried to estimate well the motion between
two frames right if my image is there but after it's there and it looks at how many points c are well
matched so you can see that like somebody speaking and so and so before the sh before the shot you can see that
usually there are like ninety percent of the points at least right who have some motion so uh
but then after suddenly if you go from one frame and you try to match all the points here with like a translation plus the zoom
plus maybe some rotation you c you can find anything well right so basically you would see that the number of points
maybe only ten percent of the points you can match well so it's easy to detect
and uh after you can see that indeed because it's a long shot and it's almost like a flat plane
you can do a very good registration through the number of points is very high i mean the number of points that are
matching uh and here you basically here with a histogram uh you can see it very
flat but of course you should go from this histogram to this which is essentially green you have this big uh
measure which is here uh the chi two i don't know whether this is what you implement is used in the
no it's
it's bhattacharya okay
yeah so yeah and you have maybe a one image with a um adaptive threshold i think you had something like this right just to explain uh how
yeah uh
yeah you see like here yeah
alpha times the maximum of the other ones of the other ones
so the of course if it's you are not a maximum you are not going i inside the window you are not the max
anyway you are not going to be to be above uh alpha times the max of the others right uh
because alpha is low lower than one uh
like for instance yeah like for instance here i i see six but i don't know whether this was for bhattacharya or for uh chi s chi two
yeah
yeah yeah yeah two point four yeah so it's a bit less because the amplitude is much smaller yeah
uh yeah so you can uh it was not so just i mean because the motion i mean it was uh
in the shot we've seen f because f especially with chi two square it r the amplitude it's much bigger than
with bhattacharya right uh you can see that it could go to seven hundred and when it's there is nothing it's can
be zero with bhattacharya it's between zero and one so you have not so much amplitude um
but uh still uh in some of the v these videos for instance even if we gon go now if we want to but now for the kayak
case i don't know uh at some point targeting two kayaks and it's moving quite fast towards
to other people i don't know what happened there if it was detected as a shot transition or
yeah yeah
it was it as a shot okay i was uh wondering yeah yeah maybe
but here for instance you understand so we can show this tomorrow to uh to the people at the ci cinetis meeting i mean to
right
yeah okay yeah we need a connection that's true
yeah that's true yeah i can bring my laptop if necessary yeah yeah i'll i'll bring it okay so it's it's done
well yeah but normally there is a a burning if you c maybe you can play the shot or
it's strange i mean maybe you play yeah if you play the the video well insi at the beginning i don't know what's happening
ah you didn't generate the okay the real media okay
well no i mean here i can see that it was it was detected as a single shot okay i was because here you can see that the motion uh here is uh you know he is uh doing a zoom on the two kayaks here
yeah and then he's doing quite a fast transition from these to another one and i was wondering whether
so if you well though of course it's true that it's mainly water so maybe the colour is indeed uh quite
but you know as a kayak is entering quite fast i mean you can have quite maybe good
distance but i see that it seems to be how many shots do you have indeed
de de detected
six yeah the one is uh maybe so you did it with with what by the way it's with the images i gave you or okay
ah to regenerate an a v i  file okay yeah yeah
okay
okay yeah
yeah

yeah i mean initially i don't know why there is a a shot detected
ah okay so the okay so the here is an image number in your programme ah okay okay yeah okay okay so then this
so but it's in seconds or it's
okay okay yeah okay okay seconds plus number okay so basically what has been uh yeah extracted is yeah this point rather than okay so this is normal okay
okay
okay like transition something that is okay
yeah it's motion yeah it's not a cut yeah but i was thinking that maybe it could have been but it's true that it's mainly water when
we see things so it's yeah it's not such a big uh but yeah sometimes i mean you can have various things
hap i mean just think about more action movie and thing like this
well sometimes it's very difficult so focus usually there is no problem people say this is a cut this is not a cut but like
for dissolve even sometimes you know people may it's people may have some trouble i mean
this is a dissolve this is not this should this should be labelled as a transition or not some people will say yeah but it's part
of the thing or uh for instance in like in um also in uh come on uh
advertising usually because the shots are very short in advertising usually it's uh very fast
and so sometimes yeah when you have an incrustation like last time what what should you say it's
it's yeah it's a change of
but uh
yeah i mean it's a so sometimes very difficult a at least what i can see that currently like for cinetis
uh for instance if it's to do colour correction or for instance if it's too black too a bit
whiter i think this type of things should be fine
because basically it's even if they are not real shots they are not so interested if it's not real shot maybe after they have
this and they may say okay just by looking at least the summary so maybe for the summary we could do better
uh key frame extraction for instance but by just looking at the key frames and so on they may say okay from this shot to
this shot we apply like uh specific um colour
enhancement algorithm or restoration algorithm or uh to improve uh the brightness and something
like this right and uh so i think for them this is fine um after
i yeah
well maybe after i mean they would sh okay uh they would go directly and say select the shots from here to here and they would say you apply this algorithm yeah
so of course we could try to make scene clustering and so on but i'm not even sure that this is necessary for them at
this point because uh if they have a six minute movie if they have thirty shots for them it might be easier to
look at from here to here i apply this and they can do it quite quickly and they have to do it an to do
it anyway because what's going to take time might be uh to select the type of restoration algorithm or the type
of things so this might take more time than having to click two times on two shots rather tha
tha than uh having directly a scene right so so i think for them uh this type
of things is going to be useful uh at least for this task
if they want to do stabilisation it may not be sure of that uh this is the right segmentation
for some of these but so but this is another point which
for motion stabilisation as i said several time we are not we did not commit to provide anything
but of course if we can provide things we'll do it but uh yeah so do you have
uh more question or uh do you have a
well i just i i i it's i think this is
yeah but after i mean it may be more like a guy um i
int i in an interface a guy interface i mean where i mean if second select from shot one to seven
uh this is a same seg they may do the grouping by themselves quite by looking at this it may take w
w less one one minutes and i think it's anyway if it's too summarised after they
may want to go inside uh to see whether there is not special things i mean so
uh because after it depends i mean if you give only one key frame per shot after i mean
it's one hundred seventy images it's quite fast right and so i think and the hierarchical thing is good because still you can
check if you have some ambiguities you are not sure you could
yeah yeah yeah at least yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah
well ultim ultimately i think this is the type of things but at this point we uh
yeah i i hope uh that uh if it's a big success uh
they will ask idiap to to provide something like this of course with some money or at least to pay a student or
somebody for doing it but uh yeah of course this was ultimately i think one way of uh
if you could provide like chapters or something like this indeed you could provide like the a v i  to the clients and he may
ask for special services or uh and even to just to watch the movie to have direct
access to different parts and so on but it's uh i mean uh this labelling might be more easy to do for the client
by the client because he knows what they're i mean he we wants to have this and this and uh right so
yeah yeah he may want to organi yeah yeah otherwise i mean this but of but of course it might
be easy to do a very simple software which would allow the user to select just
the shots and give names and after it would generate automatically some index and uh
as a i suppose the client might be interested in such a such a things if he could uh generate automatically on the d v d 
but for and you could imagine that before sending in the d v d  you could allow him to l to watch this
type of interface and he would be able to do the selection say this is this this is this this is this this is this
and when he would receive the d v d  he would indeed uh get already the chapters that he decided to
put there
yeah yeah yeah and i think this may it it's good that this is a demo like this because i'm sure that they might be interested indeed because i imagine that some people
yeah yeah yeah yeah
uh yeah so i think this is uh this is a very good uh and a yeah
but uh
so this is a kind of service i don't know either they give it for free and uh
but uh
but you see that sometimes even here it's a bit like uh it's for instance if people would like to have like some motion
compensation uh you i it could be proposed but
for instance here it i wou it would be problematic to have motion so i here it's fine to do motion compensation
but stabilisation rather than yeah
but
for instance here it's it's it's it's

effects okay
ah okay so maybe like here for instance it is a just reproduced two times uh
yeah
so this is vi okay this video is about four minutes five minutes right
ah okay so this is not the one that has been uh
okay
okay
it's it's it's real time right i mean the processing yeah
a bit more than real time well anyway yeah
yeah normally it could it could go faster but i probably it's probable that even for the project
you would do some of the reprogramming i mean to especially if uh
we need to interface new uh um yeah or for just reading
i mean the the d v x  and thing like this so it's uh uh so tomor anyway
for this we don't know exactly yet because it's not sure what they want to what the user's tools for reading d v d 
and so on so and s because i don't think this is so difficult now
you have um already looked at the histograms and open c v 
computing distances and so on so if we want to do a special thing that probably runs fast
it may be easier to do it directly and uh yeah
but uh but yeah the interface is very so the interface uses the output of your programme essentially okay
okay
mm
you can do the get frame
but otherwise it's not necessary oh yeah no no no ye okay oh no no you need you need to generate these images right okay
okay okay yeah
yeah
as a directory yeah yeah
yeah
yeah yeah yeah
x m l  yeah
on the shot
and it's a simple format i suppose like uh like you have scenes and shots and uh key s some time stamps yeah
so but you're yeah yeah i mean it it might be good to

and who has a right to put who has a right to put data on the m m m 
okay
okay yeah
yes
ah okay yeah
yeah if yo
if you have the same uh decomposition right yeah yeah but it may happen that uh for ninety fra ninety percent of the frame it's different so you see it fine but suddenly you have one other frame they don't know what it is and where it comes from
yeah yeah yeah yeah
oh you mean bac because it's it's it's the m m m  cache okay so this means
that when it's done if i go on my computer and i do the same it's not going to enter in my cache but it's going
to be already there in m m m  okay so it's th it's so it's not done on it's so
it's not done online
the first time yeah but after it's it take okay okay okay i thought it was everything was generated on the fly th so
okay
okay yeah
okay so
yeah
yeah yeah yeah
so could you say uh video name cinetis slash something or not
you th okay you think it would work okay
hmm
mm even if you would r change a c g i  for instance let's assume that we say we don't
do any scene thing then we could remove like for instance the scenes right i was thinking that here
it says that you have online video structure correction uh which means that
okay
yeah
uh this is wish wishable uh functions okay to do this
okay
okay
okay
okay no i was thinking
no because i was thinking if it's there i mean we could use it uh uh we could uh you see but uh yeah
no no fro from outside we can view them
yeah from home i was able to access them
no
okay
nobody actually it has been downloaded several times and people there are some lawyers that are putting no
but yeah y
yeah yeah yeah yeah no no yeah
no but yeah it's good to
yeah if we i yeah it might be good indeed if we start d building some experiments like this still to have a password right yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah
hmm yeah yeah what's yeah yeah
hmm
yeah it was done indeed f to be more general than just to do the shot detection so that's why the code is a bit more complex i think currently uh but uh
yeah
yeah yeah
just
yeah
ah okay yeah yeah yeah it was the same the same ones as the one you saw uh in my code yeah
yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah definitely yeah
yeah uh okay
yeah i think it's it's good yeah
okay that's good yeah
yeah
yeah but why is after i mean if there is a shot you don't know between because you dropped one frame you don't know where is the sh uh the d the shot
sliding window

yeah right
yeah
i don't know i'm i'm sure that they will be well i hope they will be a of something like this yeah
the output
yeah
this generates yeah
ho how do you generate the real media yeah
okay
oh o o oh yeah you mean the java framework uh what uh mike presented we cannot play uh real media okay
okay
formats formats yeah
okay so i think this was good to see the the tool and uh
tomorrow we are going to re say most of the things but shorter i f i believe right i mean it's
bad to explain and i think maybe later w yeah we we can start doing simple
yeah yeah yeah yeah the full uh
yeah mi this might be interesting to see tomorrow of course maybe there was the ah one hundred seventy shots or
it's a lot but uh after i mean at this point we do we have nothing
we can do unless they know what they want to do with it right
yeah yeah yeah but i think i think is it's too it's going very be very to be very good for them to visualise how you can organise things and maybe what they can do how they and so this is important
mm hmm yeah
yeah initially yeah
well we didn't because you tried to do something
okay yeah like for instance if we need to find sub shots usually it it for instance is better
to have the whole shot to decide on how to build the sub shots but it's true that maybe i
if you store all the distance at that the distances we could do some basic stuff
okay yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that's the thing yeah
ah th the gap you mean or no oh no you mean in the bhattacharya distance
yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah
okay
so
it's okay
oh yeah
you don't put your headset microphone

okay
yeah
yeah
yeah i have actually yeah the we can see the report here and the demo and the goal of uh this meeting is to present the video shot detector to olivier okay
okay so yeah it was my project um during my internship at idiap
under the supervision of jean marc and as you saw as you saw in the
email i sent uh okay i didn't send
this video is the new one i just um uh processed from
your images yeah but uh let's let's start by the video from friday
cinetis demo one
yeah
so this was uh
okay
yeah here on the left you have different things but uh as applied
so this detector uh detected the thirty shots and
if you click on uh plus button you can expand it and see the key frames that are in fact uh
five extracted frames from the shot but i think th uh
as it is it's t extracted uh without uh using sub shots uh it's simply uh five
down sam yeah down sampling um so i we can see the
video actually uh the entire video can open with real player i hope it
will work
so we don't have the the sound and it won't be grabbed the video won't uh i don't know if uh
okay it's not good quality
oh yeah yeah yeah
no no no no no no it's in real media so it's very compressed
uh okay
uh ten yeah and then there's um
okay
yes and this one yeah it's a dissolve it's a dissolve so it doesn't detect yeah when i saw the m  with m  player it's a dissolve yeah
yeah okay
yeah i don't know if this one if we see was correctly uh you see yeah
yeah
but there is a moon but okay because there is no motion in fact between the two shots
yeah okay okay
the cow yeah
mm hmm
yeah maybe to explain this method was using uh a simple uh uh distance between uh consecutive histograms and we didn't use motion features at all for that that's why i we
yeah okay
enough
yeah yeah with a sliding window
i can show you uh
yeah
yeah i don't know if we c we want to make uh use the whiteboard or here
it's uh it was uh to dis it's infra only the this
part about uh shot boundary detection is in french unfortunately but uh the this image
shows the results using motion when you s use the motion features
and here on the right is when using the histogram uh distance and
the the motion features can better show what's going on when there is such a
difficult uh transition while with the histogram um
yeah it just shows that there is a shot uh change at the end but even for dissolves
i don't have examples here but um there is not a strict uh transition
uh it's continuous for dissolves dissolves is uh yeah
yeah
no no now it's uh well for the video you saw it wa it's bhattacharya
yeah
okay set the beginning
so there is the idea is having a sliding window um
we have already all the data that is on the graph and then to detect uh the
the the the changes we we do a calculation um
with points under this sliding window within this sliding window and uh
we calculate so what do we here um
in fa we want to detect that uh this points in the middle is higher than uh
th
exactly yeah alpha alpha times the maximum of the other ones
the c
but if you are in the maximum already and at this point we check simply if uh this value is alpha times the the max of the other points let's say these points here
um i maybe for chi it's it six but uh yeah but uh for bhattacharya it's for the tests i did it two point four yeah
yeah
okay
no
mm
uh i in the the first shot yeah i saw that it was detected as a shot yeah you want to see now okay but he didn't okay
it is uh okay this is idiap laptop so you can u okay so here in fact after twelve um i don't know if it's i think it's twelve frames
yeah
oh yeah maybe you're burning but
oh there is no ha ha i didn't uh ha i didn't have time to the the real media but um yeah it's complicated
yeah here we can see that yeah
at two point four
mm
and then there is translation on the right yeah
mm mm mm
i can see uh there is another programme that can see
uh the n  uh
it's i think it's f there there are five normally
if we put expand all
yeah
the other one i had problems converting uh uh the video
into d v x  and then uh so i used the programme from uh software from sebastien
p  p a p m  to a v i  because yeah
one thing uh maybe we will talk about that is the library uh it's uh it doesn't
uh compile anymore on debian machines and yeah some maybe some work has to be done
on this i don't know why this uh image doesn't appear this is the um um
the frame that is uh uh extracted to be the shot key frame here this
one is this one the middle one so i don't know what why it doesn't appear but it just uh a simple problem
in the get frame but what i can show you now is a little programme if we want to
be um very precise about so it's
ma get frames
okay c g i  here
and we were interested in around what di do you want around six seven seconds
okay uh if we do next
oh yeah there is something wrong so it detects
yeah in fact yeah that's why i said it's it's a frame number uh w i don't know why yeah yeah yeah it's a frame number this is a frame number this is in second but i i kept the frame number
it's twelve frames zero seconds
yeah
yeah yeah so if we do every second uh i d the middle frame is uh this one thousand
okay do you thi it's another kind of browsing page but uh to be more precise about uh
to to check maybe the this yeah exactly yeah yeah anyway you go
back to one frame around f one sixty for instance i don't know
and and there is yeah that's it you know prev
okay you see that there is uh okay it's not a shot change it's a motion actually here yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah i s yeah
yeah
when you have yeah the the goal results uh then yeah in fact it's not a shot change yeah
yeah
so this would ma be made uh manually actually when you say from this shot to this shot is using a graphical user interface someone who would do manually for each video
method yeah
yeah mm
yeah
ah okay
yeah yeah yeah mm
okay
this is the one in the d v d  maybe okay we can uh see a little bit if you want to play the
well no it's okay

okay uh in fact i didn't understand that but now i understand better that cinetis wants this kind of
method to help them to restore and to apply the algori some algorithms
to to to make a better movie okay it's not for the client for the user who will uh
maybe okay okay also but okay

okay
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm yeah uh okay
okay ah okay yeah yeah yeah because he did the movie so he wants t okay to archive he wants to okay
this is yeah another mm
yeah yeah
yeah okay
mm hmm
and this could be done by through internet
mm
mm hmm
from the client point of view and from the preparation of the movie d v d  mm
okay i will play yeah
we had an arrow here or what it's
th
if i go to menu there is something
do you know what this is no old menu uh there is no menu in the d v d  okay okay
okay
so this is the same video a the the a v i  number one
and on the on the d v d  i saw that there are some other stuff
i dunno
this one
the same
okay
oops
ah okay uh there are two files okay i understand
okay
run the okay
um
yeah almost i would maybe a less a little bit less than uh a bit more than real time maybe
i will have to check but if it's five minutes videos it's like done in yeah quickly
okay
components open c v 
yeah yeah
okay
open c  yeah
yeah so that we'll use the whiteboard so in fact yeah the interface is quite
is quite simple to use um for instance you see um on the
uh on the u r l  i put okay i i disco there is m m m  dot
idiap dot c h  slash v c g i 
bin
slash video browser
okay uh slash video browser three frames
three frames dot h t m l  and then
this c g i  programme ask the mm parameter c  video and m  equals
cinetis okay demo one
in fact um i just explain how to put the data on m m m  but it's quite simple
when you log into m m m  as with a c  c  s s h  for instance um so you just put it's working like this m m m  data
video browser
uh okay slash and then
this is the name of the new directory you will create
demo one
and there stands there is couple of things well it's uh
this name so i will say this is video name so video name
dot a v i  you just because we need the a v i  so that we can uh
yeah we can do the the get frame
otherwise it's not necessary oh uh f and also for the
yeah and this is no no no uh this is done on the fly with get frame so you need that you need uh the x m l  v so it's video name
and i could data dot x m l  but in fact it's just a simple convention i w could have put nothing but i just put data the it's a convention data and then video name
okay it's r m  nine dot r m  for other stuff but in fact yeah when i think now we could have uh
only with uh extension you can you can see
the name is no of in fact yeah is is yeah yeah is the same as the directory it could have been video naming also but it's the same as a directory and that's it actually when you you u you do that
i did the same for kayak you say kayak in fact now it's kayak and then you can see
and this output yeah as your this output uh
this file is an output from the mm the software the shot boundary
detection software
it's a very simple format yeah yeah uh actually we
uh yeah i don't yeah we cannot see
it's yeah it's uh tha video scene shot it's hierarchical
in x m l  and key frame time stamp and the and from the time stamp and the
video location he knows how to get the frame each of these frames and if
we do in fact i don't know yeah it's mozilla firefox view page source okay view
frame source
and every frame is stored into uh a b a backup in
fact every frame um it's m m m  who manage
this automatically so that um when uh you ask for this frame in fact
we can okay i just view frame source
when i view image when i say view image
when i say view image on this frame up we go there and this is um
in fact it's a perl programme that outputs in fa instead of outputting h t m l 
or text it outputs uh j  peg
from the video with a time stamp it outputs a j  peg this is quite uh nice
and
yeah and this image is i this image is output uh outputted to the client
yeah exactly yeah yeah that's what i did uh
here in the other application yeah yeah i dunno
yeah here
i f there are yeah the m m m  developers so i'm part of that but uh
we could we could uh yeah it's not a problem
um i wanted to saw to see to do s say something else
um oh yeah and the images are sent to your browser the client to this browser but also
kept in uh a directory in uh on m m m 
exactly a cache i say backup but it's a cache
um that's that's how it works
no no no it's okay um for the cache uh
we have plenty of space on m m m  so the this is not a problem ah yeah for a new window
yeah exactly yeah
and it detects okay yeah so you go inside the get frame function
you see where it i it saves it and then there is a special naming convention and you can
remove the but i it's c yeah it's true
no
because there it's in cache so that if i put another video with the same name they th they will happen again they will uh appear this frames will appear
yeah yeah ex if you have the same decomposition but
but uh yeah on m m m  f now we don't have such many videos so but if you put yeah
in another directory uh then it would work or or a new naming convention with uh
special uh yeah code uh
yeah m m m  cache
yeah
but it it can go in the browser cache also
the first time is done online
yeah you can see here yeah uh the first time is done o
you know you see that well here it's it was cache because i already pressed preview but now it's on the fly so it's quite quick
this
and then if you come yeah because the images are already generated
and maybe they are on the cache of this browser this computer so okay
that's why it's yeah it was uh used with uh yeah sebastien uh did the
c  function and uh yeah and uh the the is calling this
uh c  uh executable and it was used with m m m  server with pierre a
and the beginning when yeah
um yeah yeah
oh the movies or
in fact uh we we we could you know okay you
know all these graphical user interface that you see uh okay in fact
okay mm yes yes we could do that we could put uh cinetis
slash here and then a cinetis slash is the sa yeah it works but the
uh th the point is this interface is uh i think six or seven files only x m l 
uh well it's per c g i  that output x m l  and x s l 
so it's it's not a big deal to to to make a new like a cinetis browser or
you know video browser yeah we w we copy all the files
and there is uh just one um one parameter one uh string
that we need to know where this data is and we could pr create a m m m  data video
browser uh cinetis or something else y it's uh ex extensible and
uh is
yeah
yeah exactly yeah yeah
yeah but i it's not uh it was uh you know thi this is working the expand all but uh this is uh
yeah to do list or something on a video annotation on a video structure co correction but
i it's not easy on the web with h  h t m l  pages to
to do uh such corrections like uh video structure corrections for instance for that
you need it's possible maybe uh on interfaces like flash or java
uh but still uh i i i there is uh it takes bas more work and
but i yeah yeah i mean it's good good point
well uh you we can make for for instance for t s r  t s r 
uh videos alessandro uh asked me to do the same thing and we i put
uh we had uh like a password convention so this is possible to make
for these videos so it's not
uh
well if yeah it is there is no possible productions for these videos maybe what i say i'm very tired
but uh if po yeah it's demo and uh one can say you have to guess
the name to but uh yeah
bu y yeah a good point uh about password protection issues uh or the privacy issues uh
okay uh ha yeah all the framework is ready with a t r s  t s r  videos so
usually what we do sometimes uh okay just to say something about password protections sometimes
instead of having um
a purely secure directory we p we we put a co code number
like uh so that it's quite impossible to guess instead of video m uh name equals
kayak then we would have uh zero six seven uh five or you know
two and then this directory from outside we have to take care that
okay not only the video name this u r l  is not accessible but also we
should take care that in fact m m m  it's in m m m  data video browser and this
is accessible from outside we should take care that this directory or in fact
this directory is not listable you know you cannot list from outside uh
with uh f t p  or h t t p 
yeah simple things with privacy issues but uh i there are some methods and everything
is possible to make things private i yeah i don't know if you want to add
anything but i would say that for the c  code uh yeah
i i i just want would like to stress something is that um yeah if you
want want to use the new versions etcetera i think uh we need to go a little bit through
the code and i would be happy to to to help to to for instance the classes
about video structure etcetera to put them yeah and
yeah in fact it's not there is no tosh i it was called vision lib to read uh to to extract
one frame each frame of a video you know so it wa from sebastien it was in the tosh
library but uh it's nothing w to do with tosh and it's using uh uh the
open c v  and uh some classes from uh jean marc uh for yeah bhattacharya distance
etcetera
image processing
image processing and stuff
we can forget tosh yeah
yeah
um so it's four thirty so we need one hour
it's it's good just if you want yeah this is the
parameters of the of the c  programme but uh usage
video in okay uh the output file x m l  output file dist
it's the distance um between each histogram so that if the x m l 
uh you feel there is not enough um uh shots you can instead
of reprocessing the video you you reprocess this file and also some other
stuff s for instance alpha threshold we talked about is set to two point four and
uh yeah so the uh the the step we always
use one and it should be one because otherwise it's stuck between consecutive frames
yeah but uh it doesn't w yeah it it's better to to keep it one
yeah so detection latency is about the um it's half of the
windows tha yeah sliding window
option for key frame extraction okay uh sub threshold yeah leave it to one yeah
uh yeah maybe i i will uh i will give you this file
in uh as a rhy it's a kind of rhythmia yeah i just for preparing this
uh nice discussion
m um i'm quite happy to to to do that i it's good when you do uh something that there is someone using it but uh but
at least yeah with the interface it's quite funny to to see um d that the q quickly you
can do something in in yeah in thirty t if the video i ten is ten minutes in thirty minutes
'cause it's no not a lot of things to change or even it can do it uh it can we can
do it quite automatically it can be done yeah
yeah
yeah yeah
oh yeah it
so the real media is uh yeah a parallel thing that from the a v i  you convert it into real media and it is done on windows
uh
yeah mm there is a a the free one is okay
you can use the free we have a license here at idiap but uh the
if you want to pay you pay for options such as uh resize or cropping
but in fact maybe we don't need that and uh it's called elix
producer
yeah i forgot yeah yeah uh elix producer and and that's it you can you can i it it i
yes
yeah uh yeah
and yeah with real media
well this is you can buy or you can order for free on internet no no no no
for the real media and um you didn't see but the re the real media um
is called via a real server so it's r t s p  the connection and i it's
streaming video streaming so it's not h t t p  so that it can play uh smoothly and
but we are still uh investigating for the video formats because um
i it's not supported for instance uh uh in java in java
applications uh etcetera
real media
yeah real media so there are many issues about that but yeah
it's another problem yeah
yeah that was a single video structuring but it's uh other level uh it can uh it's quite uh it's researched yeah
yeah
yeah last thing uh this is a kind of uh x m l  that is outputted so
so it's uh the structure is such as uh vi video segmentation with uh videos
in begin and then for each shot you have an i d 
well this is the terms from m  peg seven convention but anyway shot begin
and end uh a sh the shot key frame that is the middle here uh
sub shot
yeah you're right twelve frames
and in fact that's what i output in uh on the yeah i think y on the interface and there is only one sub shot because uh w yeah
there was there was problems with detecting the sub shots etcetera but uh yeah well
yeah i tr well uh not with this one but yeah i tried to code some stuff uh it but uh i'm not so confident
in the way uh it is uh coded
yeah
yeah
but we yeah even we should uh for instance for the videos uh for
the spectral clustering for the clustering here uh i store the consecutive
the distance between consecutive histograms but we could uh store the matrix that's
yeah and then uh yeah and i think i there are many possible things with uh spectral
clustering but but the uh with um there is one parameter that is very
c wha i can't remember what is the parameter uh
yeah
no no no no the in the the gap to find the the good number of clusters is so sensitive uh
yeah anyway it's it's a bit later in the in the report
so anytimes yeah i would be happy to to to help you with that
yeah yeah you can we can go
hmm
yes
mm 'kay
okay this is
okay
mm hmm
okay
okay
okay
'kay
okay

mm hmm
okay
okay
hmm
mm
okay
mm
yeah yeah
okay
yeah
okay
mm hmm
okay
'kay
hmm
yeah okay
hmm okay
okay
okay
okay
mm hmm
okay yeah okay yeah i understand okay
yeah
yeah okay
okay
okay
okay
hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
hmm
okay
yeah
okay we'll see okay
see the cut
okay
mm hmm
okay
okay
okay
okay
okay okay
hmm
yeah okay
okay
yeah okay
okay i will look to have a connection okay yeah and we need a laptop or you have yours
okay
okay
yeah
uh okay
yeah
mm 'kay
hmm
hmm
okay
hmm yeah
hmm
hmm
yeah yeah oh yeah
there was some burning
okay
and the next is eleven seconds and twelve frames
hmm
okay
hmm
okay ah okay understand
mm 'kay
mm
yeah mm hmm
okay mm hmm yeah
hmm
yeah
yeah
hmm
hmm
yeah
hmm
hmm
hmm
hmm
hmm
okay
hmm hmm
hmm
hmm
no uh i have look at the demo film and it's about uh
forty minutes and about uh
hundred and seventy three different shots so it's yeah
yes and uh i don't know if this is a real sample
d v d  because uh this will make about uh five seconds for each shot so
i think it's very short no i if this is to r to to
to make a change in the colour light and uh they have a lot of uh
shots
hmm
yeah okay
ah okay yeah okay
okay understand
yeah
okay
hmm
okay
yeah yes
yeah
hmm oh maybe they can
hmm

hmm
mm hmm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
yeah yeah
mm hmm
mm
yes

sorry
yeah
mm hmm
mm
yeah uh i think i think they made some uh special effect in this d v d 
uh there is two or three time uh you see you see the same uh
same kind of uh scene uh just uh two or three seconds
yeah
hmm
no there's no menu
there is just one uh one chapter and no menu
yeah yes yes uh
uh i think in the video there's two there's two video one is a real video and the other is a just uh introduction when you have the menu
no it's uh thirteen minutes
no but yes this is the same but uh there was a problem when do the
grab from the d v d  to the files so this is why they have make two two files
but now i have one file also in the so you can
process again one time
mm
yeah
yeah
yes
hmm
yeah
yeah
yes
hmm
hmm hmm
yeah

mm
okay
okay
okay okay yeah
yeah okay but the the name of the video file is video name is uh it's the same as a directory okay okay
okay
okay okay
yeah okay okay
okay yes okay
yeah okay
yeah okay
okay mm
okay okay so every every frame on the f page is uh online
is is a
okay
yeah yes
okay
okay
okay
okay understand
yes okay okay but on the on the on the server the original is a f video film okay
so for example you can change you can change a number to take which one okay okay understand in the other yeah yeah okay perfect
in this one okay

yeah i think it's not well done yeah
yeah
okay
but um
yeah
okay okay there is li local cache okay okay okay okay okay
so if we for example now we have the c the the case that this video is not correct because uh
i have make uh event grabbing so uh we need to remove the cache for
this video or this is automatic
yeah
yeah but what i mean is i i i i i if i if i put the same video with the same name instead of this one they should uh different
ah okay we need to remove them
yeah okay okay understand okay yeah it's not a real uh usi usage okay
okay yes understand okay
yeah
yes bec because this one i was uh
th this one was
yeah
right okay okay but it's okay it's okay
okay
yeah yeah
hmm hmm
mm
on the m m m  yeah
mm
hmm hmm
yeah
yeah okay oh it's greek but uh okay
okay so i if you come back now you
yeah yeah okay but now you have s you have both cache yeah okay
yes computer too yes to uh but okay but it's fast
okay
yeah understand
okay
okay uh i ju just uh a question on the the
organisation of the m m m  so you don't have uh a part for
specific uh project every for example if we make a lot of
uh film uh for cinetis uh all are on the top
i mean uh all the film are y you you don't have a separation for the film for cinetis or for the project and s
well you say video name equal all are on the same level
okay okay
okay okay
yeah okay
ah okay to make
okay if we need to make some special thing on the browser it's t
okay
yeah okay it's okay
okay great
okay mm
okay
work in progress

yeah
input
no
yeah uh mm
yeah mainly the t webpage or for output
yeah okay
and all these uh file are only uh internal
this mean uh if i go t on uh c cintetis cinetis uh
from outside of idiap we can access this
with a password or
mm
yeah
yeah
okay yes okay okay
yeah
yeah okay
yeah okay
yeah yes yeah okay
okay
hmm
yeah okay
uh
yeah yeah yeah yeah i understand yeah yeah okay
yeah
yeah okay
right okay yeah
okay
hmm
okay
yeah
yes
hmm okay yeah
hmm
yes
yeah okay and the code is based on open c v 
oh okay
okay
okay
bhattacharya okay and so on okay okay
okay okay
so we can forget tosh and uh use uh input se the input reader for the the m  peg we can re lo use uh open c v 
okay
okay
hmm
it's good
yeah
yeah
yes
output hmm
uh yeah
okay
okay
okay yeah
yeah yeah okay
ah okay
okay we can skip some frames okay yeah
okay
yeah yeah yeah
mm hmm
okay okay it's perfect
hmm
yes
yes yes
yeah
mm

yeah the the browser hmm hmm
yes yes uh so just uh last question maybe uh
so this makes a x m l  file okay this is the the programme to to generating the x m l  file
and the the shot and uh with the kayak you have one problems you don't have the
real media so this is another thing
okay
okay
okay
so you have some special tools from uh from real media okay
hmm
mm
okay hmm
hmm okay okay
okay i heard it
okay
but uh anyway you need you need to have windows to make these
so i will ask you or someone else okay
okay okay understand
okay but this is this is made by a programme done outside idiap okay
this is yes right okay this not uh idiap programme okay okay
hmm
yeah
yeah okay
yeah mm
um
hmm
hmm
hmm
hmm
okay
mm
okay thank you
okay yes
i think for test i can take the real demo and make the the full processing
so i will
yeah
yeah
yeah
okay
hmm
okay
mm okay
i have some informations

okay and uh in this in this the begin and end the number is the
for example the end is zero dot twelve twelve is uh this
frame too yeah okay
okay okay
okay
okay
what what
okay
uh okay
mm
just what what
hmm
yeah okay okay
it's okay
yeah that's me
mm
there's also a watch moves around a great deal more
mm
mm hmm
mm
um i'm actually gonna be bold and go oo go straight for rubber um for reasons i'll go into uh in more detail
mm
yep now i'm gonna have to work between the uh the slides and the uh
and the white board 'cause i actually i have some fairly concrete things
this time uh um i was given a
an h t m l  file giving um various ideas from uh from other previous remote
control designs and pretty much decided to just dump them all i wasn't very impressed by them and they didn't seem
to re uh nothing i saw seemed to meet the sorts of design specifications that we're going for today um
so what i ra rather than looking at other remotes uh ra oomp be better to simply look at the human hand
um and try and f um and try and figure out a way of laying out the elements we've already decided on um
so that if r a if so that the finger is e each finger or thumb is wherever it needs to be already
um so uh next slide if you please um and what we've
basically decided on was the the um the joy uh the joystick two function
buttons and the l c d  just keep it paired down to the absolute minimum
i don't actually think we need the um the numeric keypad because
if you m because one of the menus that we could have available um v via via the
l c d  is one where you scroll through channels so if there's something f and
be bear in mind since this isn't meant to work for um
f f f for di for digital or um or for or for cable whatever
you're basically looking at four or five terrestrial channels and then um
your v c  uh and then the channel through your v c r  and or d v d  player and or um
box so it's not i'm not really excessively concerned about that
you must have two two modes basic mode where um the joystick's uh left right left
right for channels up down for volume um and the uh uh and the menu mode
for uh further functions um now the reason i was particularly interested in using rubber
for this is that if we're going to have a highly ergonomic design um it needs to be ergonomic for left or right
handed people um so you
mm hmm
yes absolutely um basi basically what i
basically what the what be having um i would say the the whole thing articulated
at two points so that if you if you're handing it from a lef uh left or right handed user you can adjust it so that the
um the l c  the l c d  and the uh
the joystick would be in the right place
and also this is a rather nicer de uh design gimmick that the the um you know the whole thing you know it should have sort of organic feel to it that it should be you know soft to touch and
can be moved around all nice um okay on to on to the next uh to the next slide
okay
yeah 'kay basically um
i can add pretty pictures to this the um
assuming the hand the hand to be in about sort of this position um
hol uh holding the remote the um the joystick unit should rest over the uh
the joint of the f of the uh four finger so that it's directly accessible for the thumb um
and it would need t there would need to be a it would need to be articulated just below that so that it could be switched around
for uh left or right handed users so
you then have a grip section that can be more or less the same irrespective
of handedness you just have big two big buttons that cover most of the area so it can
in the upper part one for the four finger one for the middle finger um and that
th this part here is the joystick this would be the actual grip
probably where you'd want to have the battery as well that would be probably the bulkiest part
and you then have at the uh at the bottom the l c d  and this would need to be articulated
as well and basically i'd want this to rest here right at the base of the wrist so it would fit just nicely
in the hand and again this part could be
rotated so it can
so so so that it can be adjusted to either left or right handed user um
so the t uh the top function button in basic mode would be the on off switch and menu mode
would be the enter button and then the bottom function buttons switches between between modes um now programming
it actually thi this is one thing i've found with um the replacement remote control programming
them can be a right pain so i thought th the simplest way around that would be to have um
a cable to connect it to the computer some some fair iv fairly fairly simple software on the computer
just so that you on your computer just so that you could um pr program it at a rather in
a rather more comfortable interface and you could download programs for it from uh
for uh t v s from all sort of main manufacturers um though you
i it would be necessary to have uh have a m uh have a ha have
a mode for programming it without the computer uh just in case there are there are still people
left out there who don't have them yet um but uh yeah
that's that's my idea
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah actually if you've got a lot of channels the number keypad can be quite annoying as well becau it's
you know if you're trying to remember what uh you know what number's the discovery channel or whatever it's
just irritating but if you h but but but if you have a me but if you have a menu structure then you can sub group them
so you
yeah
yeah i i would say definitely i mean i mean i mean the the
idea of having it sort of articulated i th there would be basically two points of articulation
w um one below and one above the m the uh the main sort of grip
so
mm
i d i don't thi i don't think that it would be a a structural weakness i mean if you have a firm s sub structure
you can then incorporate articulation into that if you then have a sort of outer skin of
mm flexible spongy rubber then you have something that is you know very much you know
organic and i think would look rather co i mean mi rather cool i mean my drawing there doesn't doesn't do it justice it makes it makes it look more a little bit more like a vibrator than a than a uh than a remote control but uh

mm hmm
make it harder to lose as well
i th uh i mean if it i think that's something that could perhaps be programmable though maybe have monkey as default um
mm hmm
well basi basically the um for f for uh i mean e each
manufacturer will have a partic will have a particular command set that uh the t v  responds to it's
not simply a matter of frequency so um
usually what's done is you have this big booklet full of different possi you'll
have all of them sort of programmed in to the uh remote and you'll have this little booklet of codes
you then find your um ma uh find your manufacturer and try
the different codes that
come under that manufacturer's name 'til you find the right one it's
yeah that's right so that's that's quite annoying and we probably would still have
to do that but if we had um some sort of hook up to your computer as an option
then if you've got a computer you can avoid that
rather irritating thing
yeah
yeah
um booklet some pages
yeah
yeah but it's a but it's a nuisance and it's a nuisance very close to the to um
to actually purchasing it so it's something that you're likely to be thinking about if you if there's w i if
there's one in the shop that's that says it can avoid much of that nuisance you might be
favourably inclined towards it um mm
mm
um well i i think other than ge getting a sort of more aesthetically
pleasing form for it um mo most of the sort of
layout design decisions are are made i would say um
but then again the um the menu structure to to a considerable
extent that's gonna vary according to the model of television and also any customisations that
the user might wish to incorporate so um and one of the nice things about having an
l c d  and a menu structure is that there is that flexibility to it
yeah
mm
yeah i mean it's
yeah
yeah the other thing i mean it i mean it would need to ha it would need to have um
some sort of on board memory anyway um f for one for one thing because
i do think that the menu system should be um uh i mean although you know it's not going to be
terribly complicated if it's just controlling one device the menu system ought to be um
o ought to be customisable and uh
mm hmm how uh how uh how you want say the um the the menu structure for flicking through channels if you've got lots of channels that sort of thing
yeah
are we going to be supplied with the clay is what i want to know where is the clay
mm hmm
mm
i th i think i would largely want to actually steer clear of the whole sort of fruit and veg thing
bu but um but the spongy idea i like i like it a lot

i having it i having it sort of br bright yellow i think that's quite a good idea though maybe we could have options for colours as well
and again this has the advantage of being harder to lose
mm hmm
mm
yeah i was like like i said before i i think we should have the r r  on the uh on the top function button
alright yeah crack on okay so we'll start off
with a quick overview of the minutes i think to sum up the last meeting would be to say um
the requirements that we've um set out those are we were going to go for what seemed to be a fairly
minimal design based on uh a small joystick
l c d  and a couple of other buttons for navigation um with
power being i suppose one of the main single purpose buttons um we were also going to use novelty
of being able to locate the remote control again via a small transmitter with any luck the idea
to try and separate us and also because of the minimal design
um looks like we'll be able to be fairly adventurous in the actual physical shape of our remote control
with any luck um that pretty much sums up the last one so
we'll just crack on um like to maybe start with the industrial designer if it's possible
um uh the con today is the concep today this uh meeting is the
conceptual design phase and is um
sorry about this and is to cover things like
um what the parts might be made of um can we uh outsource
these from elsewhere um will we have to construct any items ourselves
yeah okay well i'll just uh i'll load it up then um
which one do y
oh interface concept that's you we've got trend watching that's you
components design
okay
okay
okay
now the kinetic one we've 'cause that's the ones where like you the movement
causes it um the bat uh the battery for a a watch wouldn't require a lot of
power would be my one query is a kinetic one going to be able to supply enough
power
do you think
w
which i suppose as well would allow us to go off the shelf again you'd say

um um
curious um i don't know if you'd be able to off the top of your head or not the single curved and double curved would you be able to
give an example um could you maybe draw something i you don't doesn't have to
be perfect it's just 'cause i'm not quite sure if i understand the difference between the two
so it might literally just be okay
alright
mm
okay that was definitely something we can talk about um so you've got a little bit about the the chip that we might require as well
um do you have any idea so far like when we're saying that we'd need an advanced chip for an l c d  does that in shoot the cost up by a drastic amount or
well i think compared to say just pressing buttons
if you press a button that sends a certain transmission through the infra red whereas
i think if we're controlling the l c d  we definitely require a much more powerful chip just compared to the
chip you would use for pushing buttons i think is the the point being made if i've not over stepped yeah
okay um should i go on or go back
well we'd also be relying on the um the bulk buying in producement and such i assume we have to look into the costs of those so sorry
okay
okay um
so in the information that you've been supplied how feasible would you say that the idea of using an l c d  looks
um i mean that sounds like quite a good requirement to me um conventional battery would seem to make sense um
i'm not sure if there's any cost differences between single and double curved and i'm i don't know about anybody else but
plastic or rubber as a traditional form of casing would seem to be a good way forward
okay
okay well um
yeah well will we move on to user interface and yeah um
sorry as long as were you yeah okay um and
d d d interface concept
yeah
can i just jump in slightly there that would suggest the double curved design's probably going to be most appropriate then
okay
mm
okay um yeah
just to let you know we'll probably be quite tight for time as well because i think you've probably got a lot you'd like to say i guess
okay

excellent right um uh file open
trend watching
okay

okay
mm hmm
mm hmm
okay
well um i would say that the most you could probably hope for is gaining a year's lead on most people anyway you always have to bring out new designs so if we can get next year then that's possibly a good place to start anyway um
seems like a a lot of the components could be off the shelf so i don't exactly what cost would be incurred
um i can see your point about the number keypad but i've i would
say that we can probably incorporate it into the menu system if you need to do traversal of a large number of channels
my feeling would be that even if at a later date this was to be taking control of um boxes as well
um having the use of the l c d  and the joystick would probably allow you to manipulate enough channel numbers for you to be
mm hmm
okay
so what it looks like to me is we'll use a large number of standard components um
say something like um lithium ion battery the kind that you find in most um small hand held devices now um
looks like we going for a double curved design um i don't know what cost implications there are in that
um looks like we're pretty much decided on some kind of flexible rubber though i'd have to
say depending on how flexible it is we might need to have some kind of inner frame
do you think there's any way we could maybe remove the articulation i can see why it looks appealing but it could be a weak point in um the structure do you think that would be a worry of mine

yeah we won't add that functionality
however one interesting point is i don't know how serious you were there but we if we take some of the ideas why don't we make the damn thing yellow to incorporate the des the colour of the logo
i dunno it's an certainly a different colour from your average um
that's true was there anything in your research


mm hmm
an interesting point is that if the person doesn't have the computer we can still make the process easier
because instead of having to look up codes maybe we can have it that one of the options they have is that they look up the name
of the company on the l c d  and then they maybe look up different names of um different actual
units that have been produced or we have the remote control just go through them until it's like
does this do the correct function and such
doesn't have to be used very often that's right yeah
okay this just to give us a rough idea of what we're meant to be doing for the next stage i'm pretty sure that you got that anyway this is the conceptual one um
i think we've come up i think we've covered everything we need to here um i think we've decided on what you know
decided on standard items for most of um rubber and such so we're now looking at the detailed design and what
we need to be doing for the next meeting um
so for example um i'll just start at the top you've got yourself and the industrial designer gonna be working quite closely at this stage 'cause it'll be hard not to obviously um
looking from prototyping of some des description using clay um i suppose you'll be told a lot more about that as uh progress um
the user interface design
they're kind of it looks they're the idea i've pushed forward so far is maybe more of a
physical one there whereas possibly be more interested in maybe how the l c d 's going to incorporate do you think
or do you s perceive that most the design design decisions still need to be based on the physical layout
mm hmm that's very true
um
okay um got product evaluation as well um
i i think we'd be yeah no it'd be more a case of how do we envisage us performing the product evaluation once we have a model to test with
um so it'd be a case of do you think that just bringing users in to have them test it out uh
maybe putting a certain number of products into the field in certain places which i suppose is quite similar or just
kind of hitting the streets and you know saying this is a new remote control what do you think of the look of it
um
i think the target audience is pretty much anybody under the age of say maybe
sixty or something ludicrous um the reason i'm saying that is we're just looking at a a
replacement remote control something that's stylish so maybe you're even just maybe you're narrowing down your target audience
simply by saying
if they're buying it that often or they're maybe looking to replace something then they've got a bit of free cash so that puts them potentially in the younger age bracket maybe even single just for the reasons of um uh excess cash flow
although of course i mean at twenty five euros i don't think we're looking at charging the earth for the uh device think that's well within the normal
bracket um your idea of the u s b  would i think would largely depend on the cost
u s b 's definitely one of the cheapest interfaces out there but it might push the cost of the overall unit up
'cause it would require not just the connection but the chip for communicating with the rest of the system
that one might have to be based on
the the idea was that maybe it could connect up for um allowing a software interface on the p c  for a larger programming due to the fact that we've gone for such a nice easy minimal design normally
um
it's just for t v  but for
programming it to use your t v  you might hook it up to the p c  i i'm not sure but i'm thinking maybe that the additional cost of the u s b  might be prohibitive we don't know unless it would make sense to
mm hmm w
it would make sense to i would say to um and we'd better be careful about the time as well we've already had the five minute warning so um i would say yeah
international would make sense um you're gonna look at product evaluation i'm i'd better start writing up a hell of a lot
of crap um you're gonna look a bit more at the kind of the physical make up you say um
looks like we're gonna need a maybe a kind of prototype in clay uh we'll see how that
goes um
so um do i think we've got an idea of where we need to go for the next meeting would you say
yeah i would s that would be my my feeling

we seem to have quite a general consensus that the idea of the the r rubber could be quite
yeah so we always need to remember that somewhere we're meant to be getting the slogan on
possibly i'm think i'm not sure but i'm seeing a little bit of space around maybe the joystick area which could be used um
okay and i think that says it all really right see everybody in a half hour
uh
cost is
yeah
yeah
yeah
titanium the really strong metal titanium is it not also it's expensive
two curves
need an advanced chip for the l c d  is that did i
advanced like three eight six advance
okay
okay sure
mm if we only have twelve pounds fifty
twelve euros not even twelve pounds twelve euros what's that like eight pounds or something like that nine pounds
okay that's good point
i also have a preference for rubber
based on my research
digital
is this the joystick
okay
mm
mm
'kay
we go
okay

so uh to gather my research two basic methods we compared uh whether
people want the remote control to do a lot of stuff or they want it to look cool and then we we research
uh fashion trends in europe what's what's the new black you know as it goes
next slide please
uh we found in order of importance people want the remote control to look cool more than they
want it to to be cool as in they want it to do a lot of good s they want it to look like it does a lot and if it does
do a lot that's a bonus but they don't care so much you know they want it to be that's sounds a bit
like a contradiction
technology technical technologically innovative people want it to be that but
s still they care more about the way it looks than what it does so like the interface is really important
and easy to use it it just so happens that uh from the second point to the third point
is twice as important i mean the second point is twice as important as the third point people want it
i is it has to be cooler than easy to use you know if it has the newest features even if it's difficult to use prefer
it to have the newest features and if it's easy to use that's a bonus the fashion now this is
seems a bit odd to me but fruit and veg is the new is the new black for furniture for clothes
for shoes
how that relates to a remote control i don't know but i i see i come on to that in the next in the next slide
spongy i've als i've been saying everything's the new black well spongy's the new black as well so we have the choice between rubber and plastic
if it's the type of rubber that you can squeeze you know it's spongy then can i skip the rest
okay
okay so kinda spongy material so um so my personal opinion
um we want something fancy and techni technologically innovative obviously but
what we what we need is something that looks like it's from the future that looks cool that's that's different you know that's
everyone has a white remote control black remote control you need something cool like titanium is cool but it's
expensive and maybe it's a bit of overkill for a remote control
um now the fruit and veg options either we we go in that direction or we stay totally away from
it um i mean the research did come up with fruit and veg so maybe it is important for it's the up to the interface
guy so if we stay away from it s you know stay away from it but if we're gonna go along
with it then it doesn't necessarily have to be like an apple or something like that or a kiwi fruit it could be something
like
i say potato peeler but i'm sure you guys have a have a much cooler idea than i do so i think
cool is the key few questions about a spongy remote control i've never seen
one before i've seen plastic remote controls i think maybe they were
i don't know back in the day when they first came up with remote controls they had a reason for it being
sturdy you know for being strong and sturdy so um if we want something strong and sturdy i say
stay with plastic or titanium but if we go with spongy we can stress that you can drop this
as many times as you want it doesn't matter it's spongy material it's not gonna break you know i just don't know how the l e d 
and the lights are gonna fit into a spongy material because it's not gonna be completely squeezable
so how do things fit it
and if we are gonna use spongy we can say it's long lasting you know it's damage resistant
and stuff like that so so just to summarise people want stuff that's cool that's that
looks like it's cool and if it is cool then that's a bonus doesn't have to be um people
like fruit and veg we can either go down that alley or stay totally away from it people like
spongy material if we're gonna use spongy material we have to think of how practical it is and how we can further promote
that idea and also this was this year
so things change all the time every year you know they they always talk about this year this is the new black well next year something else is gonna be the new black and we're stuck with last year's fruit and veg type stuff 'kay
that's me
that's a good point you can incorporate names into the menu
okay even news music like they do on uh sky digital kinda yeah

okay course not
sure yeah
sure
the noise for when you lose the banana um f yeah for when you lose the remote control
it could be like a a monkey noise or something like that rather than a standard beep beep y you know you lose the
monkey the banana
y you lose the banana you press a button and you hear like monkey screams or something like that to direct you towards the banana
s oh i was gonna talk about the programmable remote control now i think it'd be cool if you had one remote control that could work with all t v s you know you s you click a button and it finds the frequency that
works with your particular television but why you'd need to program it like as as a standard feature i i don't know
yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
that's because televisions they don't give the remote control any type of feedback when you send it okay
is it is it actually a book of names to digits or is it like a few pages

i was just thinking if we were to store this information some type of mapping
this person probably need to use this feature like once you know when you first buy the remote control or whenever they buy a new television so once every s
yeah and it's
mm
mm
mm
yeah you see i don't some of these things kinda logically follow the others how can t product evaluation doesn't that come after actually seen
a product prototype
oh that's the okay sure sure sure
mm hmm
okay sure
at this stage we still have no no target audience or
'kay
and it's stylish
mm hmm
mm
yep okay
programmable memory as well
for the remote control
we've w definitely talking some type of
different
but you're gonna need some type of flash memory or something well something that doesn't you wouldn't have to redo the whole thing once the batteries are changed you know once you turn off the power
yeah
different languages uh different skins and stuff like that
sure i if it was customisable as in different languages and stuff that does open it is supposed to be international right so
it would make sense if you could
okay

yeah
the fruit and veg
this one

yeah
yeah
yeah
sure i mean we are trying to promote a remote control but we wanna keep the company brand as well so
i think so too
sa
uh uh okay i'll just
uh i have a presentation i just saved it in the uh the folder
uh
it's uh
components design
alright so
uh
the case uh le that's what i wrote first of all could be plastic our plastic uh but later
on we found out that um it can be rubber as well or titanium or even wood
so uh we decide what it's gonna be probably plastic uh
we need the infra red transmitter get that off the shelf uh joystick we'll probably if we're gonna use it um could be
plastic w or rubber even as well um
if you go on to the next slide uh
if you go on to f uh findings it's like two or three slides down
right so this is what i found we can use uh
three different types of batteries um
can either use a hand dynamo or the kinetic type ones you know that they use in watches or else uh a solar powered one
um
yeah
uh
yeah i don't think it would um
and solar cells i dunno about that
uh
we should probably just use conventional batteries
um
just like in usual remote controls
um
yeah
um
and these are three different types of or two different types three different types of shapes you can have uh one is a flat one
and then more original ones are single curved one or one with a double curved um
the materials are tha there as you can see but uh you can't have a titanium one for a double curved
uh which would be
yeah and light
uh i think so as well yeah they make mountain bikes out of that don't they so it's really light as well
um
t yeah
uh
well
for a curved well i was thinking to f for to sit in your the palm of your hand uh maybe like this with the uh joy pad here joystick here and maybe
um
an okay button around here so that the thumb can uh use it quite easily um i don't exactly
double curved it probably means this is probably double curved uh whereas a single curved would be
like that
i guess
or not necessarily
yeah like that whereas this is two curves um
so i guess that's what they mean by uh double curve um which obviously it looks better than the single curve but uh you can't have it in titanium which is
uh
a nice material
uh
and for the buttons um it can have the scroll wheel which they use in mouses for com p c s uh but
um it requires a
more expensive chip to use and if you wanna use l c d  it's even more expensive so you have to decide there's trade offs there um
if you want the buttons to be oh yeah if you have a double curve uh control and it's rubber then
you have these rubber buttons as well but you're gonna ha i reckon you're gonna have to have
uh key a number keypad anyway for the amount of channels these days you wouldn't want to just
have to scroll through all the channels to get to the one you want you wanna enter just the number of it if you know it so
um i reckon we're gonna have to have a number keypad anyway
do you think
yeah
so
depends where
gonna spend the money
if you want the f fancy l c d  display
yep
yeah i
um

uh the previous slides just explain what's in the internal components of the uh
remote control if you go to the one before that uh so it just says what it does translate the key press into an
infra red signal and this is received by the t v  uh the chip just needs to detect
the signal or detect the key press and then uh it'll send it to the tr the amplifier
and uh then the next slide just shows how the uh copper wires
uh interact with the buttons the rubber buttons uh
to uh get sent to the chip
so that's just how the control works inside
um we have to decide on what
buttons we're gonna use
um
i think we can do it if uh we use conventional batteries and not have solar cells or kinetic um and then
maybe use single curved uh case
because we might need it to be curved for the uh
thumb to use the joyst joystick easily um
and then you'll need the advanced chip obviously for the l c d 
yep i'm finished
ah okay
oh yeah i forgot to mention that the uh rubber material is the type of stress ball material not just normal rubber forgot to say that
yeah

if you're going with the fruit and veg thing looks like a banana
f if you wanna design it that way

yeah
okay
yeah

monkey
the u s b  for which
oh right okay
but didn't they just say it's just for t v  or are we gonna
okay yeah
they're going with the fashion thing like the design spongy rubber yeah
all set cool
alright it is powerpoint time
i've done more powerpoints in this particular experiment than i've ever done in my life before this experiment which is kind of fun
so uh here we have our detailed design meeting where we will um look at the prototype
and um right so um i finally figured out what this whole second
bullet point is about in my that my coach was sending to me it means i'm supposed to read the minutes from the previous meeting
i think i don't know otherwise it's just saying i'm the secretary and i'm
therefore i'm taking the minutes s so just to go um just real briefly to go over minutes from last
meeting uh i will open them slowly no
wait for it wait for it

no that's how the
wait
this is this is very high powered stuff here double clicking there we go so um
basically the moral of the story from our last minute uh last meeting was that um we that we had
meetings from uh we had presentations done by the industrial designer uh or from nathan and ron and from sarah about
what we can do here um and what
sort of limitations we're operating with um uh excuse me what limitations we're operating under what kind
of risk we'd be looking at with some of the various approaches we were discussing and we essentially came to the conclusion that
we should develop a remote with uh voice recognition i e  that had a vaguely non remote like shape um
because you didn't really need to use it as a remote since you could just use your voice that would include some mostly just
the simple design features for a television operation but with a slide or a fold out bay for more advanced functions
for users um and uh the uh uh the u i d  and the i d  were
asked to go ahead and start developing a prototype for us to look at so
that's sorted back to the main

meet here um go ahead and take it away guys
mm hmm


nice
perfect

oh right



oh well done yeah yeah oh ok



edible televisions it's a wave of the future
brilliant

brilliant

cool
no no i think that's


right yeah thanks guys that's very very good work i like it brilliant
um what we need to discuss now is the finance of it um i got me you've
got you provided a number that actually sounds quite nice um the trouble is i was just
given this by finance um it's a spreadsheet of the parts and i've just tentatively put
in what it's going to look like um i'm just gonna clear this out real quickly but it looks
like
so we'll just if we can just itemize what's in here we've got this it's a solar cell thing right
with a back up battery
with the ba okay um and
clever clever well done um so i guess that would mean we've got a bit of a um
it's a s a speaker and a sensor at the same time isn't it
okay
um and the case it's more of a single curved case i guess would be that be the general
um and we've got a rubber skin material basically throughout um push button interface
um with this other drop down so maybe we've got two push button interfaces don't we
um
and um a special
i guess it's uh we've got a sort of a wood materi a rubbery type material that throughout yeah

yeah it's it's quite unique i like it yeah it's
so it looks like
a bit over budget um
so what we could do perhaps a simple fix would maybe to switch away from the solar cells
um or take out the back up battery uh
mm hmm mm hmm
hmm

what's difficult we have all these things integral to the um to the design of it that we just can't back out of now it would have to be seems like we'd have to go back to
square one
in a way um if we were gonna try to undo one bit we'd probably have to undo most of it um
it's either or
'cause we can't remove the push buttons 'cause they're um and we can't get rid of the uh i mean removing the changing the case wouldn't be so much of a
mm mm um nor would changing the case materials
um so yeah that looks like to be the only thing so that would be the it's a major change but
yeah
alright so we're in agreement on that
right
moving along swiftly um so i guess now we just go to the project evaluation
which i will allow sarah to take over
ah of course sorry
whoosh
that'd be great


brilliant
hmm
um yeah i was just go on
well they don't own tellys anyway do they
right so um this one's a bit unclear
to me to be perfectly fair um i got this slide from the coach and
i'm not sure what it's connected to um so i guess we are going to discuss um our
project process um and that is gonna go into my report so i guess this is the point
where we go um uh out of role it looks like
and talk about our satisfaction for room for creativity and so forth and how that all worked i guess
um
i think so yeah
i think it's
i mm hmm i think so
i think hope i'm not screwing up an experiment
but i trust that she would jump in if i was so okay fair enough um right um so any thoughts
yeah
what do you guys feel about the process

mm hmm
no no whiteboard

was pretty cool tack though




attempts to contact coach ineffective

very natural look
that's the brilliance of they had a p they had a peeler in here


yeah i think yeah re i thought it was like really creative actually i mean
including the s the multi coloured wave pattern


what did you guys think about the the the roles

that's true i i got this spreadsheet
of what to do
mm mm
cool
she said i i i she actually made a comment off boy you're getting into this and i really i think it's true i did get i i felt like i got way too into it
i felt like i slipped into it a lot
i dunno
the first time i've ever done anything like yeah project project management i usually organise crap it's one thing to do you know set up a party with your friends you know
but you guys felt that you could keep the yeah suspension of disbelief kind of like like the role and the okay
yeah yeah
maybe in in legos you know be fun with legos too like make a remote control or spaceship we used
to have spaceship legos did you guys ever used to build spaceships with legos everybody knows
best spaceships ever um you guys felt like there was enough teamwork in all
hmm
no i no i dunno i d i i dunno i don't i i was just i
it's true huh
yeah
yeah course i'm i'm conscious of the idea of the project manager asking if you guys feel like there's a team you know it's like kind of like like hmm it d
but yeah interesting it's kind of fascinating wasn't it i mean the whole process of
i don't know i i don't know if there was a ri i th
mm
nor i
i wanna see the output files from these um from the digital paper i wanna see wh wh what my my handwriting looks like digitized because my handwriting is crap i mean just to see what it looks like in p d f  format or something

t i i'm curious about what the de briefing is gonna be like you know like what is the uh
what exactly we're looking for here
i dunno i'm not sure what the new ideas found i is about
well that's the thing i got i in the email i got this powerpoint file but this slide was just there mm hmm i didn't change this one at all
um ch
yeah well
w i kinda like th
yeah you can't
yeah
does kinda make you wonder i mean how much can you do with a remote control it's like inventing a new car yeah yeah you can
yeah
hmm
um 'kay
so this was other costs
i dunno i think this is
forty ish i i i mm we should go on a bit yeah about the project eval um
i dunno about you guys but i felt like
a bit
under stimulated on the whole thing like what like you know what am i really doing you know what is
yep
hey
mm
i actually didn't do that at all though every single one i a all the presentations i either added slides or edited 'em i di
oh
what really
did they not have they didn't like uh mine yeah they didn't come like this like with this was what it looks like this is what that looked like literally just like that interesting
uh huh huh huh
interesting
any other thoughts come to mind



yeah but

builds
mm


interesting


uh yeah i'd say so
mm i know
it seemed like everything flowed pretty logically you know from the the the basics to the conce although the whole
concepts thing the whole concepts phase i don't think i really understood like the concept well
the id okay the notion of yeah i mean i it's not like i have a concept of a mug's material it's
just it is what it is you know maybe i rather than concepts i it should be th thought of we sh i i
thought of i thought of rather than in terms of concepts i thought of it in terms of um like
proposed idea and then the final would be like th the actual specified prototype or whatever i dunno but
all in all it's kinda interesting
no just this closing one no we've established that the costs weren't really within budget but we could s you know do it
we did the project evaluation based on um sarah's evaluation of on off switches and
mm true
yeah
'cause we di we had a thu think about it um
yeah
and it's all recorded woo hoo yeah what i'm gonna i'm gonna put um i'm supposed to do this final report thing at the end so i'll put
all that into the final report as well or as much as seems like maybe not like the articles
and stuff like because and if and so forth but i'll put most of it in the reports
nice
oh yeah
there's a whole branch of psychology that looks into that psycholinguistics
yep they're called um disfluencies
yeah we like our fancy phrases and terminologies for things
exactly uh i will save this into the
project documents
yeah oh yeah yeah i know come on give me some information well to be fair we're we're hooked we're all hooked on the internet so i mean i do the
i know imagine we went the first ten y fifteen years of our lives without the internet it's only in the last ten that we're like where's the internet i mean you know it just in the past five we've gone from twenty eight eight modems to broadband all the time
no we have but i not in the sense that it's so un you know uh ubiquitous
mm
yeah that's our last step celebration
'kay i guess we can probably call that meeting to an end for the most part cool
where do you find that
is this one of those media player
w oh the default track i thought it was david burns look into the eyeball that's one that seems to be shipping with it uh shipped with for a while maybe this is the new version
yeah i guess we'll call that a a doner fab
yeah
oh really okay

well uh we have assembled our prototype
um what's to be said about it um we took into account a lot of the things that
we went over in the last meeting um some of the most important things to consider are that
we decided not to go for the touch screen which you can see and opted for some very large
buttons for the primary functions um
this is going to be the on off button and we have these buttons to go through the channels um
and then two volume buttons down here d uh we decided those were the most important uh buttons
and then for the more advanced uh functions there is a slide out panel here
um and you can see that there are lots of other things going on but this actually can slide back in and provides a very
nice aesthetic when it's all put away um
as far as the uh whole visible light thing we decided to go with the multiple colours coming out why not
of course if that's annoying for some people that function can be turned off um
go ahead


that's this here
um i worried about the materials it is uh the entire thing is covered in a rubber coating so it's very durable uh it's not gonna break like some types of plastic that's dropped
um and of course as you can see and if you touch it it does have that nice squishy feel

fact i dunno if you noticed but i wrote the uh the company's name on the telephone screen i thought that was kinda nice this was actually an apple on the inside this
yeah we got a bit ahead of ourselves i know we're not talking about making televisions at this point or anything like that but
right
uh we did yeah this cost well to put this into um production we're looking at about what was our goal it was twelve fifty euro um and this actually came in at about eleven ninety nine
um so i was quite pleased with that one thing that we didn't do um obviously we had a choice
with the buttons whether to use scroll buttons or standard rubber buttons but we just went for a classic rubber button
and um since we did that we didn't have to use as many microchips which was quite nice and that's what helped keep
the cost down so even though it has a lot of modern technology um for example
the voice recognition in a lot of ways it's just a simple remote and um i think
if we shopped around for other manufacturers um we might be able to
get even cheaper
and
oh no we haven't talked about that yet have we
hmm yeah
any questions
um do you wanna answer this one or do you want me to answer it
yeah yeah
um well as you can see this is just a most superficial layer and um it'd be very easy to put another layer of something else like
it's not it's not quite a a face plate it's more like a pseudo face plate because
it's simple enough that in the factory it could we could very easily put a different one on it it locks into place
such that you know it's pretty permanent but at the same time if we wanna go the other way
it's just a matter of a couple of adjustments and we could go the face plate way if you know what i mean
yeah
oh
ooh
right uh we didn't really touch on that but it it's in there yep
yeah yeah it's just making use of the same space and the same materials but
yeah one big curve i guess you could say
yeah mm hmm
yeah special and s i guess you have to mark special colour and special form as well don't you 'cause it i it is very unconventional i like to think of it as unconventional
oh huh doesn't match up does it
how do you feel about that
i mean we could take we could take the battery out of it you see and it'd probably work ninety nine per cent of the time but you're
gonna have to set up a call centre for that one per cent of the time when people are calling and saying oh look my remote isn't working
what am i gonna do people'd be real upset i think in the long run it's better to keep the battery
it's hard to scrap the whole cell battery idea 'cause that's so integral to the theme that we have
yeah
hmm
right
right
yeah i guess we might have to do that it's the only way we're gonna get below our uh goal isn't it of twelve fifty
yeah
gotta do what you gotta do

mm

really good

six
we did
i am bit disappointed about losing the solar panel but it's okay
mm

i know
true

okay
right so it's just kind of a open mic kind of thing or
'kay

yeah
are we considering these points here okay

no

yeah it's true
mm
definitely
as you write your personal coach
what if you get a response two or three months from now that'd be weird



yeah
that's very natural



yeah
and to prove that we weren't wasteful we didn't waste a single bit of play doh we used every bit
yeah i guess
my one my one criticism is that we didn't have enough colours to work with we only had four wasn't enough
i know it could have been amazing
hmm
yeah it's f kind of fun it was
i think it was pretty clever 'cause we were never able to get too far off track because
the information came in at the right time and kind of filled in the gaps enough at the same time you had enough room to kind of
just make things up which was kind of fun
yeah


mm
you know
yeah
yeah that was fun i think the most helpful thing out of everything was getting the the powerpoint slides already put together for you 'cause if we didn't have that there's no way we could have got all that done in time
it was really good yeah
it's kinda fun
yeah
little different
yeah
yeah



yeah
you don't
yeah
yeah

wonder why is there anything about the way that we got so much inform what was it that kept us from going to the the board
yeah that's it 'cause the mics are loose and each time you get up it's s a possibility of tripping over something or getting tangled or
yeah that's it
usually i would do a lot more doodling too but i didn't because


new ideas
hmm
i guess we're on the right track
no none
i think they're fine actually
yeah maybe a s a circle would be alright different
are we back into project mood
yeah

yeah
definitely when when i first filled out the questionnaire i was marking it probably higher in terms of how much i had to how much i stressed over it and then by the time i got to the last one i was like you know not very much
yeah
mm hmm
did you really i just got blank ones and
me too
i deleted slides

that was pretty cool it was a high moment of the whole experiment
i think it would fail i think
it'd be a huge disaster especially if it looks like that
i don't we kind of designed it to look little bit like a face
it's a happy face

yeah it's uh
i wanna see a
yeah
hmm
so we have more slides or
mm
hmm
i
it'd be so cool if we get a copy of the recording
really
filler words or
disfluencies

i find myself hitting the send and receive button on the email a lot just out of boredom like c come on gimme something

it is scary
yeah
it's crazy so
should
has it been forty minutes or whatever this has been long enough

is that the only song you have

that's awesome
maybe i have a different one
ready for this
oh man




no it's important to we talked a quite a bit about uh you know the the interchangeable uh faces
and what we've done here is come up with a bit of a natural look here um f we call it fruity
if you will um right um of course that's uh interchangeable and uh
i think it would be desirable for the uh for the regular product in the in the in the in the
first packaging to be something a little bit more subdued but this is kind of something that can be done um and
as you can see on the television there uh we have the uh voice detector device um
on the top there um so that that will work quite well with with regard to finding
this uh contraption
um what other things do we see here well um if you give it a touch it does have actually a bit
of a spongy feel um so i think that will work well with regards to our market
um and uh let's see well
clearly there's gonna be some more colours and what not available um uh do you have
anything else to add to that
it's actually important to note that the television uh you know if there's an earthquake or anything like that that i it actually is edible inside


um it's encased in a new uh type of uh
polymer yeah it's fine
hmm
it's pos a possible new product um but i think that's i
think that sums up the main features of our of the remote um i dunno if you guys have any questions or f whether
that uh whether we need to worry about any uh other marketing areas or anything of that
nature um did we come in under budget
mm hmm
mm
did we talk about the voice recognition uh option
so uh so uh yeah on the back here you all noticed this area here which is actually
the voice recognition uh uh console and uh i think it's nicely
designed into the into the overall look um but basically the voice recognition uh incorporates
um the latest designs that our research team has been able to cufw uh come up with basically uh quite similar to the coffee
maker um design that we were talking about earlier and um i think that uh
has given a proven um ease of use and what not
and uh allows features like the remote actually talking back to the user
um so

well we didn't quite have enough material uh
oh i see right um
right actually this bottom red ring here just unclips and then you put a a new
a new uh a new plate on top of that so i mean there are i we definitely
priced out a spongy even spongier non natural look um materials
which i think worked out fine we also continued on with the ideas that f following uh apple's colour
schemes with the kind of the uh light orange and the green
the voice recognition area actually doubles as uh as the solar cell area yeah


i mean i think that uh if we're talking about it being one of our main selling features being environmental and without the batteries and what not although it does still have a battery so i'm not sure that you know what the sell is on that


i mean you might be able to sway me on the idea that we our main selling point could be already this voice recognition thing i mean that's what sets us apart right
and the reality is you know for me from an ideological stand point i'd like to stick with the uh the
solar cell but i h kind of have to throw myself in the in the business structure model here
and uh you know i think i think that i think that we need to come to a compromise
here and maybe move ahead with the project without the solar cell

savings
no i think that was a good compromise you brought forward sarah
yep


they like that spongy feel
and the paging function works well that's good to hear we worked hard on that one

w we might have uh we might have lost that granola market again that we're
i guess that's true




we didn't use the whiteboard at all
and
um also had i not been intrigued about the pen i don't think i woulda used it at all i didn't write barely anything
uh
yeah



i so i don't n i think there was a lot of room for creativity we could do whatever basically what we wanted until the budget came down on us um
with the natural look



i think the teamwork was good as well






well i think that was i think that was an issue i kept finding with regard to well no but also yeah when
i was reporting about what each of us was doing i was often confused as to what you were doing
um and then i also felt like you know a lot of our discussion would centre around n specifically
what my task was because that was kind of the interface portion which was what the whole project was about uh
but and then in the end i think our jobs kind of melded together a little bit more which was fine
mm hmm
and i think your leadership was quite good
an so is that the first time you've taken on that kind of role


i had to admit as soon as w we started i mean as soon as we got the play doh th you know the whole concept of really trying to stick with reality went out the window
possibly
oh yeah still have 'em
yep

i mean i think had the issue been more serious we probably woulda brainstormed more during our meetings as a team
well i dunno what i woulda shown on that board
i mean it's just like the paper i don't know what i really needed the paper for um because i've got this laptop standard i just used it 'cause it's literally right in front of me


so is this all we need to get through
is it
any new ideas with regard to remote control concepts

what is that our limited ability to think outside the box
why huh i think it was the real
yeah
think it was also realisation of you basically just copy and paste what's given to you into your presentation which uh wasn't so clear to me at the beginning
oh i added like five slides too but i
yeah mine too
no

i added many slides every time yeah
um


even you

actually that looked a lot more like a tongue from previous to uh fr some other design uh modifications
i hope you appreciate the uh incorporation of some tin foil from a uh random kit kat bar that happened to be consumed
so again i reiterate my question of how different we are comp compared to the other groups especially between culture groups and what not
mm
what the uhs and the
mm
that's scary yeah
well just around that eight or or nine people that are
dude i think we've had internet for like eighteen years
in the eighties
right
yeah it was to the like seven universities or something
you guys ready to celebrate
celebrate

there is another one
huh yep

okay
oh i totally
yeah 'cause i moved it
's put it over here then we don't have to worry about it
huh


yeah that's not you
ah
fair enough
mm
right
appropriate okay
mm 'kay
it is an option
ah i see

nice

do we need to worry about um rot factors
oh okay there's preservatives involved we don't need to worry okay
fair enough
no but
it's a couple years off at least
okay
mm
mm
okay
okay
yeah
mm 'kay
right
do we have um other for lack of a better word skins covers in play now or are those ones gonna be developed later once we see how the couple we have g go or
do we know where we stand on that yet
oh i wasn't expecting a prototype i just didn't know if you guys had any in mind yet
okay
just veneer really yeah okay
mm hmm
and the whole thing
okay
right
yeah there's
okay
mm 'kay
okay very cool
okay
okay
yep it's still an option if we need it very cool nice job
mm hmm
mm hmm
m come in at sixteen

yeah
mm k
true
nah
although we don't wanna get rid of the whole environmental i mean obviously the solar cell is a
big piece of the way we're marketing this as like a natural new thing
but honestly if we cut that one piece out we're actually coming in under budget if i've done my math correctly
i mean
which it's yeah that's what setting us into this young market i mean that's where we started from so
i don't know and i mean you know perhaps when the cell technology comes down in price we can bring that back into the game but it looks like at this point that may be out of our league
right
yeah
yeah
i think unfortunately that's our best option
mm
it kind of yeah
mm mm
yeah
unfortunately i think we are
that would be me um cord
no problem
can you reach that would be great thank you
i didn't even do that one on purpose either damn okay um basically i was just evaluating
um from what we know of how our product's working right now with the criteria that we set at the beginning of these are the things we needed to do
these are the things that look like we feel they're important um so i was looking at basic design things does it fulfil its functions
as a remote is the design what we wanted it to do i are technologies up to where we hoped they would be
and does it fulfil the aesthetic qualities that our original market research was looking for um
basic questions like you know does it turn on does it respond to voice recognition and overall
in general it looks like it's coming up to par um the only thing is with with the pull out panel that is
can it take some adjusting because it's a new sort of interface um that looked like it was coming up rough
but then once you get used to it it does make a lot of sense so i think overall we're headed in the right direction
so
yeah it looks like it's going over well so
we're we're good yeah yeah it's i think eventually if we do um branch out with
this product maybe we do have a higher budget options and if it goes over with this model we can look into um wider range
voice recognition like from other rooms of the house and stuff but for now what we've got is working in the range we need it for so
it's all good
that's everything from me
yeah
yeah it is a set back but
okay do you need the cord back

as in within the team or
okay
it is now you're in charge so there you go

whatever
um
i think they're starting blocks yeah
um you know i think in general for a day's worth of work we actually were relatively productive considering the little amount of input we had going in um and the technology has definitely been a help it's really been interesting to try out all this new stuff
no we didn't we could now if that'd make up for it but really and i feel like if you guys had been designing in here perhaps that would have changed but because of room constraints doesn't really matter
yeah i think i was taking notes more often than usual just 'cause i liked the pen yeah
mm i am disappointed i didn't get a note back from my personal coach
yeah but i didn't get a response so we'll see
okay that would be kinda creepy
well what kind of coaching is that really what if i really needed something
i think so
and even then we did get a decent product turned out although it's not everything we wanted it to be
organic really and highly resourceful team mates might i add which is always a plus
mm yeah i'm impressed
nice all four of those little containers
yeah you could have developed multiple skins really had you had more colours
oh well
they were good
yeah
true
do your own though i did feel like th the level of information dropped off severely over the course of the day
i mean maybe it's just me but i didn't actually get any information for the last presentation at all nothing i didn't even get an email like that was it
so yeah i feel like that was slightly lacking but then you know fill in the blanks on your own level of creativity upped whatever
mm hmm
uh huh that wasn't very much
mm
yes
hmm very much so
yeah already having the formatted stuff helped a lot
very much so
hmm
yeah
that's kind of a good thing though you know give the rest of us some structure to work with so hey
hmm
yeah
yeah i except for a couple moments where it just got out of hand and i knew we were all lying through our teeth other than that
i could only imagine

yeah
totally
i think so
though we didn't actually i mean other than minor discussion at meetings there wasn't except for the actual building but
i feel like if this was a team project there actually would have been much more of the collaborative like brainstorming use the board
well and this would have been six months' worth of work not like three hours' worth of meetings
that's true
yeah that is kind of
mine was the mics i didn't feel like getting up and down and dealing with all these wires i was afraid i was gonna break something actually
yeah
yeah
yeah
true but it didn't even occur to me as an option i mean i don't know that i would have but i know that i consciously didn't
true
yeah
yeah
well it looks really professional
i know
i know i felt like i needed to be professional so i didn't like draw all over my paper and stuff okay well not entirely but still i doodled less than i usually do
i guess
um it did it just say in an email that we need to discuss that
that slide was like that
well
uh i think they still do their job
i am thinking outside the little square box though with literally in like form i don't
yeah
it's still gotta be technically car shaped or it won't fit on the road you know
don't know

kind of
oh how long was our meeting supposed to be how much time do we have left
mm
yeah at the beginning it started out and i felt actually like under pressure like the first couple were taking a lot of work
and i was like had like all this brainstorming i was doing and then suddenly i was like well it's just another two minute presentation that you guys don't
really care about anyway so type away you know you know what i mean like we all sort of knew where we were headed with
it so it didn't feel like it mattered anymore
mm hmm
whatever yeah

very much yeah
see i only got blank ones
my slides were all blank they'd have a title maybe and they were just empty
like with those words already on it
no
i wondered why yours always looked so more complicated
i think i added a slide one time
hey with the whole new background being innovative yeah that was class
mm
i wanna know how our product would fare i can't just leave it there i think it would
take extensive marketing okay an apple with a red button on
top even i am sceptical but you know the whole
yeah
i know it is
mm

i i noticed that by accident
well huh an interesting day all in all i would say
i know
i
yeah
'cause it's such a functional item
mm
mm

we got it to be
like cutting corners
kind of though it was really technically an evaluation of the product not the project in general
which i'm not sure is the same thing at the time that just i made more sense but i could see if they were really asking about us
yay
make it sound eloquent
oh i have to done i've i've done transcription before and it's really ridiculous how many words people say like just in the middle of their sentences like that that mean nothing
there's a guy studying it here yeah he's studying ums and ahs or something yeah
that's a good word for it
just add some prefixes sounds classier
i yeah pretty compulsively during meetings like yeah
yeah we are addicts
mm
yeah
i yeah
true
i yeah
but it's not regular i mean my grandparents had it in the eighties and i got it in ninety four but still
uh huh
my um grammy does computer science back in the states and so they had um an e d u  and gov network there's basically the fundamental structures but it wasn't uh household to household yet because it hadn't been
partitioned off and stuff yeah that was him
apparently does that include like champagne or something exciting
i think so
i think that's a closer

i have no idea

so is that a close
okay that's the end of the meeting
thank you gentlemen
i feel like i'm signing off

so um nice to see you again uh so uh
tod uh for this meeting i will take the notes and do the minutes
uh so we will see our three presentations
um we will start with the uh manager expert wi who will talk
about uh user re requirements whats user needs and what it desire
for this devi device
yep oh i don't think so i think you have to come here
i dunno
i think it should stay

should stay in the square here
oh maybe
oh you can put it here oh that's okay it's jus


hmm
thank you
so um
maybe now we can talk about a user interface and uh about the technical function of this device so uh pet peter can you talk say something about that
no
ah sorry i'm sorry sorry


yeah it's still bob morris yeah you should have put yes
click on yes
yeah
so can we use any any frequency we have the right to use any frequency
okay and what happen with uh radio waves when two neighbours have the same have our remote control for example and so do they have the same frequency or
okay a kind of identification okay
so
yeah
so
okay
hmm
okay so maybe you can talk about the function and
open
slide show
it should work so you can
mm
yeah
hmm

yeah
yeah
so what do you think would be the price it would be out of range or it would be maybe feasible
okay
mm
why because it's simpler
yeah
mm
okay it's a a price matter
yeah
mm
okay

hmm
yeah
yeah well i oh
on the other side we want to have something new you know where
we want to
to have something new and so we i think we should still thinking about it but maybe
okay
okay
yeah
okay thank you peter so um
i have to inform you i receive an email from the management bon board today and they have new
requirements for the for the remote control um
first um they say that's uh about something about t teletext uh apparently it becomes from according to them it becomes out of date out dated and uh
because of the internet popularity and everybody has internet at home and
actually it's not useful to have teletext
um
so i think we can avoid the teletext um the second thing is uh
they suggest that that we should uh use the remote control only for t v  not for
d v d  and other devices because it make it it makes it's too complex
and uh because we have not much time for this project we should stay on t v  on the
only specific t v  remote control
the third the third one is uh about the the the image
of the company so um uh we should we should
keep uh the the product should be recognisable uh
uh
it's that mean we should use the colour of our company and maybe put somewhere the s the slogan of the company which is uh we put fashion of in electronics
so when people see the the remote control they should say oh it's from real reaction and he s they should recognise the company
so um
so now we we should take the decision what we are going to what function we will
have on this uh on this remote control so
mm are we going to use l c d  speech recognition
uh
yeah
maybe maybe
yeah but first maybe what is what are the usual function of a standard remote control i mean
what do
yeah
yeah
i think we should stick on very useful functions because we want less button so yeah
so turning channel of course volume setting
yeah
i think it would be a b
yeah on the other side we have more and more channels and if you want to pass through all the channels to get the channel you want it's
maybe maybe we could think of something more betweens like
uh
yeah maybe something like that
uh
maybe oh i don't know
oh
maybe we could have key buttons like uh discovery channe like documentary channel and movies channel and
and inside this this thing you can move maybe switch if you want to see a movie you click on the movie button so you have all the movie channels and after you've you plus plus plus i it just an idea i don't know what you think about that but
yeah probably yeah yeah
okay
anything else
yeah
yeah
what about the settings of the t v  because it's button we don't use very often but
it's we need it anyway so
yeah yeah i don't know if it's possible to to watch something on t v 
yeah
yeah
so what are we doing with the settings because settings if we want to do settings we need buttons for that
and we want less buttons so maybe with the l c d  we can do something with
less buttons but
mm
yeah oh yeah oh the



yeah
yeah
we should hide them somewhere in the menus of the l c d  or in the back of the remote control or something like that
it's it's a kind of setting i think it should fit in those settings functions because it's not a very current useful function
no i think it's after after five minutes or something a timer i i think no

oh okay yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah so s yeah
yeah
on the back or
for what
ah oh yeah yeah yeah a button yeah i guess so


so any other suggestions or functions
yeah we have still one or two minutes to talk yeah
usually it's already on t v  or something like that
yeah
yeah
yeah if we if we add the time we have to have maybe a bigger display or something like that and is it very useful i mean are users wants to have the time on the on the remote
this is the question is it useful
w in my opinion we should have only useful thing and because apparently they want the simpler it's is better


no time on
i think
yeah
so maybe we think we can think more about that and discuss that maybe last time next time
and uh yeah now the meeting room is busy somebody booked the meeting room just for at one
p m  and so we should leave
uh
so um so now we are going for for a small lunch it's uh
funded by the company and uh after we have uh thirteen minutes
to to do indevel individual works and uh i will do the minutes
and uh
you are going to work on your individual works and uh you will receive as usual your specific instruction and so on thank you everybody
yeah that's it



well okay yeah yeah but the user user interface is responsible
okay so
you're scaring me with l c d  man and speech recognition in remote unit it will be very e expensive

yeah
yeah
at least we have couple of months t to work on it so so it will be cheaper finally

because you cancelled it
yeah
yep
you still want me the presentation
yeah it should be okay
yeah f uh i know about this since it's my it's exactly my field so it's uh kind
of handshaking uh when starting to uh when you start to communicate with the your t v  then then it's
like an handshaking protocol with your your remote so so if two two devices
are trying to go to communicate with the t v  set then the the the one which has
the more energy in the wave is chosen well it can be a problem sometimes
but most of the time it works okay

yeah but we we don't have to think uh about this because i think as a function designer that we will
use the already made uh circuits which we probably bu buy it's worth
to buy and they have these problems solved so so we don't have to think about these
yes i have only a couple of things because i had i struggled a bit with the software that i'm supposed to use in this uh
uh
in this company i was used to use linux before so but i tried to
tried to break through this too i guess
mm ah
okay
how to make it big
slide show okay thanks
okay oh so i will speak about working design that's the first
slide uh what uh i have to do a look at what the other company okay
so uh presently i am looking what is possible to use what circuits
to use and stuff like that because uh i didn't work uh with these uh circuits so far
so i have to look what what is a v a v available on the market for for the communication
for the i r  circuits and so on so i'm currently looking what is available on the web
and uh i wanted to ask you m maybe afterwards after after our discussion if we
have some contacts in some companies so which can report on what is going on there so
i would be glad if you can tell me about them so you know
uh okay findings that's the point that i'm working on currently but uh so
far i i was uh looking what what are the blue circuit i mean radio
wave radio frequency circuits are available now but the prices i read are
high so i know that uh the user interface people and these
speak about radio frequency waves because you can you can uh you
can make the t v  do what you want even if you are in the bathroom or so on but
you know when you are not close to the t v  you probably won't need to to change the program and so on
and so i am i am voting for s to stick to the um infra red control
instead of r w  but we will discuss it later maybe
uh components to use i'm not exactly sure what i will use for the design of the circuit
it depends uh on whether we will use the l c d  and
mainly the speech recognition because the speech rec yeah
no no no no no this we this we buy i think because it's rather cheap nowadays and it's not worth to construct ourselves
exactly
but i'm not sure about the circuit which is responsible for speech recognition this i prefer that we should make ourselves
but it depends whether we take a decision to use it same thing it's fairly
expensive to use these circuits so speech recognition well l c d  it's okay because it's common nowadays
to use l c d  so i agree on using any kind of l c d  less buttons good for me as a as a
designer of the circuit but the speech recognition we have to compare whether the price
and the what does it offer you know
yeah i'm
oh i was not thinking too much about the price but if
we use the l c d  uh even the radio frequency communication with the t v 
set and the backlight and uh related things like the photo diodes and stuff
it should be okay if we decide to use the speech recognition then we probably
could struggle but we'll see afterwards it depends of you if if the
m e  or u i d  i'm sorry about the names i don't really know uh want to
have it like in metal or in plastic these things it it depends on you not because the the
the electronic device's price is not not so big in comparison to to the overall
shape and stuff like that so we will discuss it afterwards
oh this is nothing this is just my notes on what to use and
uh my personal preference is yes i would like also preferably to use r w 
circuit but from the point of view uh of the design and price i would stick to i r s
that's my opinion uh i mean if infra red uh circuit not not the radio frequency
because because the the range where you can use it is fair it's okay i think and the price is fairly cheap for this well depends
jus just the price otherwise i don't care what i put there because it's the chip which i buy or which we buy
so i i i think it's o y o well three to three to five n not ten times but it depends what what we

yeah th they are used to use it when they can see the t v  so i don't know
you the user interface and management man uh
uh okay that's it for me
'kay
i agree
okay so the available things are l c d  the buttons and everything uh radio frequency depends and well the recognition it depends on you guys you should probably speak
okay
uh just one note to the chan channel changing do we will we use only two buttons or or like numbered buttons i mean those nine plus one or two
because it's many buttons and we were speaking about lowering the number
okay so so we keep all these all these buttons
like ten plus five plus one plus one minus or something
or using the names and the keyboard i dunno
you mean like hierarchical structure
okay so s oh sorry
so it requires the use of l c d  probably to to tell you
okay so i'll make a note on l c d 
yeah like roller for the yeah okay
so we are still s speaking about the common devices or we are inviting the new one
on the screen you mean not on the control but on the screen
well this would avoid l c d  then
oh
w i i think it it would be better to to stick to the remote control and not to bother the t v  to to to print these things well it wi it will be still more expensive but for the l c d  and this stuff is no problem in the price
two t v s
like ma
we we could have for example two buttons like simple mode and advanced mode or i dunno or like children and grandfather's mode and the well the the user
not the user the man mana t v  manager mode ah i dunno
uh
yeah
hide them okay
um
yes this i was thinking do we need a power button at all should should shouldn't we do it like sleep mode after five minutes of not using it because generally
yes
well i i uh


you don't need to every five minutes to keep it alive uh probably okay so we should keep this button
okay so we we could p what we could probably do is to keep also to keep uh keep the l c d 
and all the buttons and stuff we could make it like a opening opening style that if
you open it you are you just turn on the t v  and if you close it it will
turn off the t v  if if you like this
because well it's maybe question for you t

yeah i mean like the
yeah but since we have the l c d  we didn't need too much button too many buttons
um okay just um the decision of the power button should we make it a button or some some something which would be
uh power button
if it if it's a button or okay
okay one nice big button old fashioned button to satisfy the grandmothers
hmm
mm
do we still have the time i i just wonder
okay
oh well what w what was the question
yeah but since we want to control all the televisions
and and it would probably be worth to to set the timing on the remote no
because if if the t v  turns on itself it well you know if the time the timer should be there
ah yeah
did you did you ever use the like the timing of turning on the t v  well and based on your

yeah but it can be on the display in in a corner all the time on the remote

yes yes
yeah but we we should be careful about the battery life then if we use the speech recognition
yeah
okay
b you think uh i i'm user interface manager okay okay if i could go there with this cable


sh okay
where's delete button okay
oh i'm sorry

okay
oh presentation three
oh
okay so here is my presentation about technical function design i will talk about different
components and s of system and how they react together okay uh
first what is a remote control simply it's a device as you know for uh for sending
some commands by some waves to uh another device to to tell different
commands uh with this device and the main idea we don't use any cable and we can
rec react simpler with the device uh i it has different blocks
different blocks uh first is remote control have sh ha should have some electric
circuits uh making interface with uh keyboard and uh r reading uh keyboard and
reading the keyboard uh commands
and then inter then make uh these keyboard commands uh in interpret these int
uh keyboard commands and then there should be uh an electronic circuit making uh
electronic signals according to these commands and uh finally there is a transmitter which
is a cord or a a diode making uh making uh waves
to transmit through the air and uh uh this air this uh wave uh will be received by
the by the other device like a television or whatever to uh r to realise the command
okay uh about what i found about uh different uh these different
blocks are uh usually there are two different methods uh to for designing a remote control
they are based on infra red uh waves or uh uh radio waves there
are two different uh uh solutions i mean this is uh this can be uh uh the
the differences the th between different kind of waves infra red or radio waves
and uh also as uh i understood and uh i think it was a part of uh bob
uh uh presentation people prefer to have uh to have
uh the remote control with less button so for the electronic part working and interfacing
with button we should we should try to t try to design a remote control having
uh some some simpler buttons or some rolling buttons to just to
just to search between different options and showing o something on t v  and putting less lesser
stuff on the uh on the remote control
and uh personal preferences uh uh uh uh certainly a remote control
with uh working with radio waves is uh preferred because uh you can pr you
can take it in any direction and you don't need to tune it any way and uh
uh again using bigger buttons and less number of buttons are also preferred
as i see okay that was my presentation
uh huh
uh i don't think so because uh we can make uh we ca we can make this wave in a specific
frequency so they can be in a range which is not inter interfering with the
with other devices inside the home
uh no but as i know there is a range for uh for this uh f for for
uh for this stuff for designing this circuit we can we can we can tune
our uh transmitter to work in this range and for this range we don't need to ask any permission
uh for this i'm not uh i i don't know the solution but one solution can be
something like putting uh p password or something inside the wave so the
only your t v  can understand it yeah identification code inside the
the password may simply uh or uh i identification code may simply solve this problem a specific uh remote control has a specific f
mm
mm hmm

five
mm hmm

mm
mm
mm yes
yeah
mm hmm
mm
yeah
yeah yeah at least nine ten button
or
or something
mm hmm
okay like categorising channels
mm hmm
okay
mm hmm
okay

so uh we don't have any uh we don't have uh we should just design the remote control and we sh
we don't have any access to the to the t v  design or we can change some design because
one solution for this um uh uh ch changing channels is to see a summary
of all channels some some preview of all channels and then you can yeah yeah
b not on the control on the screen on the t v  screen and then
mm hmm
mm hmm

mm hmm
yeah

mm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm
settings


yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah they can yeah they can be hide somewhere by a cover or something like this like covering cu yeah like mobile phone covering

a button is better
yeah
mm


clock or
yes
mm
mm
yes


mm
and uh do we need to include anything about the speech recognition and the speech commands or
i i thin i think it will not take lots of place we just need a microphone and the software
so and it sh and it will be a little bit new and interesting so people may
be attracted to buy this stuff and it's not very difficult to uh put a software
inside the the electronic device and put a microphone it doesn't take that much place and also that much
it doesn't cost that much
mm hmm
thanks
okay can i have the laptop over here or okay have to get up
excuse me okay
okay
okay so basically i'm gonna present some findings of a study we conducted uh into
uh what users want in this remote control um so first of all we
what we did is we um conducted a an experiment with a hundred test subjects
um we put them in a in our um usability laboratory and got them to you know
um play with remote controls and also to complete after they'd done that to complete a questionnaire uh
to tell us what they like and what they don't like in remote controls
so basically um the major things we found out was that um
basically users don't like the look and feel of of most remote controls that are currently on the market um
they you know seventy five percent of the people we we uh did the experiments on found that rem
remote the remote controls that they'd used in the past were ugly completely ugly um they they didn't
match the operating behaviour of the user that is you know the the way users use remote
controls when they're watching t v  um that the layout of the remote controls didn't match they way
that they used it um and
thirdly they say that w half of the users that we um tested said that they only used
ten percent of the buttons that uh are on remote controls um
so we collect we also some collected some usage statistics uh based on how these test subjects
were using their remote control and from this we basically came up with the figure that
the channel buttons the channel selection buttons are the most by far the most used
buttons on the remote control um and you can see they're used a hundred and sixty eight times per hour on average
um while the user's watching t v  um the closest button that was used
well the cl the button that was used that was closest to the channel button was the teletext button um which was used
fourteen times per hour followed by the volume button which was four times per hour um
all the other all the other um buttons such as ch um audio and picture selection um
configuration buttons and things were used you know l approx well less than or equal to one times
per hour um we also asked users um which buttons had the most importance to
them you know which which buttons they felt were the most important buttons on on the remote control
and basically they came they said the channel volume and power buttons had the highest relevance to users
um note that only power was very infrequently used it only had a b a a fr usage
frequency of about one times per hour but users ranked it as having a very very high relevance um
and the audio and picture settings had a very that well the users thought that um w the audio
and picture settings were very uh weren't very important to them um and they used them very infrequently a as well
so we asked users what what um frustrates them the most about um current remote controls and
fifty percent of the users said that uh what frustrates them is losing the remote control
um somewhere in the room and not being able to find it um they also said that it um
it takes a lot of time to learn a new remote control especially when there's many buttons and it's a you know a c a
a unintuitive interface um and then thirdly they some users commented
on the fact that the the you know the way that you have to hold and press buttons on a remote control
ar are bad and um cause u repetitive strain injury
we also asked some users about some specific features that they'd like to see in the on the remote control in particular do they want
an l c d  d display and secondly do they think speech recognition uh is a useful feature to have on
a remote control um basically our findings are that um amongst a younger age
groups uh the answer is umv overwhelmingly yes they want these features they want these high technology features
um for instance ninety one percent of pe of people aged between fifteen and twenty five said yes they
want these features
whereas um the the trend was as users as users um became older and older
uh they were less likely to want these sort of features in a um in a remote control so
i guess it depends on where we're focusing our our market um and as our company
motto is putting fashion in electronics um i think we're focusing on the younger younger
um target demographic and so maybe we should think about adding these sort of high technology features into
our remote control that's my dic that's my presentation thank you

yeah it's true but you know they're features that users want so it's
and our production cost of twelve fifty euros per per unit is fairly high i think so i think we can afford to
to add these sort of features into our remote
it is true
that's the wrong one i think
okay
i have a question
do you think radio waves um will interfere with other appliances in the home
okay
okay
okay
mm hmm
are we um are we planning to take an off the shelf an o e m  component for the radio wave circuit or are we planning to construct our own circuit board
okay s
so we just buy a circuit board and okay
okay
okay
what how much more expensive are we talking three times more expensive or ten times more expensive or
okay
yeah yeah that's still a lot i think it's it's probably not worth spending the extra money
because i mean all the other remote controls on the market have infra red so people don't expect anything
other than infra red so it's not worth spending the extra money
yeah
yeah
but i think based on my usability studies i th i feel that users are prioritise the look
and the feel and the trendiness above you know the difference between
infra red or radio waves so i think we're better off spending money in the usability
phase
okay
mm
well should we start with just the core the basic functions that we need
and then we can move on to the more advanced features
okay well i mean the obvious one is changing channels
yeah
yeah okay

yeah i
ah yeah
to have some feedback yeah
we could maybe also c um incorporate petre's idea of the um slider for the volume with the channel so we c you could quickly just through many channels for the channels perhaps
so we've got channel and volume um
i think so i think basically the core functions we want and then more advanced ones
yeah
i don't
oh i don't but i don't think we're we're the ones i mean this remote control we're developing is a generic control for all t v s i think
okay
but then you don't want to make the l c d  display too complicated at the same time

i mean there's always we can always have these l less often used functions hidden somewhere under a cover or at the back of under a slide or some
yeah yeah
okay
so we have five minutes left um
so i think s the settings we th we are agreeing are agreed that they're required it's just how to a
yeah
okay
yeah
uh okay what else
i mean a power button's obviously
uh required
uh well i think when they say power button they mean to turn the t v  on and off
but if you're watching t v  for two hours you don't want your t v  to turn off after five five minute

i mean based on our usability studies again um pe um people said that the power button was v a very relevant button um you know it was nine out of ten
re relevance

okay
b okay
i think we need to concentrate on the you know the major usage of the th of the control which is you sit
down you turn on your t v  you change channels you change the volume you turn the t v  off
um and all the other f functionality is
not used very often
yeah
i think a button
i think it should be a bu
its own button on the front


okay
s
what about things like the clock and um timers
uh um you know some func some features on the control to display a time or t to display
probably not it's a questi yeah it's a trade off
'kay
okay simple
very yeah okay very occasionally but i do use the i do use the display of the time quite often but
yeah
yeah that's okay that's true okay so no time button okay
okay cool okay
thank you
good morning again
all set good okay
let's see what we can find here
okay a very warm welcome again to everyone um here
we are already at our uh functional design meeting um and this is what we are going to do the
opening which we are doing now um and the special note i'm project manager but on the meetings i'm also the
secretary which means i will make uh minutes as i did of the previous meeting and uh i also
put these as fast as possible in the uh project folder so you can see them and review what we have discussed
um if i'm right there are three presentations i guess each one of you has prepared one good and
um we will also take a look at new project requirements um if you haven't heard about them yet and then of course
we have to take a decision on the remote control functions and we have some more time forty minutes but i think
we will need it um well i don't know who wants to go first
with his presentation
you can go first okay
is there an order i haven't
and one question uh your name denni is it with a
i e  e i e  okay thank you
sorry
yeah it's a little bug it's in the in the smart board
okay thank you
yep
please
okay thank you

okay thank you
um well thank you all huh i dunno uh did everyone receive an email with uh the new project requirements no well
then i think it's a good thing that i made a separate slide of them so you can
all read them oh well not in this presentation hmm
should be in there well i can tell you them uh from my laptop um teletext does
has become outdated since the popularity of the internet so that's uh the first thing we i think
we should pay less attention to uh teletext uh the remote control should only be used for the television
otherwise the project becomes more complex which endangers the time to market and of course would make it more costly i think
um our current customers are within the age group of forty plus and new product should reach a new market with customers that
are younger than forty and you talked about that before and uh a last point but also very important
our corporate image should stay recognisable in our products which means that our uh corporate colour and slogan
must be implemented in the new design so we have to keep that in mind um
well uh according to our agenda it's then time to take a decision on the remote control functions
so who has any idea about what should be on it and what shouldn't
yeah only be used for television
well it says only for television here huh
makes it a lot easier huh
mm hmm
uh well new product should reach a market with customers that are younger than forty and now we have current customers uh of forty plus
mm hmm
so we're going for an l c d  screen
and hoping that when we produce a lot it won't be too expensive
mm hmm
okay so l c d  it is
okay
and what else

yeah okay but for now it's l c d  okay
yeah
yeah and maybe you can make something fancy out of an l c d  remote because it's new as far as i know
okay what else does our remote need
mute button
mm hmm yeah and we could make an a a separate menu on the l c d  uh screen for teletext
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah and maybe a low battery indicator on the screen

so we are going for the for the recharger
okay
yeah also
okay well i've
yeah you have some more
points

and you said something about speech recognition
even bigger than for l c d 
but when you look at the percentages
speech recognition scores even higher huh
yeah well maybe because of the cost but uh nobody knows uh how much uh it will cost uh
but would it be useful to imple implement both
on one remote or
yeah i dunno
so no speech recognition or
yeah and then we have different languages
okay just make a separate remote for each uh
okay so we only do this when we have enough money left okay well i've written down
an an on or off button volume selection channel selection uh the digits from one to
zero huh um or from zero to nine uh a digits button to
switch uh between one and two digits mute button a separate menu for teletext
a battery indicator um we're going to use a docking station and uh probably
l c d  and if there's enough money speech recognition and uh the possibility to uh enlarge
buttons or to have large buttons
in general
okay so not too much teletext support but in a separate menu and
okay but no more buttons or functions or
aren't we forgetting something very important
ping
yeah
and a see through uh
okay well that's the
signal for las final five minutes um so i have uh the things i just read um then we have uh separate menus for teletext screen settings audio settings and what else
channel settings
okay
no we said teletext also a separate menu
okay but we can work that out later i guess so we're having a a general menu with the most used functions
uh teletext screen settings audio settings channel settings and maybe there are options for the remote itself
like uh large icons or small icons and
i don't know what else but
yeah but on the l c d  huh
right yeah okay
but we don't need a special we don't need a special options menu for the remote itself
okay
well maybe there should be a separate button apart from the l c d  because you can't turn it on when the l c d  is off so how do you turn the thing on there has to be a on button on the remote huh
tap the thing okay and then the television is on also or just the remote sure
okay well
yeah so actually we're going to create a a button less uh remote no buttons at all okay well that's might be a unique selling point huh for a remote okay well i guess we have to
postpone further discussion to uh our next meeting because we're running out of time um for now we're having a lunch break
and then there will be uh half an hour for the uh next share of individual work i
will uh write uh minutes if i can create them out of this and uh put them in the the
project documents uh folder and here are the individual actions for the for the other roles
and of course specific instructions will be sent to you again by your uh personal coach
luckily as we are okay well thank you very much for now and uh have a nice lunch huh
yeah choose a number

yes
well
well everybody already has his presentation so you can adjust it


yeah


oh right

there is something turning



yeah i've got it there too

yeah

shall i go uh next
'kay
so
well uh my name's and i looked at uh technical functions design of the remote uh i did this by uh looking at examples of other remote controls of how they uh they look and information from the web that i found
um well what i found was that uh th the actual use of the remote control is to send messages to
television set how you uh d what you described uh just early and this can be all sorts of medsa messages
turn it on turn it off uh change the channel adjust volume that kind of thing uh play video teletext
but also t uh play c d  if you use it your c d  player the
remote control will that one there are some uh examples of remote controls you can see they are very different
the one has got all the functions that you could possibly need and an lot of uh buttons etcetera and
the other is uh more user friendly little with big buttons and uh not n all
the the the the stuff you can do with it but uh the the essential stuff is there
um i guess you could better y you should look at a a
user centred uh approach because the customers have to use them and and if they don't think it's usable
they won't uh buy it a lot of buttons they may think from i don't need s as much as that
uh well perf personal preferences is is uh a simple remote with uh the basic functions that
you can need that you could use but uh keep in mind the new functions of t v  what we discussed earlier split
screen and uh is that a function that you should have because all the t v s will have them or because of only
a few and isn't really necessary and then uh make it i would make so that you can could
uh use it on more than one appliance if you have one that uh uh does with
the vi the the video it could also work with uh with the stereo because play is play and
stop stop and that sort of thing the shu c you could reuse the buttons so that you don't have to have a lot of buttons for uh
anything and it should be a user friendly clear buttons and not too much
and that is my presentation
you must still have it open
yeah
hmm

mm


oh right


no
res i did not perhaps the rest

oh
mm
well you said it should only uh work with one appliance or with one uh d che only the t v 
and the video also or not uh
oh alright okay
yeah
then it should have uh on off and uh
yeah and per perhaps uh
no well uh uh yes yes s sh a button where you can uh change from one number to two numbers can you don't know if that's got a name but
yeah s
yeah
yeah
yeah so you should have that one on
mute misschien also
an

but do you
but if you would do an l c d  screen do we have don don't you have any buttons or because if it only directs at the t v  then you only have uh i don't know what you want to do with the l c d  screen
yeah
oh right so you can
oh yeah alright so you can adjust which buttons you want on that s screen
yeah alright oh right
yeah
yeah would be yeah

well we had twelve fifty i guess for uh production yeah i dunno how expensive an l c d  screen is
any guesses
yeah but
but he also said that we should not only focus on the younger people but also on the older and will they use it if it only has an l c d  screen
oh so still a little bit people
yeah that's right but you don't want to alienate the other uh
but if they also buy it then it's alright
i guess
yeah
alright
an yes
yeah
yeah
but perhaps later so uh
yeah
i don't
well perhaps we should have a backup plan that we would use buttons if it's uh too expensive
yeah
the l c d  oh that's a bit of a problem
oh that's a bit of a problem
yeah but they don't they don't like it they think it's ugly when it has an l c d  screen
oh alright i thought that you said that
yeah

yeah
a mute button
i think and
yeah
but
but shouldn't you put a button of for teletext on the for the people who want to use it
remembering we have got a big remote that you have to fill
yeah
yeah they are less important but i think they should be there or not
like with a with a mouse you have not yeah
we should think of the twelve fifty we have but
i don't know how much that's going to uh
yeah
you should perhaps you should be able to to switch the control off if you have an l c d  screen that's burns all the time i dunno
you shouldn't on and off because that's ver extra that you have t first you have to turn the remote on and then you can uh i don't know
nee that's that's uh yeah
but then you can't
yeah
yeah yeah au automac matically that it yeah
yeah

if it's sensible
yeah
yeah b when the batteries are low
but you'll also forget to put it in because you throw it on the couch and you don't remember
yeah that's right
yeah
well i think the batteries should should w should work a lot longer than a couple of days or not 'cause
yeah that's right but
yeah
right
but then you also have to s have somewhere where you can put a remo recharger near your couch because otherwise you have to walk a long way when you twoft want to turn on the t v 
yeah i think everything has it for and i guess
yeah
alright

yeah twelve fifty twelve fifty
so it's pretty big
yeah w i know let's do a speech
yeah yeah
you can clap or something
yeah
now you shouldn't say the wrong thing i dunno
but they want to talk into the remo remote control or something or
oh but do we want to implement that or

yeah
i know
mm
well
i don't know if that can be done with the cost of twelve fifty with that uh
yeah but how would you like to implement that that you say volume up and then it goes up or
uh
then you also have to have different languages if we go international then uh it's y it's yours to do a french and dutch and english and
yeah that's right
yeah
yeah you can use icons for the
a speaker and uh
but if that's better than language for the for the remote
then it's yeah
well if it could be done we
yeah
yeah that should be uh anything matters
well you sh you should to adjust the thing
yeah
and you have to speak the so that it can understand
you could use that n as an option if you have money left or something
yeah let's do speech
yeah
mm
yeah i with uh teletext if it wasn't ver very important it was but you also now have colours i don't know if we should implement that yeah when you press the red button you go to page one hundred two and when you press the
i don't know if we should implement that because it says that teletext not really important but yeah the shortcut and you can't go to sport
yeah
'cause it should be there
so actually it is there but it's just not r ready there
you'll have to search for it

yeah
yeah that's a
i guess not
we've got anon
have got got two examples here but i don't think there's anything we're missing
well we don't have the video orders
yeah you could look here all the the
uh th th th th i don't know technical functions they're a bit small you can we should stretch them because
i guess we've got them all
and for a t v  can you zoom in a t v 
or that you can put 'em on uh on on wide and yeah but that should also be a sub then a sub uh menu thing
yeah so we should also implement se screen settings
oh right
yeah
yeah so you can program the
yeah so the first you see the main and the other ones you can uh go to uh
yeah
i hope we can do this
we don't have to use that top yeah
yeah
and do we want them in different colours or
and and the buttons should they have colours
oh but we don't have any buttons
yeah
they think it's ugly right
perhaps you can uh make adjustable fronts like with the telephones you can uh but i don't think that uh
yeah

yeah
yeah
a disco version
five minutes
oh yeah right so you can program the t v 
perhaps you should you'd throw them on on in one pile so options and then you sub them otherwise you have all those teletext perhaps teletext not but
yeah but i
yeah
yeah but
i don't know
or do we have any buttons on the remote
which one
but that's also in the l c d  right
so we don't have any normal buttons that uh no alright
yet on and off is p is perhaps you kno
no no
oh well you should be able to set which t v  you have
if you have if you have uh
yeah
but isn't idea to use uh uh what you said uh normal on and off button for the t v  that you don't have to use a
yeah but but not for the remote but for the t v  that you use
but a not as normal button in the l c d  yeah
no you just tap i think
but
yeah a yeah i don't know whether it's handy to have a n a normal on button a r just uh rubber uh for for t v  so you can turn it on and then you can choose the channel otherwise you i don't know whether or not that's
yeah yeah to turn it on
of or you should put it in the l c d  screen
yeah i have yeah
well i i guess if you use the l c d  screen you first have to search where is the on button then you uh you you then turn it and then the t v  goes on but if you have a normal on button on the on the remote then you do the on and then you search the channel which you want
oh right
yeah i think so too otherwise y wet e k yeah
yeah
if we can afford it

alright

lunch

should we put this back in our rooms or uh
yeah
one question
send submit
mm yeah

i'll go first okay i'll go first yeah
so huh
okay um
okay um i wanted to explain the working design of the remote control it's possibly very handy if you want to uh design one of those um
well so it basically works uh as i uh uh r wrote down uh in this
uh little uh summary uh when you press a button uh that's when you do pr for example when
you uh want to turn up the volume um a little connection is made uh the the rubber uh
button just presses on a
on a little print plate uh which uh makes uh uh a connection that uh
gives the chips uh which is uh mounted beneath those uh that plastic of a rubber button uh senses that a
connection has been made and know and knows what button you pressed becau uh for example the the volume up or volume down
button um uh the the chip uh makes a morse code
uh like uh signal which uh then is si uh signalled
to uh several transistors which makes uh which sends the signal to a
little let you know what a let is okay and that makes uh the the infra red
lights signal which is sent to the television set uh which has a sensor
in it to uh sense uh the signal of the infra red
that's basically uh how it works
um the findings uh uh that i found uh searching up some uh
detailed information about the remote controls are that uh they are very easy to produce uh it is pis
uh it's possible to uh make them in mass production because it is as eas it is as easy as uh
printing a page uh just uh fibreglass plate um is b uh is
uh covered with uh some uh coatings and uh uh
and chips uh and the technology's already available we don't have to find out how remote controls uh have to work or uh how that how uh to make some chips that are possible to uh to to transmit those uh signals
uh i made a little uh
uh
animation of about how a tran our uh remote controller works
we tel
there
okay uh well the sub component i suppose that you understand what a sub component is is f in this example it's the
button uh when it is pressed down um the switch is ter is uh is switched on
so with uh the wire is sent to the to the chip in uh co operation with the battery of course
because to make uh a a signal possible you have to have some sort of uh
li uh a d ad uh electronic uh
yes uh okay um w after it's being composed by the chip uh the signal
uh is transported uh to the infra red bulb and from there it signals a morse code like
signal to the to the b to the bulb in uh in the television set
okay s uh i wrote down some personal preferences about uh the remote control of course it is very handy if
the remote control is hand held so you don't have to uh uh wind it up or something or just
is it's it's very light to uh to make uh to use it uh i
personally uh pref prefer that uh it would be p uh come available in the various colours
and uh easy to use buttons but i suppose that the one of the other team members uh uh thought of
that uh too and it is possible for several designs and um
easy to use b uh sorry easy to use buttons perhaps soft touch uh touch screen uh buttons because uh the rubber buttons are always
uh uh they uh slightly uh they can be slightly damaged uh so the numbers on the buttons are
not possible uh to read anymore and uh well as i said uh before th uh we can uh make several designs
okay well that's my contribution to this meeting and uh
two of these this meeting so
okay


hmm

mm
mm
uh l c d  screen as in uh touch screen
okay
'kay

okay
no
yeah
mm
yeah for
standby options yeah
uh yeah
two s two two digits oh okay
yeah i understand what you mean yeah
it makes it twelve yeah
indeed okay
well not really and and there are some models that don't uh accommodate that function
so d uh wh the philip's television makes it possible in that indeed to uh press one and then two to make uh the uh tj
to reach channel twelve but uh all the television makes uh use of those button where you first
press that button and then press two digits to uh to get
uh yeah think so
mm
mm hmm
yeah we we could yeah but i think that uh that collides with our mission to make it very cheap because l c d  screens are very expensive a touch screen uh probably uh even more
so true true but uh
well um is it possible to make an l c d  screen uh how was the information
so perhaps we should we should focus on that l c d  screen
yeah but uh will we not uh
exceed our uh our uh production uh
is it possible to find out anyway you know
no an l c d  screen's just like uh like a drawn here um just uh displays several buttons
for example um if you wanted the minimal uh use b uh buttons such as channel and volume
you just h uh displays four buttons on the screen and it's possible to p uh press them down just like a touch screen
yeah we can make it possible to do that yeah
yeah yeah
yeah yeah
that's my uh
yeah
twelve fifty
um

well i suppose wi if the mar if our um
if the i if the young people are interested in l c d  screens we should make 'em and if that is our d uh market share to uh and our goal to uh deliver those uh remote controls
yeah
yeah
mm it's treasure i hope we uh h and let's hope to reach those uh those sales
yeah can you um uh s i think that that they will send you some information about uh the cost of l c d  uh screens
uh so if you uh yeah so if you uh you receive an email about that uh can you post it in the or shouldn't we post that in uh our projects mail uh folder
because you are the the marketing uh expert
i uh
yeah sure sure

mm
it's looks fancy one yeah of l c d  screen
mm yeah
and then not yeah
um
yeah
mm okay
yeah
yeah
and there's also a
a sh but in a sub sub menu or something like that uh i think it's also important to uh make it possible to um how do you call it in english uh
to not use batteries and use ac uh bat uh batteries to uh to be yeah yeah sure indeed so uh you can mount uh the the the uh
uh the remote control to um
to refill the
yeah okay because i uh when you get an l c d  screen you run it on batteries the batteries will be uh empty very soon very fast
yeah
yeah yeah yeah
uh
and go to standby mode when you don't use it so that
yeah automatically after two minutes or three minutes something like that
yeah sure

yeah
mm
yeah
no when you when you're done with s uh w uh watching your television you have to put it
yeah sure of course
yeah but
but you also forget to buy batteries and then you can you can't use it so i
yeah
high power user cell i
uh it should be uh a standard move to to put your remote control in the charger when you're done watching
television that's also a a a great advantage because you can't lose it anymore because you are
obliged to uh put it in the charger and not to uh leave it in a couch uh between some cushions
okay
yeah it hasn't it doesn't have to be big
yeah just just a cable or a even a a a a a charger where you can mount it on something like that just u
okay
functional designs uh for the elderly uh you could make it possible to enlarge the screen so make it possible to not uh display uh a button at ten points uh or
yeah but it is uh one of the functions you have to uh specify
because we can look at uh uh perhaps uh forty buttons at a screen but the elderly only look at two buttons okay
speech recognition hello twelve euro twelve euro fifty
well spread it by a big market

well let's leave out all the remote controls and just put a microphone on top of the television to
yeah yeah
turn volume up
hey that that's an idea
okay well that should it has to be remote control not
yeah
sure why not why not
yeah mm
yeah
perhaps the options should be uh
why not
why not
let's hope uh to have some uh d
we should do it yeah sure
yeah
certain systems already exist i think
true yeah
yeah
this should be uh accommodated with some software uh uh yeah
right
swahili swahili
yeah
indeed
yeah
so we want to uh yeah it's international uh okay
okay
y it should be done if it could be done should be done
that's not so difficult at all because i already use on several voice operated systems and they are all possible to uh not all but
yeah sure indeed

for speech recognition
uh yeah
s shortcuts uh
mm
sh yeah just just sub menu yeah not directly uh available okay
mm
directly available so does it confuse uh the user
uh i'll search um
if you want to use teletext you can push the teletext button and then the options uh become available
no
menu
mm
there are a lot of options depending uh on what kind of television you got 'cause if you don't got a wide screen television you don't need the uh the screen settings uh for uh
yeah and if the television does not support such uh operations
yeah
yeah
colours i think the main colour of the remote control is uh the colour of the l c d  screen i because we don't want a lot a devi yeah a device self s g
okay so use uh very uh lot of peo
adjust with phones yes
okay twelve euro fifty
well make it available in different colours you mean sure
red white blue black
grey yeah sea view yes simpson's versions and
leave
yeah
mm
no
uh not button
yeah sure of course you need uh a settings button uh or a settings option for the remote control
just tap it
yeah it should be in standby mode but
a a a normal button on the remote control or norm
yeah because uh when you touch the l c d  screen when it is in standby mode it should pop on
wh uh why would it be a a need to have a normal button
mm
i think it looks a lot more fancy if you use uh if you don't have any buttons on the s on on remote control
oh okay
oh
mm
okay food
yeah think so
yep yep yep yep
mm hmm
yeah
well shall i go first with the users
i think well okay no problem
ja precies ja precies ja precies
e i e 


animation
infrared light

to this meeting

smoking
'kay
check

kijke

'kay so we're going to j discuss the functional requirements of the remote that m that means that functions user n want to have on the remote control or just
yeah and the users actually the methods i i prefer is we're going to look which section of the users we are going to focus a l on more
are the younger people going to buy the remote control or the elderly people and then tho that section we're going to focus and adjust the remote more to that section than the whole user
section okay some data younger people from sixteen to thir forty five um
years are more interested in fj features like l c d  screens speech recognition e etcetera
and we possess about two third of the market from in that range of age
the elderly people from forty five years to sixty five years are not that much interested in features
and we possess less than two third that's two fifth of the market share in that area
goed so
'kay
findings fifty percent of the users lose their remote often so we don't have to make it very small
like uh like a mobile phone or something but some somewhat bi bigger than small so you don't lose it
that much anymore seventy five percent of the users also find it ugly and
fif seventy five of the users zap a lot so the buttons sh should be that small or shouldn't be that
complex because we have to search for the buttons which one are you going to use
next
important issues about the remote i think it would be better with a personal reference but okay remote control has to have to have a low power usage because s w
seventy five percent of the users only zap one time an hour so the power usage is also one one time an hour or so with a high power usage we would
use a lot of but batteries
the volume button and the channel buttons are the two most important buttons on the remote control so those they those have to h be find very easily and have to be somewhat like bigger
etcetera it has also be have to find easily when the label is gone my colleague also announced it that labels should be scratched off or would be s uh
senden okay so uh if that's k uh if that's the problem you also have to find it easily
on the remote
buttons like what all colleagues said have to have to be minimalized
or should be covered or in l c d  screen l c d  screen is easy because we have the l c d  screen we have the various options put one option and then you have the all the buttons of that options so the other options would be gone and you don't see the buttons so l c d  screens should be easy
but an l c d  screen the problem with the l  sc l c d  screen is that elderly people fr from forty five to for sixty
five years don't use the l c d  screen a lot so we have to that keep that in mind that
if you're going to implement l c d  screen you don't have to make it that hard to learn or to use
yeah touch screen yeah
the last but not least younger people are more critical about the features because they use the remote control
often more often and are more technical than the ol older people and the older people spend more money
and easily on a remote control so we have to keep in mind to to focus not a lot not that
much on the younger pep younger people but also somewhat on the elderly people and
on my personal preferences i don't have any mo more time to come with that but like i said l c d  screen
is easily to use because you have you can implement a lot of buttons in one remote with not that much buttons
and it should be easy to use especially the volume buttons the channel buttes buttons and the number buttons to zap through the channels
and that is it
ja
be television
only the television
so yeah then you can yeah
requirements no functions
yeah the basics then by a volume channel one till two zero numbers on it oh teletext doesn't have to be um other functions yeah i had
yeah yeah
i think it's i think it's easy to implement a button with a s s what which especially do that because some t v s
if you press the t one and then the two it be between five secs it make twelve and that's
that's not relaxed
to user
yeah
so that it easy and fast
yeah
our main targets' age are were forty five plus or
forties okay because because younger people as
uh younger people have now sixteen till to twenty five age are f eighty one percent interested in l c d  screen
from twenty six to thirty five have sixty six percent and thirty six to forty five fifty five percent so i think to um
because on most recog remote controls um the print plate will be broken how much two years you have to press h very hard to go to the next channel with the l c d  screen it's easier because you only have to wipe the screen to uh for fingerprint and then you can use it again
yeah okay
yeah but a you don't know
true

yeah it only says that this perce percentage like l c d  screen
because yeah and it says that younger age between sixteen and forty five highly interesting features more critical and if the only f
yeah because our target is sixteen to forty five
yeah you don't know how much it costs yeah you don't know how much it costs the l c d  screen
no i don't have any costs here i only have percentages
yeah
yeah if you want to adjust like for example adjust the audio settings you press audio on the touchscreen and you get the buttons for audio settings so the other buttons are gone
i think it's the most easier thing yeah
no
yeah


highly
yeah but
um s forty six to forty five thirty three percent and sixty fifty six to sixty five twelve percent but our our our what's it project requirements are the new products should be reached for new markets to customers that are younger than forty
no that not now but so
yeah but market share fro for for forty years and younger is higher than that of sixty five and younger
yeah i i if it yeah if it costs gets too much too expensive then yeah we should be sticking to rubber buttons
n nothing no costs at all
yeah in
i think that should yeah i think we all get the costs of everything
yeah okay i'll i'll post it
yeah
okay l c d  yeah then you have the seventy five percent of users find it r ugly
yeah and eighty percent of the users would spend more money with a when a remote would look fancy
tha i l i it'll look fancy with l c d  screen yeah
yeah just a the plain remotes not not specific l c d  remotes
so
mm hmm
yeah of course
and then you have the other thing that seventy five percent zap a lot but that's not a f question with the l c d  screen only thing you have to do is wipe the screen off once each time to get all the fingerprints off it
um
mm hmm the most important things on a f on an on an uh remote control are channel selection volume con selection
and power s power usage
and a teletext but that is not of the question other things are
sorry
yeah it could be
yeah
yeah teletext
and other other less important things are screen settings audio settings and channel settings but
less important yeah should be there but not press yeah sub menu yeah
yeah in a breath it's
charted
yeah but we don't we don't have any costs now so yeah
yeah e e power supply is one of the most important things
yeah i think it's it's not that easy because i don't think people will like it who who uh that you have to turn it on first and then use it so i think it's better when th the t v  shuts down the remote shuts down
yeah
yeah after two minutes yeah two three minutes yeah
yeah and then b that uh before an hour when its get again gets empty then you have plenty of time to recharge it of put it in a recharger charger
yeah if it's
uh
yeah because when you're watching t v  you're zapping and you have to put it in a recharger and i don't think it
yeah okay but then we have to be sure that the the the the batteries go hours six hours five six hours then
yeah then you have a problem
or we have to be sure that the batteries last couple of days when they're recharged
so
yeah because you have b but you have l c d  screen
high power usage
yes
true
yeah yeah
true
yeah you made a point there
yeah otherwise all your yeah
just a small device plug it in that's it yeah like a like telephone charger or something
yeah
yeah
it has to be easy to use also or things uh market share speaker re speech recognition
i think
also
well i think that this should be standard large button large buttons yeah okay

yeah it says also yeah
twelve that's an also ninety one percent sixteen to twenty five twenty six to thirty five years seventy six percent and thirty six to forty five thirty five percent
but then i i i
yeah
yeah ninety twenty five
channel
yeah
yeah twelve
yeah is this only would you would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control it's the only thing it says
i think an l c d  screen should be suf sufficient
yeah it says a lot but
no i think i think it's better to have l  l c d  screen because in the area of tw thirty six to forty five
we have about thirty percent of the market share in in our hands and fifty five of those people
want l c d  screen and thirty five want speech recognition so i think it's better to keep it with l c d  screen
yeah if the costs al allow it
nee
if it should be done if it could be done i won't matter yeah
yeah
mm hmm
true
yeah true
but that should also be with f should be also with l c d  screen because then i think in chinese is different written volume is different written than um swahili or something
ja well possible
yeah yeah yeah yeah
'kay what else
yeah we have to keep yeah
i think it's difficult
every language of dialects
i think it's very differen difficult
yeah
i think it can't be implemented but maybe
yeah 's an option yes
fifty euro cents
yeah
mm yes
no but
curved
um
i think we should we could that we could also implement a audio settings screen settings and channel settings but as sub menus
d mainly if you turn the uh remote control on you have to u you have to see from one till zero channel and volume and if you want to use teletext screen or audio then you can press it it should be available but not
not yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah but s
yeah
they'd have to be easy to use
the sign of it
uh no what else can you do with a television
uh play pause doesn't n need to be there
yes so this is your presentation
we could check the other remote controls with technical functions
which ones were yours
techni
ja ja ja ja ja technical functions yeah okay
uh i think i go to have volume mute but i yeah
very slow yeah the zoom buttons
yeah b wide screen high screen different things you have yeah different uh yeah
yeah it should be available but then in separate screen settings or something
yeah screen settings audio settings teletext settings you have
channel settings
so those four and of course the main
yeah yeah
like tap screens or something or i dunno
something
yeah if uh
no you don't yu a no you then you don't no ni don't then you don't use it
mm hmm
yeah so you leave it alone yeah or it could be possible to have a a standard version of the remote an expanded version
yeah
colours yeah
yeah then defines itself
because uh how many percent eighty percent
would spend more money if it looks fancy
yeah

rasta colours
yeah see through version yeah
if you press a button it turns green
channel settings
yeah
mm
yeah could be possible
or like uh you have a menu button you press yeah or otherwise you have a menu button press menu then you have uh main uh menu search uh all the all the settings
yeah no problem yep
um i think b because we don't have a lot of buttons on the one screen i think the buttons yeah but but or like you have you only have channel button or volume button those buttons you can you can
yeah yeah th
no no normal buttons yeah maybe only the on and o on and off button but i don't think
mm no
no no no because we we discussed that you could charge it otherwise is it it jumps to stand by mode automatically
yeah but a t v  of course th that's the i think that's a best thing is that to implement that one in the menu with the volume and channel no
yeah you tap touch screen yeah then it's turn turn off turn on
no just the remote a television don't have to be on that one you can press on yeah stand by then press on remote press on and then t v  should be available or not
separate
yeah but i think the re the remote control if you press tap the screen it always should jump to the screen which has the volume button channel button and of course of also the on and off button
yeah
mm hmm
yeah if we can afford it yeah
mm hmm
is everyone ready to start okay great well welcome to
the third meeting of conceptual design i'll just get the powerpoint presentation
up and running
okay um on the agenda for this um for this particular meeting we'll have your three presentations
on what you've done since our last meeting after we came up with um some general ideas of our design
and um then we have to make some key decisions on on our remote control concept
and how we're gonna make it what uh materials we're gonna use and that sort of thing the meeting will be forty minutes long
and um we will once again have poppy as our first presenter
alright and i will switch up powerpoint
okay
um
are they all included like mandatorily or r are these different options
yeah
mm
um
what is a hand powered dynamo
just every every once in a while
just every once in a while or constantly
alright it'd be kind of strange to always be cranking it i think
no
right
right
mm hmm

yeah
mm hmm
um one thing with the scroll buttons though it it we would have to have an l c d  um
display and the glow in the dark thing
might be difficult
yeah
right
yeah
uh
yeah um one concern with the rubber casing is that it would be rubber encapsulating all of these chips and diodes and delicate technology as
like as the exterior this is the one thing that's protecting its innards
yeah another thing is it might be more difficult if it's a rubber exterior talking about putting on interchangeable
plates um is it i don't see how a like a rubber plate going
on top it would stay there like if it was sort of like a clip on plastic plate it would work that way
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
alright so maybe the
yeah
yeah
yeah
that sounds good i um is it possible to put designs onto this type of rubber
okay we'll just say yeah yes just why not alright i like
the kinetic energy source idea um i don't know when people will um
be moving a remote around a lot but i think that it's worth it kinetety kinetic um
energy source it could make an we could have any kind of style it wouldn't be as heavy or bulky and
yeah just for environmental reasons
yeah

yeah
yeah you can watch a t v  in the dark then
yeah
i think that might be a little impractical though
yeah
like people don't wanna have to worry about that
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah or just like pick it up when you're gonna use it
yeah
alright cool
's that the end of your presentation alright thank you
yeah that's um
oh okay yeah
hmm
yeah yeah 'cause i'm sorry um because command interface requires you to type
textual commands and input at a keyboard so the numbers are sort of like a keyboard you're pressing the numbers
for um for what you want
yeah we'll be doing
yeah it'd be more a command interface and then
yeah
hmm
yeah i think they're talking about l c d  type things
yeah
yeah
what do you mean
oh yeah like how the buttons
yeah as a button though so it's a keyboard in the shape of it right okay yeah i like that idea
yeah i'm sure i like kinetic energy would probably dip into the budget
a bit more too yeah
mm hmm
do you think that we should keep all the buttons to one same colour just to keep it give it a simplistic look
yeah yeah
but what about the lighting up effect
um well um i thought we had um decided that we would if you touched one of the buttons they'd all light up and so if they were black it wouldn't be possible for them to light up
if they were white they would glow probably if they were made out of rubber
oh where would the light come from
yeah
yeah and well rubber is a more translucent product too so we have that taken care of
oh
mm
well if they're raised up buttons so that you can feel them we were talking about it being more
um a lot more tangible um it might be more difficult to do if they're
if they're sticking up if it's flat then like o like on a cellphone or a mobile phone
it's like all very flat and you just have to sort of press down on these tiny little buttons but
yeah
yeah
okay alright
if it's do able we can do yeah sounds good to me
alright thank you
that means you're up yeah

mm hmm
yeah yeah it's the fruits and vegetables is the only
area that i find rather jarring everything else we can really we can really
um do according to our plans already given the market but fruits and vegetables seems a very strange idea for a remote control
yeah
yeah
but they still need to um fit into people's decor though
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
tone it down yeah like more like photos of fruit on on our product

mm hmm
yeah um
alright given that information
we need to start making some more specific decisions
so i'll need to um hook up the powerpoint again
but it's still around right okay
okay
i'm just trying to make this pop up now
alright here we go
okay so we have to uh decide now exactly what we are going to do so energy we oh
oh no i can't write it in when it's in this setting
does anyone know how to take it out of
um yeah
yeah okay um so back to decisions energy we've decided on kinetic right okay so that's good
hmm
but would a backup really be necessary
i mean will people just use the battery if there's no if there's
if there is backup
yeah
yeah there's like no reason why it wouldn't work right
yeah it could even be one of our selling points
yeah yeah environmentally conscious or something
yeah
alright the next um decision is chip on print i don't exactly know what that means
right and we were going for more simplistic style right
yeah
i think we decided on the pushbuttons right
yeah would we need a more advanced one for uh the lighting the interior lighting system
yeah
okay that's called medium or regular
'kay
okay and cases um does this is this dependent on shape or what it's made of or what
yeah well i guess plastic and coated in rubber plastic with rubber
coating and interchangeable
um
yeah interchangeable plates okay
user interface concept
this is your time to shine
oh yeah yeah
command interface
did you say command line okay
line interface
alright and supplements
what's that all about

um
mm hmm
um what are our choices here
you mean like we'll have the numbers of the channels and we'll have the channel changer and volume and power
um
yeah like i don't know if we should go into like adjusting light levels things like that because different televisions will have
um yeah
yep
yeah it was hardly ever used really
yeah and most televisions will come with a remote
yeah
'kay well we know we want numbers
yeah it does
yeah and different televisions like we i don't know if we can make a remote that would be universal to all the different kinds of
changes like that
volume
yeah
oh we have five minutes to finish our meeting
crap okay um let's do this fast um
should we have audio
it only comes up on mine usually
yeah i don't i it's it's a problem with the international uh appeal i think um if we have audio because we don't know how other televisions work but we know that everyone has this and it's the same
yeah
yeah
alright
good and okay in closing 'cause we only have five minutes we'll be meeting again in thirty minutes um
you'll be working poppy will be working on the look and feel design
wait a minute is that right
yep and um the user interface design so this is where the trendy stuff comes in and you'll be evaluating the product
um
poppy and tara will have to work together using modelling clay
and um your personal coach will give you the rest of the information of what needs to happen
alright so anyone else have something to say
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
five
mm hmm
yeah
yeah
yeah
lots of yeah
alright
'kay we'll stick to the fruit and veggie theme then alright and um we'll reconvene in thirty minutes
'kay bye i'll see you later
oh what did i just do okay
yeah

okay

okay
thank you
should be just loading
okay oh although i can't see it on my screen
that says go here
okay i've been doing some research into the different components that we could use um what's
available to us f to actually make the remote control um
first of all we have to look at how the remote control is actually made and what is it happens inside the casing which
is more your field um thes main internal feature is a circuit board which contains
all the elec electronics and also the contacts with the power source which is not necessarily a battery
as we're about to see um there are several components of um
the circuit board that we need to consider where we'll be getting them from what they'll be made of um including
the integrated circuit which is also known as the chip which is where all the main information is uh
contained um diodes transistors resonators resistors and capacit capacitors
all need to be considered as well um and all their positioning in the circuit
uh these they're all different options they're all separate apart from the chip which we will probable decide whether
we buy a simple a regular advanced we can go into that later um all the other things are individual components that we'd
have to get in separately and work out the most like effective um circuit including
all the wires and everything like that and the l e d  of course that's a light emitting diode so we could so we've got flex
flexibility with colours and things with that as well
okay there are lots of different possibilities for the energy source we could use a basic battery but that
brings with it like they need to be recharged and the bulk the size of it as well and they're not so
great to dispose of environmentally there's a hand powered dynamo which is
a sort of thing that was used for torches fifty years ago a bit out of date kinetic energy
is something that's been recently developed
um where you manually charge up the power like you wind up something sorry yeah every once in a while i think but it's
yeah it would be like going a step back in time i don't think it would really be with kind of cutting edge technology whereas
kinetic energy is a new idea that's being used by some watches and other devices
where you just shake the device and it gives it power i mean the kinetic
energy is transformed into power to make the circuit work um or there's solar
power which we've been considering inside a building which is where it's gonna be used might not be
quite so useful but good to look into renewable energy always
the way
um lots of considerations for the case like what sort of shape it would be curved or flat that's
got a lot to do with the ergonomics like how it's comfortable and s sits in the hand we don't want something that's huge
and you can't pick up or too small or too slidy i know i've had a remote control
before which you couldn't tell which was the front and the back 'cause it had so many buttons on
and the shape was so symmetrical that i'd be pressing like a volume button instead of the on button
because you can't really see which way round it is
um we also can choose what materials um the we could use metal we could
use rubber which might be more um ideal for the anti r s i 
it's like the same sort of rubber that's used in stress balls and things like that so it's very like soft
not so stressful on your hands wood um again stepping back in time
again there i don't think that's quite up to date with what we're looking for here um titanium is not
gonna be possible even though it just it beyond our budget really but would've been maybe for future projects
um right our choice for buttons as well we've developed some we've got some good advances in technology
with our research team have found some uh new multiple um option
scroll buttons i think that was brought up for um
they're basically quite a flexible design modern you don't have to use individual buttons you can just
slide up and down i'm sure we're all quite familiar with those on mobiles or computer laptop pads

yeah that's true and that would lead to an advanced yeah if we have
yeah we're going on to that later with the advanc with the l c d  that means we'd need a really advanced chip and
it's unlikely that that's gonna be in our budget um also we've got the integrated pushbutton
which is what we're most familiar with it's the most straightforward but you can in like incorporate that with a scroll button as well
got decisions to make there and this is what i was just saying before linked in the different depends on what type of buttons
we have and the inputs um simple would go with the pushbutton
um regular you could link with the scroll button and the advanced we'd have to
go with a l c d  s display my personal preferences
i think we could go for the kinetic energy source i don't i think that's quite um an advanced kind of technology
it's not been seen before so it could be quite a a novelty factor attractive as well and
also energy saving 'cause you're producing the energy you don't need an external
sort of battery supply or solar panels you just give it a shake sounds brilliant to me
rubber casing i thing would probably the best if we're going for the anti r s i  and like
more choice with um aesthetics like it could be pretty much any colour we want um
and gives you yeah more flexibility there and probably the regular chip as opposed
to the simple then we could possibly have the scroll and the push but no l c d  'cause we
probably can't afford that one
mm hmm
i think that would uh there would be an in sort of more internal casing and the rubber would just be the what's in contact with the human yeah
yeah
maybe if the um if it was just kind of a more of a rubber coating which was on to a case so it was kind of the whole thing would be removable
yeah like i can't think of what
yeah or like an you can get sort of outer casing for ipods and something that's just it's protective
as well it it stops it i mean it would reduce the impact if it was dropped or something as well 'cause it wouldn't damage
itself so easily i think i maybe a mixture of both there maybe yeah
and then yeah yeah
yeah
as far as i know it should be
yeah yeah yeah
yeah i thought that was
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah like as a backup for something
yeah
yeah some alternative just in case something went wrong
that's true i just thought of that yeah yeah may maybe that could be the backup instead of a battery like solar backup
yeah i suppose s but some
but thing is it's not you don't need the solar all the time it can be stored it can be like you can have the solar energy and then it can store that energy and use it it just needs to be in light for a certain amount of time per day like a few hours a day
that's true it could easily
yeah i suppose it would be really annoying if you get to think oh no i forgot to
charge my remote today like if the kinetic thing i think what's best about that is that it's instant energy you don't have to
you know you can shake it a few times or whatever and it works yeah instead of you don't have to
like make sure it's in the right place to charge and
k okay
yeah
there we go
it wasn't on mine either i don't know why i think i just i just used the mouse on there
yeah
mm
yeah so i suppose sometime after you
mm

i s i suppose where um mm on some buttons you would have like the power would be
s some kind of symbol and if you wanted to go onto teletext or i know we're not having that but i mean a similar
thing you they have there's a like little picture with a screen with lines across it which i suppose it's that sort of thing like the
the symbol on the button but if we're having a simplified display anyway w that we
probably won't have to focus so much on that it'll be more the on the numbers and the volume
i suppose we need to think of symbols for like the volume display and stuff like that
i
for inp
mm
yeah
yeah that's true that's in like the buttons with all the different like colours for different choices and things it can be a bit yeah overwhelming
yep
oh
i'd assume like an internal light that comes through so there would have to have to be some parts maybe transparent around the buttons or something
yeah yeah
it should be able to mm hmm
li yeah
mm hmm
i think it would be possible i don't think it would make that much difference i mean the uh the dimensions
of it 'cause if it's just like constructed in the same way as like the front cover of a mobile phone
you can like take off the hard cover and then there's the like say the buttons and then you get to the circuit i don't think it would
matter that the buttons were bigger through the the top casing i'm sure you could
f work it out to fit in the casing without causing too much difficulty i'm sure that'd be fine

okay
you're not plugged in yet
mm
it is strange
well
we
i think we possibly could take a more abstract design like look at the basic shapes of
different fruits and vegetables and then just really like strip it down to like
really basic shapes i mean we don't have to make something in the shape of a strawberry
but it could have the curves of a strawberry or something or a strawberry seed or a leaf or just
like you know really make it a quite abstract if that's fits in more with what we're
doing instead of fruits and vegetables just if you look at it straightforward it's a bit yeah it doesn't s quite
fit in with the trendy well obviously it does if that's the current theme but may maybe we could go more
directly i don't know but initially i dunno i think if we just sort of tone it down
a bit
yeah and like not not yeah
mm
yeah
i didn't for the first one but i have now yeah uh hopefully project documents i think
okay
'kay
kinetic yeah are we going to have a backup
or do we just
i think maybe we could just go for the kinetic energy and
be bold and innovative and hope this works and well hope that it works i think yeah i think no i i think we should just like take uh advantage of like using this to its full potential go for it
it could be fully kinetic energy yeah
is everyone happy with that
yeah
um it was whether we went for the simple the regular or the advanced chip and that linked in with what buttons we would gonna have so
yeah it was so that was without the l c d  so that means we're not doing the advanced so it depends on whether we wanted the scroll buttons or just the push buttons
uh so that's the simple
yeah possibly so it's probably gonna be the regular chip that we're going to need so it's a medium so regular chip regular sorry
regular chip
lighting yeah if we because of the lighting that we've decided to put in as well
so th
i think this is just like gonna be the a very outer case which we will decide on rubber
rubber yeah plastic rubber coat
interchangeable yeah still going for that yeah
your screen
was it
ouch
the power
volume
may yeah tone contrast and things that's a bit
yeah it was minima well it wasn't the l
yeah that would be good yeah and surely that would be like quite specific to the individual television so
mm i think most of that comes like on the i individual television set itself doesn't it i'm sure it has its own buttons so you don't necessarily need to have it on remote

yeah so we're just going for power channels volume
mm

i've
yeah that's it we can just go for make it a selling point that it is just the basic yeah uh i brilliant
mm hmm
okay um i just have one question about the
whole fruit and vegetable aspect are we seeing as that was the most
popular thing that came up out of your market research i thi i think we should keep to that rather than moving to animals
or something because even if that may not seem obvious to us if that's what the surveys brought
out i think that we should probably go along with that um so i suppose that'll come out in our dev
design development but you're happy to go ahead with the fruit and veg
y yeah
we can have a look at those ideas yeah
yeah
yeah
tricky a lot of things to consider hm
okay
okay thank you
yeah
yeah


yeah
w
like plastic with rubber kind of on top
well there's there is a certain phone that has like a rubber casing b like a nokia it is it's yeah

yeah
yeah

yeah tha

backup yeah
that would be good yeah
maybe we could you were saying about um solar power ma maybe not working indoors but a lot of calculators yeah have solar power so maybe that could be incorporated as
yeah
do do those calculators yeah
i don't know how it works
yeah
yeah
yeah


yeah
yeah i suppose
yeah
yeah
thanks
oh

it's not on my screen why
you don't know why oh okay
is it that one
um i'm just gonna go through the interface concept with yous now uh
first of all i'll explain what a user interface is it's the aspects of a computer system
which can be seen or otherwise perceived for example heard or felt maybe
or by the human user
and it's also the commands that the user uses to control its operation and to input data
um there are two types of user interfaces there's the graphical user interface which
emphasises the use of pictures for output and a pointing device for example a mouse for input control
so that's sort of like the scroll thing we were talking about
yeah
i'm not really sure about the pictures that maybe that's on an l c d  screen or maybe it's
the the buttons or pictures or something
do you think it's

yeah yeah
so you must for the graphical user you must need some kind of presentation for the graphics like an l c d  screen
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
no i think it's to do with the actual symbols that are on the that's on the buttons of the remote control and per
well it could be a wee scroller thing and something could come up on the screen
yeah
but um
i think we're gonna go with the command interface anyway to make it more simplistic but the we could
incorporate some of the graphical user um points as in
just to make it m um nicer to look at maybe
like i can't think of an example but
sort of like little pictures rather than
like a little sound instead of saying volume like a little speaker or something yeah something y
yeah m perha yeah yeah maybe
um the co uh we've decided that the command interface would be the most useful for a remote control as it would be less complicated and the controls would be more user friendly
um the remote control would be cheaper to design so that we'd have more money in the budget to um target the design area of the interface you know make it more trendy and original we'll have more money if we keep it simple
yeah
seeing as it's quite a new technology um

we we also have to keep in mind when we're designing our um more user friendly
remote control that a lot of interfaces consist of a clutter of buttons that
um that their functions colours and forms aren't always helpful
yeah
yeah
and that all interfaces are different so um that doesn't improve the use of the produ product so we need to come up with something that's easy to understand
and maybe learn from the mistakes of other interfaces that can be too complicated for people to use
does anyone have any questions
mm
but um
yeah
in the phone that i was thinking of as well when you change the um covers of it
the the little buttons that actually you know that contro control stuff are behind
the rubber so you can change the buttons when you're changing the faces do you know what i mean 'cause it's just
the wee control yeah thing that's behind it
so
i mean we don't have to decide on one colour each face could have its own colour of buttons maybe
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah

so that's everything then
yeah



yeah

yeah
yeah yeah
yeah

yeah
or banana shaped
yeah
where do you have to save it to
okay
just escape i think
yeah

yeah
hope so
yeah
yeah i don yeah
yeah it's for the lighting yeah
yeah
yeah plastic coat
we decided on the component i i i'm sorry i've lost my um
powerpoint thing so i can't remember what it's ca it's the component
the command inter
the command line interface yeah
yeah
um
i think that is well we haven't really made any decisions about
what we're gonna do about the cluster of button functions colours and forms in the in consistent use
like what what are ideas to combat these problems you know how um different interfaces
are very different and can be confusing because because of their difference and because
of the different clusters of buttons that they have
we haven't really decided what to do about that
well it's just um
w where where shall we locate the buttons what kind of functions wi shall we have
so pretty just just the basic button functions
yeah
yeah each television
you don't change that often yeah
yeah
yeah

it w it would seem silly if we'd having anything else just have an audio button though
do you know
but we
yeah
that could be a sales pitch
simple and
yeah


yeah
what i
what i was thinking what do yous think of this um having the numbers kind of like not a bunch of grapes but you know like purple and kind of in a triangle
like grapes like that's kind of fruity or something that's just


yeah

okay

yes


mm
mm hmm

mm hmm
mm hmm
like the skin yeah
okay
so the actual remote would be hard plastic and the casings rubber okay and the buttons obviously are rubber
okay


mm hmm
i guess it's a bit scary 'cause it hasn't been done before
so it seems we'd have to do more research on it or i dunno if you could have a battery pack
yeah so there's there is a one battery because most remotes use two batteries i believe so if it was running off of one battery as a
right
although it needs some light doesn't it
so if we're doing yeah if we're
yeah
yeah i think sometimes it's just shoved under under a cushion and yeah
yeah
so it's just draf graphical for the pointing aspect
the infrared is like that's considered a
okay so when it says pointing device that doesn't include
okay
okay
mm hmm
mm
i think if we go with the um design plate thing we'll have to just because of colour clashing and if we wanted to so and and we might i mean depending on what comes out of the design we might have to stick to just black buttons
you mean different colours for the lighting or
mm hmm
oh i see what you're saying
well y
oh so you're picturing the light is coming from the back i kinda pictured it as kind of coming from the sides and lighting it up frontwards
but but i guess you mean from the back okay
okay
right
mm hmm
oh yeah they they insert over
okay
t
okay is that my turn then
alright
i have a shorter report for you today um it took a while to get this uh
uh
oh that's a very good point
okay so um this report is about uh trend watching um basically so we can live up to our our uh purpose of having a very fashionable remote control sorry there we go
um so just so you know my method was mainly web web based research this time around i also spoke with fashion experts
in milan new york and paris and i looked at the design reports from previous years here at real remote
um just so c we can work off of them see how fashions have changed
um so i'll list the three most important aspects that i've come across um and they they're each more important than
the one that comes after it uh the first one is that there should be a fancy look and feel instead of the current functional
look and feel um this should be our priority as we've been saying
the second most important aspect is that a remote sh that the remote control should be technologically innovative so i think we've done a lot of talking about that just with lighting and the buttons and the
face plates um so it looks like we'll be able to keep on track with that and the third most important aspect is that the remote control should be easy to use
so pretty basic there
and the recent fashion update uh according to fashion watchers in paris and milan is that fruit and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes shoes and furniture
um also in contra uh in contrast to last year the feel of the material is expected to be spongy again we've already discussed that with rubber versus hard plastic buttons
um
so my personal preferences here
um of course as we we've already talked about the personal face plates in this meeting and i'd like to stick to that the fruits and vegetable
themes i don't know if that's going to work for us it sounds something that you'd use on kitchenware i don't know if we wanna do it on remotes
it could be one of the options maybe for the television that people have in their kitchen
um the temporary light up idea sounds like we're gonna stick to that and then uh tying in a trendy look with user friendliness
mm hmm

it's it's a little but it it's everywhere so maybe we i've seen a lot of purses with olives on them you know but i i think i think if we stick to t v  based you know maybe t v  shows or
or colour schemes
right
yeah the
the essence of strawberry yeah

i guess yeah
one thing i was thinking though is i dunno if you all remember from our kickoff meeting we talked about our favourite animals so maybe there could be animal based you know because a lot of people have a house cat or or a dog
um that might be getting you know too specific and we should see what the success of the first face plates are but it's something to keep in mind
and did you have any questions
pretty straightforward
okay
there you go

have you guys been saving your powerpoint presentations to the okay
the powerpoint
so
so if it's not working they just have to shake it a bit and that revitalises it okay
mm hmm
oh is regular not simple
right right right
think it was called command interface
command interface


mm hmm
that was on um
one of my presentations about how often it was used do you remember that
i w
should i bring it up
the ch t
screen settings was used um zero point five times an hour so tw twice every once every two hours
um and it was considered a one point five relevance on a scale of ten that's brightness colour tone all that
mm hmm
the other one was audio settings mono stereo pitch i mean i sometimes use that some t v s will have the option of like living
room style movie style um and that they say that's used zero point eight times an hour which is actually
somewhat high like almost once an hour um relevance of two

well that didn't some up on mine
oh
yeah i guess that it affects the marketing 'cause it mm it is a good sales ploy to say aren't you annoyed with remote controls that have all these buttons this one has channel volume and your channe and your power
yeah
okay
mm hmm
yeah
now do you guys need want an idea of how many uh are you gonna come up with casing ideas like f five different
mm hmm
yeah you can have some fun with the buttons it's true
yeah
i guess what you i ideally you'd kind of think of age markets as well so it's a something that will you know appeal to the fifteen to twenty five year olds something that your granny would want on her remote control um and international tastes as well so
not easy

okay

think we can first
right i just wanna 'cause basically i can't re i've really crap at remembering everyone's name so i just wanna rather
than going uh miss marketing and miss this and miss that wanted to know your names again just
gonna leave this up here 'cause i'll you know so
okay and gabriel
e l  is it
'kay
and you're s r r e i s s 
okay
's just a bit nicer calling people by their names i think uh right
okay right welcome to meeting b  um this is gonna go a lot better than the last meeting
basically uh 'cause i know what i'm supposed to be doing now i am your project manager
and uh yeah i'm just here to
sort of liaise between the three of you and get things going get people talking and and i'm gonna be
making notes and sending them off to the powers that be and stuff basically
um right this for the purposes of this meeting what this meeting is
all about is um i'm gonna have some presentations from
all three of you what you've been working on for the last
wee while when you haven't been getting hit with spam on your computers and and you know
filling out silly questionnaires and things but hopefully you've been actually been doing something productive
so we're gonna each of you gonna give us a litt a little presentation um
then we're gonna work you know from each of your presentations we'll we'll uh talk about
what we actually need as a final coming together of it all um and then we'll yeah we'll
sort of conclude anything else comes up at the end of it
this meeting it's not very long it's uh probably down to about thirty five minutes now so i want each of
your presentations to not be too long five five minutes something like that
um if you haven't done a powerpoint thingy it doesn't matter it it just it just says that you it's
that's just one particular medium if you haven't had time to prepare one you can draw stuff on the noteboard
you can talk to us you can you know however you want to do your little presentation basically you
can
don't feel pressurised into using this thing 'cause i don't
uh okay so um you
okay over there reissa are you uh b are you joining in with this meeting here
or are y or are y or are you are you just are you just uh doing some internet shopping there
okay jolly good alright let's have um well we all know that it's it's a
remote control that we're gonna be dealing with i think the first thing we should look at is um
probably the um what it is that it is actually supposed to be so that's gonna be you catherine
if we wanna hear from you first
you don't have to worry about screwing it in just there you go
ah
mm hmm
mm hmm
great okay
i prefer the pe i prefer the human touch personally yeah
do you wanna just give us a moment i just wanna copy this down um i dunno if you guys have got any questions for catherine on any of this
yeah you blow on it and i
yeah it's worked for the last fifty years you know
how far away is your television
it's never gonna be more than it's never gonna be you kno unless you've got a t v  the size of a football pitch it's not doesn't have to go that far does it doesn't have to go through a wall because you're not gonna be looking through a wall
yeah yeah i d it sounds like you you w don't wanna overcomplicate things you know we don't need it
yeah exactly basically we're we're desi we're designing and marketing a television remote control unit
we're not w w w w designing something that you can plug in a headset to and and you know connect to your laptop
computer and stuff it's uh
okay
right well done catherine um gab gabriel let's uh let's hear from you on on on such things
mm hmm
mm yeah
okay
mm hmm
yeah
great
yeah
great okay now that's i just have a q a q question for you this
w um research that you've been doing looki looking at other you know existing units
stuff um have you found that anyone else has do has looked into the locking
function or
yeah
yeah
um
i would say
it's
if it's simple to do
which i think it probably should be even if it's a physical you know a f a like a f a physical switch
or a physical cover for the remote even something like that um
then yes it's like you know like s you said earlier on ab ab ab a flip
thing something like that but you know being physical look into um i've
had word down from head office that something that we should be centred well
something we should take into account is um we've gotta keep the corporate image
within this remote control unit it's gotta d look like it's in the r  and r 
you know the the company it's it's from what i can see from our other products are yellow with blue writing on them um
we put the fashion in electronics there you go
so it's kinda gotta look it's gotta look new and s you know something fashionable if if remote control well if telephones can be fashionable then maybe remote control units can be
yeah because we need

yeah great
okay fantastic right well done gabriel um reissa let's plug you in baby
yeah w it it just takes a wee while
'cause we've only got five channels
i think that's k flicking quickly between channels
yeah
wow you are a child of technology aren't you
so there you go yeah
uh but do the younger generation have the money they they don't it's older generation they're the ones that have gone out and
people people from the age of thirty f there's a big drop off there for people up to the age of thirty five you're kinda saying yeah they want it
um but no they're not sort of most people that have the money are people from the age of thirty five to fifty five
uh 'cause they're the ones that have been working for twenty years um d and tha and that's a that's
quite a minority there so yeah it's not even like fifty fifty that's th thirty five per cent
yeah
i would say scra i'd say scrap that straight off
so y so it's so it's so you got so that's something we should have a look into then i when
desi when designing the ergonomics of see have a look if um there's any w
any medical background we can find out about this
let's jus we just want need to cover our arses so that people aren't gonna sue us in ten years' time say your remote control gave me repetitive strain injury
yeah they're having a lunch break at the moment but yeah i'll see if i can get see if i can get hold of them for the next meeting
yeah
okay that's great thank you very much for that reissa um okay so we've basically
we've decide we've d
we've decided that it's gonna be you know uh we're going for a basic television remote it's gotta
be safe to use it's gotta look cool
it's gotta be cheap s um
now going back to the uh industrial design of it you know we were looking at whether
to use maybe infra red or bluetooth i think we should just go with
the simplest option on everything uh and that would be infra red
energy source that would be batteries uh mean we we can look into using the s you know the little
tiny weeny batteries all like special long lasting batteries um
but a in there's no i don't think there's any point in making a remote control unit that's gonna last for fifty
years because technology will have changed and you know we won't have televisions in ten years' time
so
i think we're all um pretty sussed on that
um
anyone have any questions everybody happy in their work
now this is good we've got a good structure going on we all know where we're going to have you been ge has have any of you lot been getting loads of crap spam on your computers

yeah
yeah stuff um okay do oh have you guys found out if we can if we can e mail stuff to each other
right do all you all know my e mail address
can you all d e mail me your e mail addresses
send me yeah yeah okay
is it yellow and black or is it yellow and blue i i kind of thought it was blue writing on a yellow background but i might be just going a bit
okay well
maybe you can come up with a few with a couple of different ideas
well see the thing is is we've gotta keep the company image it's gotta say people have gotta look at this remote control and instantly recognise that it's a real reaction i product
there's loads of companies that called r r 
this is slog but this is the slogan this is the the the the type
yeah
well not necessarily but we have to incorporate it
not necessarily even if i it just has to ye but you have to look at the product and instantly know that it's
one of our products as opposed to a sony product or a you know a panasonic product it's
got to so maybe so you can have a look at our our other products and see if they all follow a s
similar vein perhaps
yeah
yeah
quite poss yeah well this is all your department
mm okay well well done everybody and um i think we uh stop for lunch now
we might possibly have done
if we've if we've finished at five minutes before the meeting's supposed to finish then that means we get an extra five minutes for lunch
yeah there you go
right i just have to there's a few little bits and pieces i have to write down but
take your headsets off kick back smoke 'em if you got 'em
mm
tha
okay who is gonna do a powerpoint presentation
you will as well
okay
yep
okay i'm
okay
i'm catherine with a c  c a t h 
e r 
i n e 
right
true




how long is the meeting
okay
no problem


okay
okay um just connecting this
are we getting i
really okay cool okay so i've got a very quick uh
uh
okay
so the working design i've got a very quick presentation on this so um
i've oh no you can't see a thing oh well i'm gonna draw it on the board then
it's in blue uh and i couldn't change it we it's fine on my screen but never mind so
um the idea is that we've got the
energy source um which in our case
will pr oh well okay never mind so um i think maybe
uh two batteries i dunno what they're called six or something like that
uh and then
um
then on the uh remote control itself will have um the sender for the signal which could be uh
an infra red signal
um which will be sent by an electronic chip
and uh the chip will be controlled by the user interface
so we'll hear about that later from gabriel and uh the sender
will send to the telly itself an infra red signal to tell it
to switch on or switch channels
um and that's it really for the working design
sorry the presentation wasn't very uh clear but
really cool
um should i erase this or
okay
fine
or suggestions
well it's just you don't want it plugged in really s
in indoors


i dunno swi i th i th i think changing your batteries once every six months is not really a pain but
yeah
well the thing is uh you you don't
well we can make the the signal strong enough to go through walls if if you fancy it
i didn't think about that
but
why not
i just think that it's it's gonna cost more and i'm i'm not sure it's you're gonna use it
it's a fancy idea uh it's quite nice but then i don't th i dunno either you if you wanna watch the telly you're in the room you are gonna
but
oh we can we can keep the idea if you i
we can see at a later stage maybe i don't
do you need the border
okay
sorry




well maybe they shouldn't watch so much t v  then
maybe it could be instead of pressing button it could be just touching a

yep
well in the project announcement you've got the addresses i think so project manager it's participant one at a m i 
you have them i you have them but we'll send you an e mail you want to have friends don't you
it wouldn't be
well you could
it could come
but it could come in different colours and have the r r  colours just somewhere like just around the lock button could be the r r  logo or colours and
if
cool
right it was function f  eight or something
this one right there
okay
think we all
huh
oh i thought we all were yeah i have one too okay
s
whoops i forgot to put the thing on
okay
yeah sure that's a good idea
uh gabriel
e l 


think she's finishing up her presentation
oh
yeah alternate energy source like win wind power or
bicycle power
one question i have and i don't know how much control we have over this is um as far as the infra red signal do we have control
over you know how far away you can be from the receiving unit the the t v  and still have it be operational i
mean maybe we want one with a strong signal stream
uh
that's true
okay
uh i'm just gonna use the powerpoint uh
technical okay
okay so while this is warming up there it is uh
so i'm doing the user interface design
yeah and basically uh as far as methods i was i was looking looking at
looking at uh already existing remotes trying to find some inspiration from designs that are already out there
thinking of what we can retain what we can do away with uh what we what we can perfect
a little bit as far as design um we don't want to do something that's too radical of a change i guess i mean people
want a remote that's familiar that has their favourite functionalities um and
and does the basics but
um so we can improve what's out there and maintain that
the basic functionality that people want
um so things that seem like absolute must haves uh would be a volume control
um so up down keys for that uh channel keys up down but then also a numerical
key pad so that they can just key directly to the channel that they want rather than doing up down and uh
a mute button uh one thing that i didn't include here that i forgot that we talked about last
time was doing um some sort of lock uh function uh i don't i dunno uh that's
one possibility
and so in the research that i was doing
there's basically two types of remotes ones that are engineering centred and ones that are more user centred which i don't know if i can access the web page from here but i can show you uh
yeah so this is a engineer centred one so you see it's rather busy but it also
lets you play your movie stop your movie fast forward all this um freeze frame
uh and this is a user centred one uh it's it's easier to g just glance at this
and see what's possible to do you're not gonna be staring at it for five minutes and i
judging from what what we all talked about during our last meeting i kind of gathered that that's what we were going after uh
or the direction we were going in at least um
so the engineering centred ones uh provide a lot of functionality but it can be a little bit overwhelming so the user
centred ones just focus on ease of use uh and this sort of overlaps with what the
marketing person uh reissa because uh we we need to find out what what people want
before we make firm decisions on this so uh yeah that's me
no that that that seemed like a novel idea as f as far as i know i mean obviously another exists like you like you said in in mobile phones that was sort of the inspiration for it um i've never seen that with in in all my years in in the remote business
i've haven't i've never seen a locking functionality
i dunno what uh do you guys have a a yea or nay on that a feeling about whether that's really necessary
yeah
mm hmm
'kay
right
mm
right
and our motto is is we put the fashion in electronics
i think i think we have to carry that mental
mm
well yeah these i think we can so we talked about the layout in my presentation and what i didn't mention yet really is is the sort of like the ergonomic design i t i think we can make big improvements over these two that you see here i mean
uh everything is going t ergonomic you know there's you know mice for your computers that are very ergonomic and keyboards and that could be one of our niches p sort of uh uh in the market i guess um
yeah
uh yeah this is getting all mm
yeah then you just have to do function f  eight and it should come up
yeah it just takes a second uh
yeah you wanna navigate the channels quickly i guess
mm
no i would i would say the older the older people yeah
yeah that would be my guess as well
what about just from the the prospective of our manufacturing cost i mean if if it's twelve fifty per unit i mean okay there's
uh
repetitive strain uh rep repetitive strain injury or like from doing

mm
mm
yeah we should probably consult with our legal department uh
yeah
i think we can do some really in in that department the the ergonomic department we can make some some really good improvements
mm
yeah it seems like we're all on the pretty much on the same page
oh it's probably just you 'cause you're the project manager
sell trying to sell your things
okay
no i don't i
uh
oh it's just participant one oh okay yeah
well it's just w it's just it's just par participant one participant two
so are we headed towards like a b a big yellow and black remote as far as maybe that's our next meeting that we discuss that
well it's like white on i white and blue on a black background with white with yellow borders maybe that's like getting ahead of ourselves
mm
mm
mm
mm
and this is something that came on down from from the higher ups so i mean we are sort of beholden to them
not one colour but the pattern needs to be recognisable
yeah pretty soon i think i guess that's now
alright see you all soon
i am reissa r e i s s a 
double s  a  yeah yeah sorry

mm 'kay


mm
i'm fine yeah
i uh yeah yeah d i mean i i'm finishing off my presentation
no no
uh i'm done okay
mm

is a battery like
the only way of
no no
no i meant like
no 'cause like cha 'cause always changing um um batteries can get like annoying the battery's down and maybe i dunno solar charged
mm yeah
yeah but if like you're on the phone in the other room and you need turn television off or something and you don't really want to go into the put the telephone down and go into the other room
how about bluetooth
instead of using infra red
use bluetooth
isn't that a better signal
mm
mm
's just an idea


adjusting
yeah

mm

mm
mm
mm
okay
where does it go into
here the blue thing

well function f  eight
no oh
come on
right okay okay well
for our marketing report uh we observed remote control users in a usability lab
and also gave so this is research and we also gave participants um questionnaires to fill
out um total number of people tested were a hundred just so you know so that hundred people were tested
and these were the findings so seventy five per cent of users find the remote control ugly
okay so they don't like the look of the remote control um eighty f eighty per cent of them would spend more money
if the rem remote control looked really cool and fancy so i think we all agree with that um
current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user
so they don't like like the way they operate it doesn't
like match how people behave um per cent of the users say that they only
use ten per cent of the buttons on a remote so probably if you have like one two three four five the whole up
to z ten they probably don't use those they only use the up and down channel
exactly that's another thing um seventy five per cent of users say they zap
not quite sure what they mean zap goes like
yeah
mm um takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote i think especially for uh the older
generation i know my grandmother doesn't like mobile phones takes ages to work how to use
anyway um and they also remotes often get lost in the room so nobody can find them
so maybe tracking devices is a good idea um personal preferences

um so yeah um i was thinking something easy to use especially for older people um
has to look really cool flashy groovy for people to buy it and it's
easy to find so i don't know whether maybe and also we asked them
whether they wanted whether they'd be interested in um voice activating
so voice activation so and this was what we came up with then if you look fifteen
to twenty five this is age sorry age groups so fifteen to twenty five said
like ninety two ninety one per cent of them said yes um so
basically the majority except for the forty five to fifty five year olds for some reason didn't want a voice activated one and neither did the older generation
but the younger generation who we are catering for like who have most of the money nowadays do want a voice act speech recognition
in a remote
well the twenty five to thirty five year old and thirty five and the thirty five to forty five forty five point seven per cent say no so

so they don't
well
these guys are growing up

voice activation might not be the best
um also with um with buttons a thing called r s i  so wrist sense huh
yeah repetitive strains injury so they don't i think people who watch t v  maybe too often keep changing channel hurts their wrist i don't think so
yeah maybe not so hard
yeah
maybe
mm
yeah
mm maybe th the buttons not so high up so you don't have to press so much or we just like flat buttons something
yeah
so that is me
mm
mm
mm
well just questionnaires

yeah you can
i think he's participant one aren't you

can't we have different colours in the remotes so somebody can choose different col like does it have to be of a certain
but if it's a r r  it would be real reaction like if it had a symbol on it
whoa
so we have to have it one colour
mm
mm
mm
are we are we finished ahead of schedule

'kay uh
do you need to change anything on it because otherwise i will already open it
okay
is it much changes
uh i didn't no no i do hot have
only the same information

hello sebastian
i believe uh miss uh tentel is with us as well in the control room
oh it's that roo again always late bongiorno
hmm
i see some interesting okay
people welcome back
the third meeting um i have some points i would like to uh some some issues
i would like to point out um first of all um if you make
minutes yourself as well uh like sebastian does um could you put them on the shared folder
if you do not make minutes no problem but it's easy for me to see what you uh wrote down so i could uh can uh um use that in the in the report um the second thing um
i was th uh s thinking to myself i have this little remote control and i'm talking to it but i still need to point to the television because it works with infrared
that's quite strange
okay we'll come to that later i g i think um the agenda for now uh uh are there any pre discussion questions
okay um we wi we will have your individual presentations
uh then the decision on the remote control concept um and uh the closing
forty minutes in total for this so um i think we we can immedis immediately
start with the individual presentations um the progress you've made
um i think it might be smart to look at uh ruud's um information first
because i understood there are some uh significant changes in the market situation
um yeah

uh w wait a sec wait a se uh could you go to the previous slide um because i'm taking minutes and it
um were the important themes enclose yeah okay the feel of to be spongy

okay so so yeah it might not be t uh it it shouldn't be too hard it it maybe it rubber or or yeah okay
yeah
well that's interesting
you could make a few v very colourful ones and uh a very traditional co cover
yeah yeah
yeah it is it is i yeah
yeah
do you know the phone
it's the siemens uh c  twenty five i believe it's it's the one the post bank uh gave away the very
you kn you know ruud as well about th
okay okay um uh okay do you have uh thit that was
okay okay so the the m uh important findings are uh innovation is more important
than ease of use for the our target group and um colouring is important
and and uh soft materials okay
okay roo
could you do your presentation
okay well it's good to to sum up uh the things we already thought about
shape

yeah and what i'm thinking about maybe um we should make very light but um uh
a grip um i mean this is how you hold a remote control
um it shouldn't be too uh glatt too slippery
s because um
yeah yeah exactly
yeah
yeah ex for your fingers yeah
yeah it grips automatically yeah okay
okay good
yeah way too much i think for our goal yeah
okay b but i think we'll yeah
okay

well it would be very new to the market but
yeah

i think um if if i can hook on to that um the kinetic thing
is very funny i mean solar is of course it's nice but it's well
your uh your calculator has a solar panel um hand dynamo
well maybe m
yeah i know
yeah
yeah
and wha
okay
yeah
okay because i guess the voice recognition feature u consumes quite a f uh a lot of power yeah
okay
well
this will be the remote right um with uh maybe a channel selector
what about
integrating a scroll bar on this side
because this is how you keep it
volume
well what about mute
thi i i m i guess uh th this is my volume button and i can either on this side or this side um
and click it to muten the device
and and it makes it different from the traditional uh devices on this market so i'm looking for a way to
uh make it a little different than the traditional ones so maybe um i guess
that that's something you two uh need to think about uh ruud wha what do you thing about
uh a scroll bar uh scroll wheel
okay
yeah
well all the sony telephones use it for example for volume nokia has a well okay it's not really a scroll wheel but on their side th the the volume button is on the side because you gri grab it like this
yeah i know it's not really a scroll wheel no yeah
for you too yeah
okay sebastian um
yeah

it performs the action yeah
yeah
okay uh well uh d did we already decide on the display
to
no
on screen display yeah okay th
okay good
kineti okay
okay it's maybe a bit too too flashy too yeah
yeah but that that's the same with the solar cell that's no different
yeah okay
no no but the uh um that's what sebastian said he said uh this is what uh this is my personal preference but but yet i understood that the market is different so um
no r rubber with colours
colourful and
yeah
but but do we want the curved uh uh design or
i it's too dull yeah
yeah
okay okay
okay what about um the issue i um addressed at the beginning
of the meeting um the voice function w with the infrared
uh issue because it it's of cour
yeah
well
it depends also on your on your
well it depends on your walls actually if you have uh have um smooth walls it it it probably
you're probably right but if you have carpets on the wall which our natural loving friends
probably do have then um yeah th th it might be a bit more of a issue
so
yeah
i like the scroll wheels uh idea
yeah
well it looks uh yeah well um according to ruud the the the market likes um
new flashy technology and i mean l c d  is well ok i know but it's m it's
less um s standard than than
well we are not very w we do not know uh much about the the f the financial part that's the problem because if we do have enough um space in in our finance i would say do integrate it because
it it adds a little ext extra high tech feeling to it
mm yeah
okay okay
yeah okay i i agree i think i ruud do you have any um anything you would like to
um add or or maybe thoughts or
no sebast uh nee roo roo do you have any other
nothing more um
sebas
well we we need to describe uh decisions now so um on the energy well we decided chip
the case uh rubber with uh c one one uh one curve user interface um
um then the corporate identity should be uh in the product i guess that is something for roo and sebastian uh you talked about it before the colours grey and yellow
keep it in mind and um the buttons well we talked about it now the next phase um
sebastian um is um the design of the look and feel
the user interface design and for you the product evaluation um
i'm sure your personal coach will give you more information on that um and
uh the i d  and the u i d  need to work together on the prototype drawing on the smartboard
and i'm going uh to plan my holidays
yeah it's it's uh when we come back in thirty minutes uh you will have a uh prototype ready
yeah i can um maybe one of you could write it down great um
uh you you need to help me um
the casing is curved single curved
traditional batteries uh and solar
no they can be complementary uh al al i uh
every device
yeah okay um th
battery and solar yeah
yeah with colourful rubber uh if it's possible with uh different um covers but i'm not sure if our suppliers can uh can help us with uh with such uh uh a wish
uh grey and yellow or black and yellow yeah
yeah although i don't think that's very colourful except for the yellow of course but um i could think of a more uh attractive uh c uh set of colours
well i was more thinking about the fruit colours that the ruud showed us before
well it it doesn't have to be red
uh i mean th uh i think these colours are really what our young people are looking for um
so maybe it shouldn't even be two colours it should be a full colour cover with such an image
or or i mean thinking in two colours is is too black and white for our m uh
c uh market group i guess
black and yellow yeah
okay so we have to deal with wh what's possible here
yeah okay um more f more more decisions we made um
um
the scroll heel yes the voice recognition we already decided
yeah
uh i'm going to leave that up to you two
yeah
i think rubber is nice because it uh i i mean what do you touch the button and what do they want spongy uh uh devices or or i
uh is that uh does our our supplier say so
yeah you could place a um uh this this would be the button
the scroll wheel i mean and you could place
the indica th th the signals the
no no there's no painting only uh yellow or
but it's into the rubber
yeah but this is on the pla yeah i know um i think uh i know which you understand af uh i know what you mean what about um making this rubber
and making this plastic
yeah well actually we should have it the other way around i guess a plastic cover with rubber finishing
i mean this is this is the finishing this is um what's on the edge what you feel
but the front
on which the the buttons are doesn't have to be rubber i mean
i know but do you touch this or do you touch this
i mean i i never touch between the buttons
yeah the side exactly the sideways the side but do you touch between the the these buttons
okay well we do not have very much time uh left um i guess you two have to figure that out
i'm going to leave the decision to you um because you have to make its prototype and um
yeah y you have the most knowledge about the suppliers the possibilities and uh so i'm going to
leave it the decision with you um sebastian did you write enough decisions down
yeah
okay with those regular chips we can still uh control advanced functions the chip is is not really
okay well
yeah okay um okay then i think we are uh quite finished
um i'll see you guys in thirty minutes and um
yeah yeah um if you write wrote anything down uh could you put it on the shared folder
yeah
i know but well
great
right

bongiorno
punish
you wish
welcome uh
yeah

no
alright





but they like dark colours you said in the p
okay
well then i suggest that the corporate colours are grey and yellow i had
or we could make oh
yeah o o
i'm thinking about uh the bananarama telephone uh telephone from uh siemens the yellow uh rubber telephone it's the it's the rubber uh
cover and it's uh colourful it looks likes a banana we have the fruit we have the colours we have the simple design
um thirty five
and the b the light blue and it's also in yellow
yeah
mm hmm
well i don't ha really have much to add um because most of things we already said in uh
the previous uh discussion
um
uh the previous ideas were voice recognition and uh the round button for uh the p channel programming
and uh volume well a few interface i uh i found on the internet
are are these these are both with uh with voice recognition but they're very advanced and
very high tech and just um well a weird um
shape so i suggest i couldn't uh i had a small uh mock up
uh sign on the on paper but it didn't work my pen didn't
load um the information so i made a really simple f uh a shape
on uh in um
powerpoint but we could make uh a round uh an oval uh um remote control uh yellow
but if you have something like uh the siemens phone it's rubber so it's easy in your hand uh indeed
yeah
great
oh and um to add on um ruud's information in this um interface
we can have uh high tech with the voice recognition and uh well the the fancy colours
and uh and so on and still have the ease of use because we have an easy
interface and all the other remote controls are high tech in buttons and uh and so on
yeah
so if you have the voice recognition you can you can programme like thirty uh um
thirty c uh controls on it
yeah
right

great

like the watch
but if you're watching a movie how many times uh you take the the remote control and and if uh if you have a watch you have the kinetic uh idea in a watch also you you walk and uh but uh you you're sitting on a couch
mm hmm
mm hmm
oh we can just make four push buttons in a form of a round
but i th i don't think uh the scroll wheels i had some i had some information about it too i don't
think there's any possibility for us to use scroll wheels i d i can't see uh any
uh scenario where you would use a scroll wheel with a button on it
yeah
yeah uh that's a possibility but
but flores
think about a scenario where y where you would use the scroll button for
a volume okay
yeah
wheel
yeah i believe uh if you have uh what we've earlier said um the grip uh places
in in the remote control you have your hand on one place on the remote control so you have to place all the buttons
in a range of your thumb so in that case uh the volume button on the side uh of the remote control would be perfect
yeah yeah you can um i have some information about it uh in the voice recognition you say
a word you can programme words like uh v uh volume up of mute let's say mute
um you programme it you m mute and you g you give um an uh
an action to it that that's really the mute function and uh when you speak
in the the remote control it repeats uh your saying so that's the sample
sensor so if you say mute it says mute again and then it's um
well i believe it's uh
yeah and then uh he he repeats its action what which he believes it is so you say mute he repeats mute and you makes a computer sound mute and then goes to the mute function
yeah well i don't have um i haven't looked for uh for information about it but i
don't think information uh y i don't think you need it on a display especially when when we have
to look at a cost i don't think uh 'cause uh uh all any t v  can uh can uh
view a digit on uh on screen yeah
but what about um the markets
uh wants colourfuls
uh designs so if you use titanium
okay
oh sorry yeah
yeah
and i would think
and they can be implemented with a regular chip
okay but we also uh we already need the regular chip for the sample uh sensor speaker oh evalu
but most infrared uh remote controls don't have to be pointed at all
well if you if you take your hand before it okay it won't work but you can point it just to the other wall yeah
and the regular chip
and and the scroll uh scroll wheels yeah
no think so too
but we already have the scroll wheels the sp uh the speaker uh the speak recognition the rubber
the fancy colours
um no
nothing more
uh but uh can't scroll wheels uh work with one uh one curved case yeah okay sorry yeah
oh sorry yeah
yeah

the project drawing is for the next
yeah right
single curved
but can there be uh wor can they work together or do we have to choose between them 'cause if we have to choose yeah
okay what if not
okay
yeah
grey and yellow
yellow case and grey buttons i think
i believe the
but you have already um you must have a red uh on and off button
and um
well well
well there is just a week ago a keyboard manufacturer would print with and uh

no
a scroll wheel
voice recognition of course
what what did you say
yeah
yeah or you could use plastic buttons
in the rubber
yeah b
but then you just have the the fact that um the drawings on the buttons will disappear eventually
what i said in the in the first uh discussion uh the digit six on the button it will disappear when it's from rubber
it is not uh something uh it's no information i read about it or so but it's just from
no but but uh it
yeah b yeah
yeah that's possible but then you have still the images on the rubber of the case
so still then if you feel uh li uh if you feel your remote control you just rub on the cover so you rub on the painting
yeah
yeah but but the the plus or the minus
you have to draw the
yeah it's on the cover so if you uh
you just move the problem
y uh can you separate these uh these
i do or the s uh the sideways or the the back or the back
i think
yes especially when there are l a few buttons on it you have uh a lot of space to touch so you just have it in your hand completely or or i you play with it
yeah
yeah
regular
use with
for the finishing touch
uh yeah
but um
sebastian has everything
hello hello mister p m 
well that's where the thinking goes on
i think you should punish him you're the p m 

possibilities yeah
yes
so
not at all

okay

just press the okay button it works
how surprising

oh wait uh wait up
uh so do you think um when fruit and vegetables are important for clothing and shoes that they are in remote controls also
not something dull
okay

but can you can you go back to that slide the uh just one slide back no no no
yes
okay and the feel of the material has to be spongy
has it something to do with that uh natural feeling also do you think

okay
it's quite interesting
yes


i don't know the phone but i can imagine it
oh that one yes now i kn uh oh i know i know
yes i i've seen it i've seen it

so so ease of use is important but technology is twice as important and what was even more important
okay so that's the most important thing for our customers
mm hmm but it's it's kind of uh it's kind of o organic so that's very good
yes
slippery
you have to grab it
yes there are there are also remote controls who have uh a little shape underneath where you can put your
fingers in so you can get a really good grip on it so you you don't have to um attain much
pressure to it it's it's a lot easier so m
yes but i'll i'll go into that deeper in my presentation



okay but i'll i'll go into that because there are are some possibilities and some impossibilities um
i had a talk with uh our manufacturing uh division and uh we had a talk about all the different
components um who are in this design uh these are the things we've
looked at and of course i used the web to uh find my information
about the casing we have three different casing possibilities we have the uncurved or flat
case uh that's the most common uh remote con control form uh we're used to
is just a it ju it's just a box i'm sorry i i don't have any pictures of uh of this thing
we have uh a curved one it's uh curved in two dimensions you have to imagine it's a bit like a wave form
so it's uh a little more advanced in its in its shape uh and we have an even more advanced
uh shape which is curved in three dimension i c i think you can compare it a little bit with the uh big grey
image uh you had in your presentation the the big remote control something like that
but it's quite uh advanced and it's
it's quite daring to to use i think um for these casings we have uh different types
of finishing we can use plastic which is uh very slippery and maybe not so nice
but you can give it any colour uh which is the same for rubber but it's not slippery we can use wood and
titanium well um we cannot use the titanium on the double curve cases
and these latex cases there's there's just the plastic ones uh won't allow the use of solar
cells as an energy source source which brings me to the different energy sources
um well we even seem to have uh hand dyn dynamos
for uh powering our uh remote controls you really have to imagine like
winding up your uh i d
it would be very new but it's a kind of a retro uh style i think uh
well this is quite interesting uh there's there's also a kinetic energy supply so um when you're
watching t v  uh or when you're you you have to um make some kind of energy
kinetic energy by shaking the remote or throwing it against the wall whatever you wish
it have it it has to move that's the the sense of it and you can store the energy in the in the thing
mm hmm
it's very funny indeed
mm hmm
indeed
mm hmm yes but you know you know from your own watch your watch uses uh
a minimal con it consumes a minimal amount of energy the the shaking of your body which is almost
uh every activity makes your uh body shake uh it charges it but uh the problem
here is that it it supplies a a very little amount of kinetic energy so i think uh
you have a problem when you're watching a movie and uh you haven't moved the remote uh i remote control in a
in an amount of time and you want t to switch uh the channel or something well m it might not work
so that's something you have to keep in mind
so but maybe maybe there's a possibility com to combine it with m uh traditional batteries so we can save on the batteries and um when there's enough kinet kinetic energy use the kinetic energy and otherwise use the batteries
uh yes it does i'll come to that later and we of course have the traditional uh solar power
which is just uh uh uh uh uh a piece of material on the remote control which
transfers light energy into electricity the user interface controls
um of course we have the push buttons and uh we also have scroll wheels
and these scroll wheels can also be integrated with buttons so it's just like a mouse you can scroll 'em
you can also push it
um uh in the indicators we have the l c d  displays
which means uh you can watch uh in a display w which channel you have chosen
or something like that of the li amount of volume which is uh currently
uh and we also have double scroll buttons which are just two of these things so
we don't really have the the kind of button we had in mind in our uh uh in our last meeting the
the thing with the the round with the four

yes that is possible too yes
mm hmm
well mayb uh well m me neither maybe when you integrate some functions
uh it's do it's done before yes it's quite quite good yes
well it's it well i what he means is there's an button integrated in the scroll wheel there's no scenario where you use uh the button in the scroll wheel you just use the wheel
about mute well yes
okay
yes
well okay well that that that's one possibility okay
well okay it's quite goods
mm hmm yes
hmm but it's done before uh there are many other devices um like uh telephones and our uh radio pocket radios we use this and
well it's it's been done years ago and i don't see it anywhere now so maybe it's not no
hmm
yes but it uses two separate buttons
it doesn't use a well uh something for uh roo here
wi within reach yes you have to
yes
yes
yeah yeah okay okay um we have to know if you want to use
uh these rubber double curved c uh case um you must use these push uh push buttons there's no way
you can integrate l c d  displays there's no way you can integrate scroll wheels because it's all curved there's there are no
uh flat areas where you can incorporate these things so that's a limitation
about um the components uh just the hardware we basically have uh three
types of chips we can use and uh these chips incorporate all the logica and um um
uh hardware that is needed to send uh to send a signal uh we have a simple regular and advanced chip
and there is something like a sample sensor and sample speaker which is a little cryptic uh to me but
i think that's the the voice recognition thing that we are uh thinking about
mm hmm okay
okay so so okay
mm hmm
yeah
okay
mm hmm
okay
okay okay so that's basically the the voice recognition item we were searching for okay this sample sensor
uh requires an regular chip i thought um
no op i'm not very sure no it's not in here if we want to use the l c d  display we really
need the advanced version which is a bit l little bit more costly if we want to use the scroll wheels we
need the regular version and if we don't want to use uh any of these uh more advanced functions we can
keep with the simple uh chip which is a bit cheaper
okay
um no but i think that's something for uh roo here
to think about
i i don't think either
no i don't think you need it
okay okay well my conclusion um unfortunately the market has decided the a little
uh other than i thought i thought um the market would like uh a sort m sort of
titanium casing but they seem to like natural uh stuff so maybe we should think about
uh wood finish um i've chosen the more battery with solar cell
uh solution for the energy it's more reliable it's cheaper so i don't think we
should use the dynamo thing the kinetic thing it it's it's a possibility it's it's more
advanced but i'm i think you should combine it with batteries otherwise it will not too
advanced uh well it's in in in some way it can give us
an advance because you will save on your batteries but
yes and i think it's more robust it's more uh
uh it's more functional
the titanium thing uh
we have to skip it
so i think we should skip the titanium uh stuff and we should uh use wood or something like that
oh okay sorry so it it needs to be rubber
okay
okay spongy materials okay um well um these scroll wheels i think uh they they can be they can be handy so
yes they can but they really need the regular chip you cannot use the sa simple
well i'm not very sure maybe that's an uh a different
i think so if you if you stick with the the simple uh straight forward uh not curve
design i uh it's too dull i don't think c our customers will like it
and um if you uh take the double curved uh then you cannot um you can
only use the rubber buttons and you cannot use the scroll wheels so i think this is the best of two worlds
yes
it's it's uh i uh i can imagine it's very dull to talk to a device w if you have to point to another device it's very unlogical
well the there has to be some pointing at but
all lights get absorbed yeah

yes because the walls they they reflect the infrared light so it has an
it's easier um i suggest we use the the sensor sample uh
the sample sensor and sample speaker
um with a with a regular chip
i think uh it gives us the advantage of
yes yes and uh skip and skip the l c d  part i don't think it it's any uh value added thing so
okay
technology
yes it's not very flashy and new
mm hmm
mm hmm
yes
uh i think our customers will go insane it's it's too much
okay
uh the n the next phase will be um
the um not the what is the next phase f flores
okay
so i
okay
okay
okay okay
yes they can work they cannot work with double curved that's that's problem i'll check it for you
yes
mm hmm
okay
okay so you will be on the bahamas uh
okay so can you uh give us a summary of all uh decisions we've made
i'll do
okay w start with the casing
okay single curved case okay
what about the energy source
i i think they can yes
well uh
it it should be there should be really no problem they can be supplementary that's no problem so
so uh uh just uh the energy source is um the batteries and the solar okay
what about uh the finishing of the case
we have decided we wanted to use the rubber
okay and i think we should use the company colours something like black and red uh black and yellow
grey yellow okay
oh i think it's uh it's not very dull it's quite modern actually don't you think
hmm
okay
okay but uh i'm afraid it's not possible to print a picture on uh the device because uh i agree it would be nice to have have something like that on the device itself but
oh i've read yes
yes but our manufacturing department is not so advanced in its uh techniques they're actually very slow in its techniques
so
so i'm afraid it's not possible
okay so scroll wheel but there will be some additional buttons i guess and th the they should be spongy also because they're they're rubber too
well uh you can use well when you use the buttons they'll they'll be made of rubber too so it has th the spongy uh feel also so i i think that's okay
yes
that's okay
yes the signs
uh i see what you mean
well maybe that's possible because um uh our manufacturing division also offers plastic finishing so maybe they can combine these two
yeah
mm hmm
well i'm i'm not so sure i think it c should be
well i'm not sure i have to ask with manufacturing but i'm i'm not sure that's what you want because our customers specifically
ask for the spongy feel and that's what you get with rubber so if you want the spongy feel you need
uh to make these buttons all all of rubber
i think both
i do
i think
okay
um not quite um what about
uh the chips we use the regular chip okay
and
well no i think that's about it
yes
the only difference between the advanced and the regular version is that the advanced uh version of the chip supports l c d  that's all and we've decided not to use l c d  so
okay
okay
i'll put it online
um
mm don't think so
unless uh things have suddenly change again
uh don't know maybe uh you've got new information like uh last time
okay


oop

no
'kay
hmm
oh
yeah
okay
yeah yeah
my method
well findings uh
ease of use is important but uh innovation is more important and a fancy look
and feel is uh even more important and uh some fashion watchers
have found out that the young target group likes fruit and vegetables
in their uh clothes shoes and furniture and that they want spongy material
probably watch too much sponge bob
uh the older group uh still prefers dark colours simple shapes uh m material but we since we are concentrating on uh
the younger group
'kay
well uh one example given was this so um i assume they just want something colourful not uh specifically uh an apple as a remote control or something
no uh the younger group likes uh more colourful
uh
objects but
which one this
yes
uh well it might but personally i wouldn't like a sponge as a remote control but
maybe soft material or something but not a real sponge
yeah exactly
yeah and like uh the older group likes familiar materials but that doesn't mean we should use wood
so
well this this is an example of what they would like but since we're conten concentrating on uh the younger group
i think we should use soft materials
and uh make it colourful or uh like cell phones exch exchangeable covers
so we could provide
both for the young and the old what they like
i've seen it but
'kay uh that's about it
yes
uh soft material
uh the fancy look and feel
yes apparently
yeah






um

uh well it's obvious obviously new so it might attract uh the young customers
hmm
and yeah the yeah the older people liked wood
no the
yeah the younger people liked soft material
yeah
yeah
standard
nah um n no i don't think so m




hmm
or black and yellow


yeah

uh didn't did we inc uh include the digi digits or uh leave them to the speech recognition 'cause things like uh volume could be uh placed next to the button
there the icons
so you don't touch the icons that much
alright alright thank you for coming to this third meeting of the uh uh design group
um i think we uh made some definite progress at the last one um
and come up with some interesting uh uh w suggestions for our our new remote control
um i'll again very quickly uh just present some notes of that meeting
um the the the problem with existing remote controls we felt was
that they're ugly um and that people are prepared to pay a premium for something better um
they've got lots of buttons on them that uh people don't use and find difficult to learn um and people lose
them and
we we thought that f for our our new uh uh remote control that everybody will
want to rush out and buy um that we're we should look at speech recognition
rather than r rather than buttons and that if we have any buttons they should be very few of them and only for those
functions that are actually identified that that people use that um we want
to go for uh a long lasting battery that we gua we guarantee for the life of the uh uh the product
and a shape that will be instantly recognisable a  um as uh a trendy remote control
and and b  as uh a real reaction product so that w uh when people are
uh happy with that they will they will want to buy uh everything else from us
uh

okay
so again um i'll we'll have the three three presentations from the the the three of you
and then uh we'll we'll make a a final a final uh
decision um and the the decisions that we need to to make today finally are
um what energy source we want to use whether i it is practical to use uh um
a a a long lasting one and uh i i think our discussion was around the fact that uh if we're
gonna go for uh a long lasting power supply then basically it's uh sealed for life
and uh if anybody does manage to run one down we'll we'll give them another one and uh it it'll be uh
you know prominently displayed as part of the th the advertising literature that it's um
um you know for life guaranteed for life
um now the the the internal chip um and uh this is where i need uh
uh kate's expert advice and given that th this has to to go to market as quickly
as possible um d d do we go for a custom designed chip or or
do we buy one off the shelf and and programme it ourselves uh i mean i'm i'm
i'm
n not an expert on these things but presumably there must be loads of 'em already on the market that we can modify but uh
that that's uh that's your area of expertise and then the uh you know the the overall design
of the case uh is is is kendra's field and uh
we we had some discussions last time as as to uh how we might go forward and we'll we'll finalise those
uh da today um and thi this is all linked in with the the the user interface whether we p um
go for voice buttons or or a bit of both uh
and then uh you know f for the next meeting kate will be looking at the the the s the look feel and design kendra the uh
ho how the the user actually uses it and and andrew of course the the product evaluation and uh
kate and kendra will be producing a a model for us to uh to look at
uh so if if we can have the the three presentations again please and uh
um p perhaps you'd like to start uh k
kate
oh i'm sorry oh sorry


okay so how um sorry can you uh just put that one back up again please um
uh d d d okay i mean uh inevitably a b a custom design chip is gonna be more expensive do we do we know uh by how much
and and do we know how long it'll take to uh develop a a custom chip
right okay
right i think we need to make a a decision here uh given that the company wants this on the market
quickly and cheaply that would appear to uh effectively constrain us to an existing
chip and thus therefore conventional button technology
um uh now before we go round everybody else does anybody um
h have any have anyti ha anything to say about that
cause uh i must say i find it slightly surprising given that you know mobile phones incorporate voice activated dialling so uh um i mean i d d for slightly different well no i mean it's if you you
speak somebody's name and it'll dial the number for you so uh bu i mean the this this information is from is this is the internal company information is it
so uh

yeah mm true again but if it's without any without any uh p price informations that's uh difficult to uh
uh decide
yeah that's that's right it's like it's it's you can't 'cause mobile phones are expensive you can't say it's the voice recognition bit that is but we don't know um
i mean uh
i su i i mean if given that the um the technology is not well developed and and given that it's it's never been done before um th th the double risk
uh perhaps we ought to uh stick to uh to buttons since the last thing we want to do is present a product that doesn't work um
thoughts
i mean do w do we think that the voice technology is fundamental to the project
i mean i think we

mm
yeah i i i i i think that's uh
yeah yeah
mm right okay

yeah it should be
right okay so
fine okay i it will have voice recognition um uh if if that means uh
if that means we can't afford buttons but i mean b b second question
do we need the five buttons for channel change up down volume up down and on off
just as a a backup or just so that people can uh j j just sit there pressing buttons
right
okay sorry d did you want to say anything no okay shall we move rapidly on to uh kendra uh um ra rapidly move the cable over
mm
oh good
mm yeah it'll get there yep
mm hmm
mm yeah
uh huh
alright
mm hmm
mm yeah
sorry y y yeah if i can interrupt you well d p 'kay do you wanna say anything about um slide controls i mean i think the reason everybody uses pushbuttons is that they're they're si simple cheap and reliable
okay fair enough fine
yeah
good good
yeah
so three three there's three buttons on a slider three buttons channel up channel up down and
uh huh
okay um
mm hmm
this one on the one side and one yeah okay
yeah
yeah
yeah or yeah uh th th the i mean thi this is what the we have to come up with is the the actual shape that people can ins instantly pick it up and and know know uh know what it's going to do
okay so we we're looking at sliders for both a uh volume and channel change
of one sort just for the volume uh
fingers yeah i mean it's it's
it yeah i mean it it it seems to me that uh it uh it al also has the advantage that it it the two are clearly different
um that there's no no possibility of uh confusing the two so okay
right so uh that's sorry is that that all you want to say at the mo okay fine
mm right
right
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm
well i i mean i th i think that what we're suggesting ought to address all three of those
okay
uh huh
mm i hadn't thought of that that's different certainly
what
yeah

uh
uh
also means you can drop it without damaging it
i i mean it its uh i that's an interesting idea it's like the old swatch watch where uh
um on only batteries ever got changed in those 'cause people just bought a new one when it went out of fashion but it's just never been
seen as a a fashion item before um that's yes if if
if they're made in sufficient quantity
w i mean we we can uh uh b but i mean my feeling is that current power sources are such that for relatively
little cost you can make it last you know a long time um but if we also make it cheap
enough that people either change the cover every year or even buy a new one every year then it it's it's even better
s
yeah yeah i n i know the only p i mean the the the the immediate thing that comes to mind with that is that it it it y you've then
got the connection and you've immediately got a sort of unreliability whereas the advantage of having it
plumbed in is that that the whole thing is all you know completely soldered together and it it it you know total
reliability but i mean i d i i uh
i know what you're saying and uh understand where you're coming from
i th i s i think if we're gonna go down that route then we're talking about uh even if it costs slightly more than that um
just building the whole thing in one then having getting cheaper production costs um and
you know giving people the option of buying a new uh a a complete new thing the advantage of a replaceable cover
is that even if they don't it doesn't have a cover on at all it will still work um totally
um then if you know if people lose the cover i mean they they might be well inclined to go out and spend
however many euros on a on a new one um rather than a a complete new
re remote
yeah i mean it is it's up to it's up to
yeah it's it's up to our marketing people to to ma to ma turn it into a a fashion item um and you know as as external fashions change then we get new new covers on the market and you know readily available and um
that's that's right yeah yeah
so uh i so uh okay um right sorry um we hadn't finished your
it's the sort of thing that we want people to have prominent dis displayed on their um coffee table to say this says something about me
um this is fashionable i you know i'm i'm i'm with it i'm up to date and
you know th the the design that i've got and and it could be a a home made design
um you know this says this is not just a a television remote control this is you know a fashion accessory
um
so i mean the the the basic shape i is is what we uh i mean given that we've got you know one one
on off button presumably two buttons for uh channel change and one slider
and basically nothing else um w we need to decide on the just the basic
shape of the thing
and know whether we go down the fruit and veg route and i don't suggest we make it look like a banana but um
know sort of the the organic you know curved look you know t to deliberately get away from
the uh um uh you know the the the the square look of most
um current uh remotes and you know whether whether the you know the the fixed part
of it is the corporate yellow um
mm or uh 'cause there's certainly you know the the corporate logo needs to be prominently uh displayed so that people s th looked at it and say right that's a real reaction remote control i want one of those
yeah uh the the uh or or b
yeah i'd i'd um yeah uh no i d i i agree i mean we're we're we're simply it's simply required to incorporate the the the the corporate logo prominently um
well th this is this is the whole point yes you know i'm i've got a a real reaction uh remote
control to go with my real reaction coffee maker or or whatever and uh then people
you know people demand more real reaction stuff
yeah
yeah yeah
i mean i've uh yeah
oh no that well there's the sim my my idea was something a b probably you know a bit fatter than this but sort of tha that sorta shape so that you can just sort of ho hold it
w it i mean well it's sort of it's it's sort of uh a a mouse but held you know so it's you sorta hold it in your hand like that i with you know and fiddling with the buttons
okay yeah yeah
it's a very good point
i think we d i think we decided that w we're actually going down both routes that um the we n we need the the manual controls and that they should be of that form but that uh yeah
then you just bring it up to your mouth and just speak to it yeah yeah
i th i th honest uh my personal view is that if it's not there people wouldn't use it anyway um
it's cer it's certainly possible i mean but they we we're going beyond w w given the state of the technology we want something that we kno we know will will work um
uh
yeah
if we we're i mean i'm getting a clear message that we think that we should have those facilities available
uh uh uh
okay if we if we're going down that route then
we need some sort of display do we need some sort of display we actually use the television okay okay okay okay
yep

mm yeah okay we got five minutes to go in this meeting so
um i d i think we've actually very conveniently just uh come to
uh a good point to s to sum up um
so um b b kate and kendra now go away and
uh pa play play with a bit of plasticine or play dough whatever it is on the other side of the atlantic um
and actually put what we've discussed into something uh i was gonna
say concrete but that's a slightly inappropriate word um to something that we can we can see
and um andrew n can go away and th th think about how we can uh actually
market this as a concept and not j not just a uh um a a simple remote control
yeah certainly of course
i think i think we decided that we're gonna for for simplicity of you know manufacturing
and uh maintenance that we will go for a a long term battery source um
i you know on the basis that um that you know if we're going for making it a fashion statement then
uh people are more likely to change it anyway uh before i it runs out and um
make an assumption that we we can aim for a battery that will last most people for uh
we'll say at least five five ten years and that we'll w we will guarantee it for for five years
um
we're having a
a custom chip but given the the we've cut the functions down um
that will hopefully not be too problematic but given that um technol
technological innovation is important then we need to i'll say it again technologically
innovate
um and uh we we know we must resist any efforts to uh to try and water that down um
i i interchangeable case seems to be um um important to the concept
um it it should be cheap you know if if we avoid any you know electrical connections and
uh i you know i if we can come up with some way of of allowing people to actually personalise it uh
to whatever they want then uh i mean uh uh this is totally new we d we don't know whether
that to what extent people do it or not but if they've at least got a a good selection of um covers that
they can use anyway and uh and if if we can keep them you know rolling then uh you know so they
can get them in the supermarket when they go down to um a any of the famous supermarkets
i won't mention any mention any names um it's uh it's good for the supermarket and it's good for
us and it hopefully makes them feel better
um the that i mean that's no because we've got so few buttons that it that actually makes that redundant
yeah yeah and the you know that that solves one of the problems of b of battery life 'cause that would well that would clobber the battery life so no i mean given the nature of the buttons we're having it's actually uh uh unnecessary i think
as uh as wide cer certainly wider angle than than current so that if you're
holding it you know anyway like you're likely to and uh it's uh
you know i i it will work most of the time um
not like my my mum who points it at the ceiling and wonders why the th th the television doesn't work
um yeah i mean i d i th i sorta envisaged that if if this was the the thing then sort of the the whole of the top would be the uh the infrared uh
um so
yeah 'cause i mean the r reality is people are they're gonna be looking at the television whilst they're using it the chances
are so if if they're holding it anyway the they're reasonably likely to be holding it to use it then uh
then that that's the sort of coverage that we want
um okay d we're all clear where we go from here
okay so thank you very much indeed and i'll s see you all again in thirty minutes




okay um
um p there we go
'kay i'll just be talking about the components design and
okay basically i just uh looked at what exactly do remotes do uh basically they wait for you to press a key or give a voice command
and then this is translated uh into uh light signals which are then seen by the t v 
uh the materials we're gonna need to look at uh the two big ones are the integrated circuit chip and the battery
and the in integrated circuit chip uh works in conjunction with a a diode transistor or resonator uh
two more resistors and a capacitor and the battery works in conjunction with a resistor and a capacitor
um
uh basically what happens is you'll press a number or give a voice command and this creates a a connection within the the remote
that allows the chip the chip then senses this connection and produces a signal in a morse code format
this signal's sent to the transistor which amplifies it and then sends it on to the light emitting diode and
uh which is then trai changed into a infrared light which is sent to the t v  and sort of seen by
the t v  and which uh changes the channels
um oh uh cool
uh so as for how we should end up uh using this in our remote uh t couple of main questions are the buttons uh y the fewer buttons you have i guess the fewer internal connections and internal codes you're gonna need um
however uh to n not have buttons or to use a voice commands instead of buttons might make these connections
more difficult and uh raise the production cost that's something we should think about also we have to work within the company constraints and
the company has informed me via email that uh they're experts at pushbuttons and that seems to be the most uh
cost effective way of producing it
um also with battery connections the company has some limits on the batteries we can use so i was thinking perhaps a combination
of solar cells with a back up basic battery and somehow between the combination of that two we might be able to come
up with something that uh will last the the lifetime or the five to ten years and we could still
keep that original idea
um we also need to look at the chips uh v custom designed versus off the shelf and the custom designed
will give us much more flexibility and enable us to incorporate the voice function that we all uh seem to have agreed upon
um however that's gonna cost more but uh the off the shelf is gonna be uh cheaper and it's gonna be allow us to produce it quicker and get
out there faster but it's going to be less flexible with the features especially things like uh voice activation which haven't really
been used much on remotes so there's not really chips out there that would be easy to uh to convert so if we were
uh definitely gonna go with the the voice option we'd probably have to design um our own chip
and that pretty much sums it up
mm oh yep sorry yep
mm
um i don't actually have any price information no
um it a lot longer than an off the shelf chip oh w yeah we did the the problem is the the the voice
technology is not really highly developed it's sort of still still in an ex experimental form uh so it
would uh it's hard to predict the time
mm
w just to to incorporate the voice activation in it is is sorta the trick once you've got the whole voice chip in there then it's pretty much the the world the the sky is your limit but to actually the the big step is to actually get the voice activation chips in there and working
uh bits of it yeah
yes as well

mm
uh it's fundament well i mean i guess it it's something we've discussed uh since the the sort of the beginning so i th i think in
in our in our minds it's it's fundamental but i don't know that the uh the upper echelons of the company would necessarily
agree with that so i think you have to

hm

mm
mm mm
mm
no that sounds good mm
mm cool

um
yeah i i would say we do yeah
uh nope that was it that was it okay
yeah it's thinking about it
yeah

mm
uh
uh i think they're they're about the same cost really i i mean i think it's just sort of the the there's a lot of slide buttons out there i think it's pretty much the same sort of connection mm yeah
mm

mm
ye yeah 'cause i've definitely picked up remotes and like meant to change the channel and turn the volume or vice versa so it'd be kinda good to have them be feel completely different you'd know what you were fiddling with
yeah
mm
mm
yeah 'cause if yeah in that kinda position the fingers would be better for pressing and the that for rolling just the way it would
mm yeah yeah yeah



mm


mm
mm hmm
well that can kinda tie into our changing uh face things like we could have the fruit and vegetable theme this year and uh whatever happens next year we can have the face plates yeah
yeah yeah
mm yeah that weird i dunno what that is but yeah
mm
uh yeah it's good as well mm hmm
mm
mm
i
i think it's easier sometimes to have them buy changeable covers for it than to buy a whole new one because you don't feel like you're investing in a whole new product
yeah
mm
yeah
mm
mm
oh yeah i like that that all c also kind of encourages 'em to buy new covers and yeah
um
uh yeah
mm
mm hmm
mm
mm
well that that's just it with the covers you're sort of tricking 'em into continuing to spend their money on our products without making 'em feel like they're being ripped off having to buy a new product so yeah
yeah
mm
mm yeah
mm
and that's the sort of thing once you get the mould set you can just whip out different colours different pictures very very quickly yeah yeah exactly exactly
yeah
mm mm hmm
yeah
mm

mm
i dunno that we should make the whole thing yellow i kinda thought with a you'd have like a yellow circle with the r r  in it somewhere on it but i'd yellow seems a bit of a strong colour to make the ent like the thing no but i mean just like white or grey or black or some sort of blah colour yeah yeah
yeah
mm


mm hmm
mm yeah
mm
yeah
yeah you'd want it narrower than a mouse though 'cause it a mouse you're kinda just resting on it you want something you can definitely grip so maybe it'd be
yeah yeah
yeah
yeah and fiddle around with it and press it
maybe almost like a hairbrush like you could get the about the width of that end of the pen and then it widens up top and you can fiddle an yeah
yeah yeah yeah
mm
yeah cool
yeah
yeah
yeah yeah
but do you know this shape also kind of les lend itself to to voice 'cause if you're you're holding it and you're fiddling but you can also bring it up like that and it's microphone esque yeah yeah
mm
bu
mm
well you can still i incorporate the voice with with less buttons i mean uh if the power button was also somehow like a menu button
you could press that and or do voice commands and either volume thing could also be to scroll through
other options like y and you could scroll through brightness and and sc and then you can you can minimise the buttons and still have
those you know brightness and tint and stuff
yeah
yeah
but the television would be the display that things like that usually c pop up on a televi like you hit menu and menu will come up on television and have like tint brightness and you'd use the scroll scroll through it yeah
yeah yeah that's true
i never understood how that worked though but yeah
yeah mm
mm oka yeah
yeah
cool
play with play dough


mm
yeah


mm
mm

mm does actually yeah yeah
mm different to feel yeah yeah
mm hmm yep yeah mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah
mm yeah

mm hmm
yeah mm
mm
yep sounds good
'kay
'kay


i
i just have a question about that um does it make a difference if there are just a few commands for example
if you um can pre programme in like numbers one through ten and pre programme say
you know nine channels and then just use the voice recognition to say channel one and then you've programmed in
say b b c  four as your channel one as your favourite it's like to have a certain number of favourites um
and that w
okay then it doesn't matter okay
okay
yeah
of course mobile phones do tend to be more expensive you know hundred and fifty pounds or something
as opposed to the twenty euros twenty five euros
yeah
yeah
well another thought i oh sorry go ahead
oh yeah

okay
well i kinda think if we're gonna have the voice recognition for part of it then maybe we should have it for the whole thing
and we've been talking about it the whole time anyway i'm i'm incli kinda inclined to say that we should just go for it
yeah
okay
yeah
i think so
okay
let's see
oh
yes
is it gonna work
okay okay so i did some research on the internet
and um what you know the interf user interface are just aspects that are seen by users
um commands and mechanisms for the operation and there're just kind of a variety of choices um
findings so a lot of times they tend to look cluttered and these were just a couple examples of
um different kinds that are a little bit more unusual there're some special ones available like this one right here which is
marketed towards children um different designs and one of the things that n we need to watch out for is a v 
in volume because people some
bring a little picture of what i thought ours could look like so just kind of minimise the clutter avoid too many
buttons and also um one of the things that people have used is a slide button like you have on a mouse
that possibly we could use that on the sides for volume for example have the slide button on the side and then you can pre programme
the channels the voice recognition and then the voice response sample locator
just because i n for example if i'm using a mouse i like to be able to slide it up and down so i thought it might be good for volume to just be able to kind of roll it and then have the up and down and then the this is my great little drawing
y yes yes

yeah
the only advantage i was thinking of to having the buttons like the buttons on one side for the channel and then the slider is that if you're just holding in your hand and you pick it up it's easy to n s know okay this is just the volume and this is the channel
yeah
that was
yeah
um well i was thinking kind of just for the volume but what what do you guys think we could

yeah yeah
b
yeah
yeah
i'm just gonna pass this along
yes
yeah
yeah
oh
yeah
yeah like the kind you get on like hand weights you know that kind of spongy yeah
yeah that's true
yeah

wh
what if we included the batteries in the cover
so um like
yeah so can i see that thing just this as examples
so f
yeah i guess that's
true
yeah that's true
yeah yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah just another five euro to get
right
yeah
yeah like they have for mobile phones that are just fruits and animal prints and colours yeah okay

yeah like an
yeah
yeah
well n

well i was sort of mm kinda picturing like maybe um a shape that's almost like a mouse
so that you know when they hold it it's because a mouse is pretty comfortable to hold in your hand um maybe we could
make it a slightly different shape so they could hold on to it but that way they can have the volume on the side and then the channel buttons
and
have the power wherever somewhere
i mean that was just an idea that i had
yeah
yeah maybe kind of a c
yeah sort of a combination
yeah
yeah so yeah kind of maybe maybe a little wider than this 'cause this is pretty comfortable to hold and then if you had
yeah then wider up here and then it would have a l uh wider thing to uh have the light
the infrared light at the t v  and just kinda change channels and adjust the volume and
the power could be wherever up up the top or something what do you guys think about
that
oh yeah
it is a very good point
yeah
yeah
yeah and just say
yeah i suppose i sup
so i guess we could have a menu button as well we could have the channels and the power and then a menu button and then the volume so have four buttons and the volume instead of three buttons and the volume
yeah that's on the t v  yeah
yeah and then y
yeah press that is t yeah that might work yeah it's like um yeah it's like the mouse where you just kinda click it you just press it
yeah and you could just click that to so if you had like the menu then you could scroll through and then click it to select
you know what i mean
okay

yeah

yeah i think so too yeah and especially for making them so like different and
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
like this or like this


yeah kinda like this whole
so you could use like this and it would go
yeah
yeah
yep
okay
also lots of mobile phones have got a lot of technology in them not just that so
would
oh i was just gonna say mayb maybe it sh
like um
maybe we can like cut corners somewhere else to bring in over cost
uh yeah it's the second most important aspect to users that the device should be technologically innovative
from uh my presentation show so uh technologically innovative
mm
well if you g if you if you got a channel up down we can have a slider in that as well because if it if you no if you notice on the thing
it it kind of like has got kind of if you you know it s kind of like sticks if you know what i mean
up like one unit if you see what i mean so it kinda goes up one then y like you can keep rolling it up but it's like like like like a cog
or something so you kinda take it up one at a time
d
oh
uh you could you could as l as like a mouse you could
yeah like the shape of it almost like a mouse with a
dep
i dunno if it depending on the final shape of it 'cause you could have like i dunno it looks like you can c control the volume with your thumb and then you could control the buttons with your fingers
oh yeah yeah


here we go uh yeah this is my report on trend watching the
data's come off internet uh from executive summary for us on the top three
things wanted by the consumer and we got reports from paris milan on new fashions
and uh
the most important aspect is the l the look it has to look fancy look and feel
uh instead of the current functional look and feel this is a st well i was gonna say yeah twice as important
as the second aspect which is the technologically innov innovative um side of it
so uh and the third being easy to use is probably a given we have to try and incorporate
so uh
uh exactly yeah
i s that out of sequence uh yeah sorry uh yeah and uh from the fashion watchers from milan and paris have said fruit and vegetables are an important theme for clothes and furniture and shoes et cetera uh sorry clothes shoes and furniture
and uh
a spongy material to be used on the on the outside
yeah but uh i was gonna say um yeah fruit and vegetables uh important to this year um important to furniture i'm just gonna say
uh f like it's in if if fashion if we're going for the it looks fancy then fashion is obviously the line we gotta be going through but fashions do don't last very long
mm
yeah
yeah we can have a sp like a spongy skin on it and then we can just whip that off and
a kind of yeah oh
yeah that's c cool
um you have we could
if we could save depending on the cost of the product itself you know could we have uh a cheaper b cheaper power source and then just have it annually renewed
instead of having a ten year guarantee with interchangeable covers could just buy a new one every year a new one when new fashions come out
yeah
mm hmm
or well but like uh like more than just the battery like a complete different like
you've only got like you know like th uh this bit's the bit you keep and this is the expensive bit this is like the chip and
this is the microphone and then this is the power source and the bit everyone sees and then
yeah you probably are right
um oh don't worry it's all said i was just gonna say uh yeah are we gonna make this as part of like like uh a part of the f like it it the fashions apply to furniture so are we gonna make this part of the furniture
yeah this is fashionable with

oh yeah
and make that a fashion symbol as well

yeah that sounds
um i'm just i'm suddenly realising that yeah we're discussing how much how good it's gonna be to change channels t we still can just tell it to i mean are we are we starting to get away from the the voice functionality of it

yeah maybe we cou like w like we're leaving out the buttons for the the f less frequently used stuff but maybe we could incorporate that into the voice
mm i suppose but t there is the off chance that you know th the brightness is wrong on your t v  or the contrast needs changing
hmm yeah
yeah that's a good idea
yeah

well i mean on a onto like a mouse the ru the scrolling button is actually a button as well you could press it you could press that and have it as a menu button
uh yeah
hmm
uh can i just get some things clear just for my sake our energy source is gonna be
long term
cool uh

and we're having a custom chip

and interchangeable case
mm mm hmm

and uh are we gonna have it il being illuminated from inside onto the buttons or
cool
are we having it that it's any angle or is it just
as wide as possible
mm hmm
so hello everyone we're here to have a kick off meeting for the design
of a f for the beginning of new project um uh remote control for
the design for a new remote control i'm the project manager christa pavlov
and okay let's begin

so
i'm first going to do an opening then we get used
to one anothers and we speak about this tool we're going
to design and try to make a project plan
some discussion and then we talk of uh the next meeting
so um we want to to do a new remote control it has to be original trendy and user friendly
um i think the important points we have to t talk about are uh it's functional design it's conceptual design and desail detailed design
and for that we're going um all to work individually and then have meeting during the whole day
um so let's try the whiteboard um so any of you who want to go


wow


a rabbit
a rabbit

you want to go

a human ah


mm i think you're supposed to yeah
hmm


is that a worm or

uh yeah christa pavlov mm
smiling fish
mm hmm
yeah next let's talk about money


so
yeah mm that's the price we want to that's the aim for the price for the remote control we aim to do this profit

yeah mm hmm

mm for a production cost of mm twelve fifty euros maximum
'kay
so any of you have experience in remote controls

that

so that could be a great um application remote controls children proof mm mm hmm
okay

so they have to be waterproof maybe 'cause they eat she ate it
mm hmm

mm hmm
colourful yeah mm
no that's a good idea
mm mm mm
yeah
no because you think why not
mm hmm
good idea
small also don't you think
no uh not too much buttons or mm
mm hmm
yeah that's

okay
so i think there's
so you you think it's better if small
than bigger
no not too small yeah
hmm
okay
mm
mm hmm
mm so some kind of idea uh with um um cellular phone with a a screen that will tell you what no
okay
and too expensive
mm
mm mm
mm hmm mm mm mm
so adaptable yeah something yeah
three option

um
mm hmm maybe if it's more if there is a software inside that ask you three
hmm if it if we want a r universal remote control that we sa like we say before it may
may need more than three mm three button three mm possibilities ye yeah
mm

yeah i change channel like this m uh i want to go to twenty five and then to ten uh huh mm yeah
also we can be here yeah that would be cool
mm yeah



mm mm
okay so i think we have full of idea
um we're going to meet again in thirty minutes and uh i want you to mm
work on these ideas and try to make a
uh the ones make um to decide what what are the ones important and what are the one that we don't want
and um m maybe more in the technical parts what uh do we want to do
um
so um your personal coach will send you some instruction for for this thirty minutes
mm
mm hmm
mm okay
so
i think that's all
yeah
see you in thirty minutes
oops
yeah for favourite animals it's gonna be not my favourite one but the one i can draw and it's gonna be you'll try to guess
no
yes that's a rabbit that's my favourite one
that's it
hmm
wow
no
wow that's cobra
no it just small cobra yeah
it's co c quite recognisable
christa christa
hmm
okay

just tr try to guess who is a user interface designer according to the drawings okay
on the international market
wow
mm to eat
children proof
hmm
okay unbreakable
uh huh
colourful that's not practical
no
but how gonna okay just uh but it's uh monochrome it's n it's not like
otherwise you will never find it
cool
ch
yeah but without any extremes like n not of this size not too large okay
yeah like a palm sized
just to hold it
no no screens it's too complex
and n maybe not too expensive well it's not my problem but well okay but no screens on remote controls
mm hmm
mm hmm mm hmm
adaptable alright good so how many actions do we need to implement in it
on off
i mean if it's less than three uh then we can make it uh like a
like three mental states yeah you know what i mean we can just make it uh
controlled by a brain huh
mm hmm
sh sure sure
but for standard actions you usually what do you do you change channels you adjust volume and nothing else
mm hmm you do this
i usually just change channels
uh huh go back button is good i once had it
mm hmm
history
market expert

okay
thank you everybody


no

rabbit


you wa



is the white okay
i guess you can
yeah uh not really small cobra


chris
mm
smile fish
yeah

yeah you're
hmm

yeah we're to sell two million then
mm yeah




yeah pret

yeah
ah
yeah we have some child lock or something yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah it's always black or yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah even we can change colours no like the uh like the phones and these things we c yeah at least for children like one colour and
and it should be really small and
huh not so big like yeah
yeah not too much buttons and
uh
yeah

yeah colour size sh
yeah maybe at least n not bigger than this i guess
yeah yeah at least it should hold in your hand n properly like
yeah
uh maybe we can change the colours that at least the frame mm s so then it depends you are to
mm i mean you c you can easily remove the frame
yeah yeah
yeah
yeah
mm too expensive yeah
ye yeah
hmm
i mean it it's like it's like two types no people are right handed or left handed so y because
i am left handed i use like this say if you're right handed you use like this or so tha your
switch on and off should be on yeah
mm huh
maybe i think even we can keep two switches and then we can uh only make one working
we can adapt only one switch suppose here like we can make two switches and if i'm left hander i use this switch to follow the main operations
two

yeah
yeah



mm yeah
yeah
mm
yeah
yeah

yeah but they keep generally their t slash slash uh this thing and then the dash dash and then you can put yeah you can only have one bit
dash
yeah you can yeah
yeah
yeah yeah the previous button is
uh okay
oh uh
uh
yeah



yeah yeah what the which channels the viewer
marketing yeah
thank you



wow
wow
complex
huh
a cat
no darn
uh
a what
a r a rabbit oh oh yeah where is the carrot okay mm hmm
i am not very good at uh this kind of stuff my favourite animal is

guess a human yay it's a very complex animal
and um yeah characteristics of this this animal is dangerous
ah a kind of uh snake cobra exactly
uh huh

what about you uh christa
a fish
a smiling fish mm hmm so w whiteboard is working good next
yeah well
not me
so twenty five euro for a remote control
okay
'tis big number
mm hmm
uh yes we have plenty at home in fact my daughter likes
l remote controls to eat yeah mainly and to break
mm hmm yeah ye ye yeah
so she likes uh buttons which make click so it has to click
it has to be uh wha baby proof yeah but mainly
it has to be very robust because even if she's not very tall she's uh high
enough so that uh when she throw it away it's uh
so it has to be very robust
unbreakable yeah
mm hmm
and uh
it has to be nice looking
colourful maybe
colourful because uh nobody has colourful remote control they're always black yeah but this one could be i dunno purple or b
yeah yeah
one colour
yeah yeah
oh like the phones yeah it could change colours yeah
yeah
good
should it be y you know these uh remote controls where um they are what they call a universal ret remote
control so y you can decide that now it's the remote control for the television then it's the remote control for the
the sound system or for your refrigerator whatever i
dunno if it's
or if we should have a targeted re remote control
so colour robustness easy to use size yeah size matters yeah
mm

yeah
mm
but uh what would be different from this from the others i dunno if
yeah at least the colour would be different
i think one thing important for instance in this remote control if you remember when people use it they're they never find a good button in the right place
for some reason they they they click the off button when they want to use the
so there's a problem in the design of that kind of remote control somehow i dunno
too expensive for twelve euro
ah
mm hmm i thought it could be only a screen which would change depending on uh uh the use or even the user
so ma i prefer to have the off button at the top right so i would have my own design of the remote control because it's in fact just a a full touch screen remote control if you if you like
i don't know if it makes sense but
yeah for instance mm
mm
maybe if if it's possible yeah

yeah
three buttons you mean
ah

mm hmm yeah sure
yeah more than three actions that you may want to do at a given time
yeah but for instance when you change channels you can have you can just go to the next one or go to channel twenty five
and that's already more complex to go to channel twenty five
uh no because i'm only using three or four channels but
and then back to the one i was before so there's whichever it was
yeah uh uh we had that in in other countries yeah e even the history so you could like uh undo previous of the previous
then you can watch what your ah you could also record your record your
sequence of actions that becomes more complex but you could look at what uh the other people
have used there or remote controls yeah maybe
it's a
okay
so what does m e  means m e  the user requirements or that's uh that's for us
uh that's me oh of course yeah the user requirement specifications uh huh yeah
okay i'll think of that
so
meeting's over great
thank you
hi i'm david and i'm supposed to be an industrial designer
um i just got the project announcement about what the project is designing a remote control that's about it didn't get anything else did you get the same thing


cool
there's too much gear

okay
can't draw
um
yeah
um well anyway i don't know it's just the first animal i can think off the top of my head um yes big reason is 'cause i'm allergic to most animals allergic to animal fur so um fish was a natural choice
um yeah and i kind of like whales they come in and go eat everything in sight
and they're quite harmless and mild and interesting
tail's a bit big i think



it's an after dinner dog then

hmm
it does make sense from maybe the design point of view 'cause you have more complicated characters like european languages then you need more buttons
so possibly
hmm
yeah
and you keep losing them
finding them is really a pain you know i mean it's usually quite small or when you want it right it slipped behind the couch or it's kicked under the table
you know
yep
mm hmm
i think one factor would be production cost
because there's a cap there so um depends on how much you can cram into that price um
i think that that's the main factor
cool
okay
right
um well this is the kick off meeting for our our project um
and um this is just what we're gonna be doing over the next twenty five minutes um
so first of all just to kind of make sure that we all know each other i'm laura and i'm the project manager do
you want to introduce yourself again
okay
great okay um so we're designing a new remote control and um oh i have to record who's here actually so that's david andrew and craig isn't it
and you all arrived on time
um yeah so des uh design a new remote control um as you can see it's supposed to be original trendy and
user friendly um so that's kind of our our brief as it were um
and so there are three different stages to the design um i'm not really sure what what you guys
have already received um in your emails what did you get
mm hmm
is that what everybody got okay um so we're gonna have like individual work
and then a meeting about it and repeat that process three times um
and at this point we get try out the whiteboard over there um so uh
you get to draw your favourite animal and sum up your favourite characteristics of it so who would like to go first
very good
mm hmm

yeah yeah
right lovely

right
you can take as long over this as you like because we haven't got an awful lot to discuss ok oh we do we do don't feel like you're in a rush anyway
ach why not we might have to get you up again then
i don't know what mine is i'm gonna have to think on the spot now

is that a whale
ah
okay god i still don't know what i'm gonna write about um
i was gonna choose a dog as well but i'll just draw a different kind of dog m my favourite animal is my own dog at home um
that doesn't really look like him actually
he looks more like a pig actually
ah well
do you oh that's very good of you

uh
um he's a mixture of uh various things um and what do i like
about him um that's just to suggest that his tail wags um he's very friendly and
cheery and always pleased to see you and very kind of affectionate and um
uh and he's quite quite wee as well so you know he can doesn't take up too much space um
and uh and he does a funny thing where he chases his tail as well which is quite amusing so
it is i think it is he only does it after he's had his dinner and um he'll just all of a sudden just get up and start chasing his tail 'round the living room
yeah so uh
yeah maybe
maybe right um where did you find this just down here yeah
okay
um what are we doing next uh um
okay uh we now need to discuss the project finance um
so according to the brief um we're gonna be selling this remote control for twenty five euro um and we're
aiming to make fifty million euro um so we're gonna be selling this
on an international scale and uh we don't want it to cost any more than uh twelve
fifty euros so fifty percent of the selling price
sure
all together
um i dunno i imagine that's a good question
i imagine it probably is our sale actually because it's probably up to the
the um the retailer to uh sell it for whatever price they want um
but i i don't know i mean do you think the fact that it's going to be sold internationally will have a bearing on how we design it at all
think it will um
hmm
oh yeah regions and stuff yeah yeah okay
yeah well for a remote control do you think that will be i suppose it's depends on how complicated our remote control is
yeah yeah okay
what just like in terms of like the wealth of the country like how much money people have to spend on things like
aye i see what you mean yeah
marketing good marketing thoughts oh gosh i should be writing all this down um
mm
yeah
yeah yeah like how much does you know a remote control cost
well twenty five euro i mean that's um
that's about like eighteen pounds or something isn't it or no is it as much as that sixteen seventeen eighteen pounds
um i dunno i've never bought a remote control so i don't know how how good a remote control that would get you um
but yeah i suppose it has to look kind of cool and gimmicky
um right okay
let me just scoot on ahead here okay um well d does anybody have anything to add to uh to the finance issue at all
thin
no actually that would be useful though wouldn't it if you knew like what your money would get you now
mm hmm
yeah yeah
oh
five minutes to end of meeting oh okay we're a bit behind
yeah
right so do you think that should be like a main design aim of our remote control d you know do your your satellite and your regular telly and your v c r  and everything
mm hmm
yeah
or even like you know notes about um what you wanna watch like you might put in there oh i want to watch such and such and look a oh that's a good idea so extra functionalities
mm hmm
hmm
um okay uh i'd wel we're gonna have to wrap up pretty quickly in the next couple of minutes
um i'll just check we've nothing else okay um so anything else anybody wants to add about
what they don't like about remote controls they've used what they would really like to be part of this new one
at all
you keep losing them okay
yeah w you get those ones where you can if you like whistle or make a really high pitched noise they beep there i mean is that something we'd want to include do you think
dunno okay maybe

my goodness
still feels quite primitive
maybe like a touch screen or something
okay
uh huh okay well i guess that's up to our industrial designer
it looks better
yeah
okay
okay
right well um so just to wrap up the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes so that's about um
about ten to twelve by my watch um so inbetween now and then um
as the industrial designer you're gonna be working on you know the actual working design of it so y you know what you're doing there
um for user interface technical functions i guess that's you know like what we've been talking
about what it'll actually do um and uh marketing executive
you'll be just thinking about what it actually what you know what requirements it has to has to fulfil and you'll all get instructions emailed to you i guess
um
yeah so it's th the functional design stage is next i guess

and uh
and that's the end of the meeting
so i got that little message a lot sooner than i thought i would so
mm hmm
uh huh yeah
th
okay well just very quickly 'cause this we're supposed to finish now um i guess that's up to us i mean you probably want some kind of unique selling point of it so um you know
yeah
mm hmm
yeah
okay right okay we'll that's that's the end of the meeting then um
so uh
thank you all for coming
um i'm craig and i'm user interface
yeah

well my favourite animal would be a monkey

then they're small cute and furry and uh when planet of the apes becomes real i'm gonna be up there with them









yeah
i know um
my parents went out and bought um remote controls because um they got fed up of having four or five different remote controls for each things the house so um for them it was just how many devices control
uh
mm hmm
great
and i'm andrew and i'm uh our marketing
expert
mm hmm
mm hmm yeah that's that's it
yeah
i will go that's fine
alright so
this one here right
okay very nice alright my favourite animal
is like


a beagle
um charac favourite characteristics of it is that right uh right well basically
um high priority for any animal for me is that they be willing to take a lot of
physical affection from their family and yeah
that they have lots of personality and uh be fit and in robust good health
so this is blue blue beagle my family's beagle


i coulda told you a whole lot more about beagles boy let me tell you
impressionist

alright
mm
superb sketch by the way

yep
i see a dog in there yep

now i see a rooster
what kind is it


is he aware that th it's his own cha tail he's chasing

hmm
probably when he was little he got lots of attention for doing it and has forever been conditioned

'kay
um can we just go over that again
uh so bas at twel alright yeah okay
so cost like production cost is twelve fifty but selling price is is that wholesale or retail like on the shelf
our sale our sale anyway yeah okay okay
okay
mm hmm
alright
yes
mm hmm
mm hmm
well right away i'm wondering if there's um th th uh like with d v d  players if there are zones
um f frequencies or something um as well as uh
characters um different uh keypad styles and s symbols
um
i don't know
yeah
yeah
yeah and then a and then al the other thing international is on top of the price i'm thinking
the price might might appeal to a certain market in one region whereas in another it'll be different so
just a chara just a characteristic of the
just
or just like basic product podi positioning the twenty five euro remote control might be a big hit in london might not be such a big hit in greece who knows something like that yeah

yep
right away i'm making some kind of assumptions about what what information we're given here thinking 'kay trendy probably means something other than just basic something other than just standard um
so i'm wondering right away is selling twenty five euros is that sort of the thi is this gonna to be like the premium product kinda thing or
uh huh
mm hmm
yep
yeah i'd say so yeah
no
yeah yeah
mm hmm
do we have any other background information on like how that compares to other
other
yeah
mm hmm
yeah interesting thing about discussing um production of a remote control for me is that l as
you point out i just don't think of remote controls as somethin something people consciously assess
in their purchasing habits it's just like getting shoelaces with shoes or something
it just comes along
do you know what i mean like so sort of like how do you i i mean one one way of looking at it would be well the people producing
television sets maybe they have to buy remote controls or another way is maybe people who have t v  sets are really fed up with
their remote control and they really want a better one or something
but
right right okay so
right so in function one of the priorities might be to combine as many uses
i think so yeah yeah
yeah
well like um maybe what we could use is a sort of like a example of a successful other piece technology is palm palm pilots they're gone from being just like little sort of scribble boards to cameras m p  three players telephones
everything agenda so like i wonder if we might add something new to the to the remote control market such as the lighting in your house or um
yeah yeah an
yeah like p personally for me at home i've i've combined the um the audio video of my television
set and my d v d  player and my c d  player so they w all work actually function together but i have different remote controls
for each of them so it's sort of ironic that that then they're in there
um
you know the sound and everything it's just one system but each one's got its own little
part
mm
mm mm
mm hmm mm hmm
yeah
yeah
that's just really good id
yep
uh sure i remember when the first remote control my my
family had was on a cable actually had a cable between it and the t v  and big like buttons that sort of like like on a blender
or something and um you know when i think about what they are now it's better but actually it's still kind of
i dunno like a massive junky thing on the table maybe we could think about how could be more
you know streamlined s
something like that yeah or whatever would be technologically reasonable
'cause it could b it could it could be that f it could be that functionally that doesn't make it any better but that just the appeal of of not having
you know these days there's a r pe things in people's homes are becoming more and more like chic you know um
nicer materials and might be
be worth exploring anyway
okay

um

before we wrap up just to make sure we're all on the same page here um do we we were given sort of an example of a coffee machine or something right well
um
are we at ma right now on the assumption that our television remote control may have features which go beyond the television or are we keeping sort of like a a design commitment to television features i i don't know
yep yeah sure
okay
okay yeah
okay
okay
okay
alright


did you get my email with the slides
ah tricky
dunno maybe they're supposed the pen's supposed to go over the seats
might be seat floor rather than person
yeah put it back
yep
yeah jo's making faces at me
mm hmm
mm
mm object tracking

okay
well we can't no we can't do evaluation 'til we have a design
mm hmm
mm 'kay

mm hmm
mm hmm

mm hmm
mm hmm
oh yeah
mm hmm
yeah
mm hmm
okay so it's it's t a very basic remote then it's only
mm
mm
can i see
thanks
okay i like the volume control that's good

uh huh
so it doesn't actually have buttons
did you wanna see
mm
it won't talk back
right
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm
so it's well outside the budget then
that's on top of the sixteen or is it part of that
so that takes it down to thirteen euros without the speech recognition
mm hmm
mm
what's this one on the side
ah okay
mm hmm mm 'kay i like the shape of them i do like the
the size and the the shape
mm hmm
okay and maybe we run the evaluation on both of the products both of these two
okay
basically this is what we've talked about already um from the marketing point of view we just wanna make sure that we've taken into account yep
so it's just a shortlist of criteria on um the things that we've identified as being important to
selling the product um we just go through these and rate them as a group and then at
the end we'll make an evaluation based on that so just average the score of those items so
these are the things we identified as being important um the three things were
look and feel innovation and ease of use were the three important components um appealing
to the correct demographic so using those things in the right way to appeal to our demographic and then
goin following the company motto following the fashion trends and putting that into the product as well
so well do you wanna go through and put through those on the the two products now or do we wanna discuss them further and then evaluate them
okay
so f just go through onto the whiteboard i guess not sure how this is gonna come out
so the first one was really very far below budget would you want to take the price down of the end product according to that or just have the high profit on it 'cause if we're only going to make it for eight euros then we have a
mm hmm
mm hmm
yep
mm hmm
okay so look and feel innovation


mm hmm
and trends
oh you following the idea of using the um removable covers on these is that part of both of them or
okay
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
no
mm hmm okay
okay yep so it's the pink
and the other one's green
okay so look and feel
where um one is i've broken the pen again
s yeah get that one um w one's bad and seven's the best sorry one's true and seven's false one's the best
so on a scale of one to seven
mm hmm
mm hmm yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm
on the scale u it's between functional and fancy basically we're looking at so
mm hmm
four okay
mm hmm

mm
no that's the ink's dried
battery's low isn't it the ink the b that's the that that one battery there
mm
no i think it's lost a battery
no it's it would still write but it wouldn't pick it up with the sensors
you got a second
well we won't be able to tell
is that working
did it come out good okay because we'll be able to see it still even if it wasn't working it's just a normal whiteboard marker but it wouldn't be picked up on the the actual whiteboard
and the other one

i think it's slightly better um
it's hard to tell from just the plasticine but
mm
mm
okay
mm hmm yeah
yeah the other thing is is the left hand one protruding 'cause if people are left handed they want to use the other hand maybe it won't work so well
okay
i'd say two or three for that one personally
probably more towards three than two
okay
mm okay
yeah it's d it's definitely more fancier than that one
okay
so consensus two or three two
um 'kay innovation the first one not really muc
mm
yeah do we
mm
what what features are we actually including are we including like a location kind of thing like trying to find it
there's nothing like that
but th is there any there's no actual innovation in that at all it's just a straight out remote control
okay
okay so there's no this uh look and feel thing though that's not a technological innovation so i'd be up for seven for innovation
okay
so what is it what are the innovations with this got the l c d  screen
is that in this one though is this 'cause this is the
th th there were different options we discussed then we discussed the one that was in budget and the one that was out of budget
okay so the cost for these were what was the cost for the first one eight euros
and this one was sixteen euros
okay so
innovation for this one is two one
two
mm well the speech recognition is a very good innovation i believe it so
give it a one yep
okay ease of use
mm
yeah
yep so that's maybe a a two for ease of use
okay
so maybe a three or a four
mm
okay
consensus three or four
three okay
mm hmm
okay
so three's uh how well it goes to the target demographic
so we're d we're still thinking twenty to forty year olds that's
mm
so sh completely changed our demographic there it's not part of the the funky young thing
yeah
if it was the very bottom price range or it was like between this and another one we did the same thing then i can imagine it being applying to the the demographic yeah that's it's still ye
mm 'cause we have got room we've got some budget there to add a few things to it that's right
mm hmm
and
mm
but it's going to be cheap whatever though it was set with i we've got a set price
yeah there's nothing that would make me spend an extra k few euros on that one rather than another one
okay um and the demokraphi demographic of the second one
it's got the got the the toys in it it's got the l c d  screen and
mm
yeah
mm hmm
yeah i think especially if we're gonna n have an l c d  screen on a low range product then that's good
mm okay
i'd probably go with three again for that one
mm hmm
okay so two yeah
mm hmm
yeah
yep and especially i guess 'cause this has the speech recognition as well and that makes it more appealing it's more of a a new fun toy
mm hmm
okay
and following the trends so the trends were the fruit and vegetables and the spongy feel
so as it is not really doing either of them
well the spongy could be part of the the feel of the buttons as well i know some have you tried the mobile phones that have got the kinda spongy buttons and not
not exactly spongy but i'm thinking one of the nokias that's got like you ca it hasn't got individual buttons it's got just a
one bit on it and so you can that feels kinda spongy
so it's sort of yeah
mm okay
but that's if you're using the covers or is it just one
well they make it for mobiles it can't be that much more complicated
so you got the option of having different colours or different textures
mm
mm
mm hmm
i think the if we do the cover that's really going with the company's philosophy of having the fashion in in electronics it lets people have the latest fashion even next year when fruit and vegetables might be out you'll still be able to put a new cover on it and then it'll still be in fashion
mm
mm
mm
mm
yep
yep
mm
and then you have the option of having the different colours different covers
mm there's n yeah 'cause that's the that's the feature that could be included in either of them although it is more with the spongy buttons on the um
on the other one
okay so two and three or one and two

mm hmm
okay
okay so the average of that is
three six nine divided by five so five
mm
nine by five one point s eight
this one eleven thirteen nineteen twenty one divided by five is four point two yep
okay but we still got a very different price for those two so they're not really comparable yet anyway
yep
yep

mm hmm
well it's easier to just make that one cheaper by just taking the speech recognition out that'll basically take us down to the budget
mm
yeah it's gonna be more than just the biggest case definitely
either of them
mm they're both going to be not basic cases
mm hmm
yeah the basic one yep
so now we're either going button or l c d s l c d  display
is that price per unit or for the whole
thing
so it would need twelve buttons
mm and that's without any special button supplements
so we'd have a special colour special form and special material on all of them they're not just standard buttons
but i thought it would be curved on two it's like it's curved on the sides and curved on the top and bottom as well that's what i thought
you talking about concave curves
you think a single curved
mm
we have more we've got those the scroll wheel on the side and yeah
the sc
mm
we've got a scroll wheel for the volume don't we or is it some other thing that's not on there
'kay we've only got five minutes left guys so we need to wrap it up pretty fast
so this is even more than the um
than the cost you gave the sixteen euros
but that's seven basic buttons right seven buttons without any adds on without special colours or form or material
well
so the l c d  display is is three francs sorry three euros by itself
mm
so twelve euro fifty we got two off of the battery we can't do anything about that so ten fifty if we want an l c d  dispra display that's seven fifty
um so we've got seven fifty to use for the case and for the buttons
and the chip sorry the chip's up there already
so we're gonna have to scale this down to get within budget there's no doubt about that
mm
yep
mm
yeah
i think unless we can really drive these prices down we need to get rid of the l c d  display
for the price it's gonna be what we can afford and it's looking like we can't afford the l c d  display there's no way we can get it in there
mm
mm hmm
i th i'd like t it to be in but i can't see it happening i can't see it fitting in
bu y you're a power voter uh veto anyway as project manager
well we have to make a decision now that's it
mm i think then we we're really losing ease of use
okay
okay so l c d 's out is speech rec out now we've
yep
yep
so are we basically back to the original one now back to the first version which turns out to be on budget exactly pretty much
with these new costings so just look at forget that one and look at that one now
mm
yep
okay well that's that's
yep
so
mm
yep so w we can go back and l talk to the suppliers maybe and see if we can drive the prices down to add a few more things in but that's all we can do with the restrictions we have at the moment
mm hmm
okay
okay
so
matthew is uh late again
probably an important man um
so well it is important for him to be here uh
he he he
you did work together didn't you
yes
yes yes
mm um yes but w we


yes maybe we should phone him
um well
um when he is not here we will just we just have to continue um so just for record i i will take uh notes again
and um
well first thing uh i was uh
uh i got an email from uh from my superior again that we really should stay
within the budget of the uh twelve euro and fifty cents it's
uh well he said to me well uh
when you stay in it's good when you don't stay in you have to redesign there is no uh no negotiation uh possible in this matter
so we have to consider that
good
um
so maybe anna you can have your presentation
okay matthew nice uh you are here
great great oh ma maybe then you can start now with mm presenting your uh your designs


mm
eye
uh huh
yes
ah okay
mm hmm
yeah yeah yeah
mm
exce except for the for the special shape the surfing board it has a quite a a conventional layout of buttons uh


mm hmm yeah no you can carry on i just
look how it feels all yes it really feels like like like a mobile phone
just i'm i really want to talk to it but so but but continue with your uh mm hmm
mm
mm hmm
mm hmm
from d v d  player to television or something
yes
mm
yes and and and then you get feedback via the l c d  yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm
yeah but but but but uh i in there uh when this is closed will it also uh cover up the l c d  screen
but but the l c d  screen i mean is a very uh
well an eye attracting feature which shouldn't be shouldn't be

that th that's true
mm
mm hmm mm hmm yes yes more robust
yes okay
mm hmm
okay
but w
mm 'kay hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
well well
mm be before ta talking about the money and what's possible and what is not possible maybe anna you can uh give our uh give us your um
yes evalua evaluation and also the evaluation criteria so what what is important to look at
mm hmm
well just
do it quickly if if we al already
mm hmm
mm hmm
um n no why not why not discuss uh discuss it now
mm well my my personal view is uh w when when this one is eight euros we must think how can we improve it
and then i mean w w w you must just see it we can still spend this four and a half euro and
to r because th th th the the selling price is already prite fik uh uh quite fixed on twenty five euros
so we just have to offer as much as as well value for the for the customer uh he can have for twenty five euro
mm
um well w w we can still discuss that so um and together with
evaluating this uh we we might come with new ideas i mean adding things or uh
removing uh of options because they are too expensive but
um
i've received uh a framework which we can do this i mean did you have this this excel sheet
no okay this is these are the the the latest prices of our production uh uh
production unit for several components so we can uh
see whether the the price is is within the twelve euro uh fifty cents uh
so maybe we can start with this uh calling this one
th th this is the first design
yes
uh there is another pen
okay
'kay
okay so look and feel
well you already feel that uh pretty much i think
in i in my opinion
purely feel is is is very good is very good in your hand so i i i would consider two or or may maybe even one for feel but that's just half we should also consider look and then
i it looks
quite conventional
don't you agree
so maybe two hmm hmm ma ma ma ma maybe say say five
i it's my opinion but i don't know what what
four four now we th th then we settle on four
'kay can you maybe fix the other
mm try it just try it oh it will not ri mm mm
yes it it has a mm
good good
okay so then then
ah
mm
i i
i
when we want to include i i i'm doubting about this this component
it it it it breaks in your
mm yes i see mm okay
well r r
mm
i think the look is better but the feel is is is worse so so i would also say this is four but w w do you what do you think
mm mm yes
yes it basically is the same shape
mm hmm mm
yeah yeah yeah
yes okay
two mm two's good yes
mm
mm hmm mm hmm the only innova innovation is the shape
s so that
mm
yes a and the l c d  screen is
that's that's that's well it's quite innovative
mm
yeah mm mm mm mm
we just diske discuss it as you designed it and then we will will try to get it in the budget
eight
yes
two
why it is one

a man w w
yes
this this is it w with the speech recognition
well gi given that that it works then it's i think one

mm
hmm
three i would three
no
yeah
yes but then when when he is used to it i i it is quite easy
so so i think th three is good yeah
good what's the next
so
twe twenty to forty yes that's

mm hmm
well exce except for the surfing shape i mean that's that's something which which has an appeal on this group i think but
mm w w w we after this we can can consider uh for instance making this more attractive to to the demographic
mm
but as it is now i w would say
mm six something
do you agree
mm yeah indeed th t t
ju just think twenty five euros i mean it's not going to be cheaper
mm mm okay
yeah tha tha tha tha tha that's i think it's better because of the l c d  screen which is really an appeal on the on the on the
on the and on the
mm so the l c d  screen uh attracts yes because it
mm ma maybe that's something to consider yes so
wh what what
no s say t two two
okay the final point trends
mm mm
i think

mm
mm
and the then we can al yes we can we can consider uh uh is it possible do you think to to make a cover
for s such a phone i mean
well just with the with the flexible plastic uh
i th i th i think
o o or just two things which can be put on each other
yes exactly like it uh so
maybe we can but we have to decide it we can put the the the fancy f look of vegetables for instance to to these covers and s now try to invest in the in in the features
mm
mm mm mm mm mm
mm hmm mm hmm
mm mm
yes so so so that that would make the trends equal so we we we really have don't have
i mean
mm
yes indeed
yes
say say one and two one and two
so le le let's see so d this one has spongy but buttons
mm i see yes okay good
just add it you know three six seven
mm hmm
we we must try to get them closer
both in i i or we just have to choose and adapt because when we choose for this one we have to we have to make it more attractive and w when we to d for this one we have to make it more cheap

yes well
but i'm now did y did you work with the same prices that i have here
mm
mm tha
well yes well uh re reconsider it so let's let's try to to model this this phone in this sheet uh what kind of energy source uh i i we didn't speak about that it's a it's a normal battery or
yes just so one battery 'kay
electronics given speech recognition i think w you should go for the less fancy chip
yeah yes or sample sensor yes
yes this one okay case
um
i see i
double curve

mm
oh yes we are talking about but they have the same shape but actually bu
so th th this would be double curves
'kay
uh plastic would be the material
uh special colour now we leave it to the covers
push
mm yes but
yeah th now this is per per unit this number of components
so one two three four five six seven eight nine t
yes twelve i believe
so this comes to eighteen
so
so i think but th do you agree th that thi
yes i
yes i'm i'm no i'm no i'm not sh
sure
yes i kno undes i understand what you mean yes
uh huh
both
yes
uh
w d we have we haven't talk about a but that's no a is very exp inexpensive i believe but it is not in the list
w ho h is this a scroll wheel or is this a a a sort of button which can be pressed on two sides uh so for higher and lower
mm mm hmm
so um
we're
we
we could go for the for the for the for the for a simple chip but then we can't have the the speech recognition yes yes
so so w when we w a this would this would be cutting the speech recognition
transti
say say it's regular regular chip and we still on fifteen so
yes but that maybe
well we can just say
one
ca l we are just when we just want to uh to cut the number of buttons we have to make seven to to fit in in twelve twelve fifty
so is it possible
mm hmm

no no he he he i i
mm hmm
mm hmm
otherwise y you ha you have a s ve very normal uh thing like this
mm
mm hmm mm hmm
a
mm
mm i
i think we have to come to a decision now just i i think we we what we just do i is vote
about the uh the l c d  uh display so
yes yes yes one man one vote s so who thinks the the l c d  disply display should be i should be in it
mm mm hmm mm hmm
mm hmm i know but
yes so uh uh having an l c d  s display is just uh uh have very very limited amount of buttons is that acceptable ca can i have can the functions be implement in an
you've you you agree
so hav hav having seven buttons instead of twelve
so that wou would be cutting cutting suh say about these buttons
mm
mm so um i i think we should we should cut the l c d  screen that that's that's my opinion
just
uh where l c 
okay w we now we can just uh
yes yes i th i th i think w we just go for this one and that that now twelve euros is the
is is the price okay my m my supervisor will be glad that it's fifty cents cheaper than he expected
okay
okay good then we the same thank you that was it
i guess i have to change the pen otherwise will be completely different
yeah and do you think it's
yeah
yeah
so what can you
yeah we will yeah so i will be able to to summarize
uh our meeting but still i think uh it would be in very important if the uh as um
main designer
i think we can put on the here
uh basically w yeah we we designed the two uh items
um can we have a phone can someone
it's really w well designed
yeah
'kay
yep
great
yep
so i will start by the the basic one that uh
fits into uh eight euros actually
right seven eight euros and uh well first
for both they have um a special shape maybe the designer can uh explain better than me
but uh it's like a surf board and you you are supposed to surf to browse
to surf t v  maybe the web and uh it's kind of interesting
shape because um unconsciously people want to s to surf
when they see this stuff and also it's not too far from um a mobile
so people are used to that kind of shape right don't take care too much about the colour because w yeah
we don't take yeah so here would be basically the the
the infrared uh uh led yeah l a  l a  l e d 
the on off button in red here would be the volume
on the on the left okay so easy to turn on t and off and um
so this is a very cheap version so there are maybe you can carry on uh matthew
how can you change from v c r  to uh t v  by the way
okay yeah yeah yeah
yeah

seven eight ei eight euros
yeah

yeah
yeah
yeah actually yeah


play pause
exactly yeah to audio and to video on demand
yes
this is the orange button the microphone
an yeah
yeah
yeah
crazy dis designer okay
yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah
oh actually well
it's low weight you have to see yeah yeah the the components we put inside is very low weight
so the the cost is actually a bit more it's uh it's it's sixteen francs
sixteen euros sorry
then it's out of budget but the the main point we we talk about that with our uh manufacturer
and they say basically that the s r  system would be uh something like three
francs per item so three euros sorry and um
no no no part of that yeah
yeah yeah
well i think th th yeah we should stick with uh a number of keys because if we add too much then
it's too
locati location
yeah
mm hmm
functionality
easy to use
target
no

yeah
yeah four maybe
uh
yeah if you press like this not like this then you

but
okay
try a
perfect

yeah yeah
yep
wow
'kay maybe
it's not a button it's a led it's a
ac actually yeah it should be embedded
yeah
oh you can push push it again you can push it

yeah
and the l c d  makes it better yeah
so i will say two
i would say two three
yep
basically there is no innovation in the first one compared to what exists in the market right
yeah the surf uh design
yeah
yeah
yeah you're right
yeah
and the
and the second one is really uh state of the art uh in terms of innovation
and um with many more functionalities and can
open and close the the bottom part
yeah
and all the scrolling uh buttons and menu and pro programmable device behind this
uh could put it at one or two i would say
personally
uh
yeah automatic speech recognition
yeah
so
eight
well actually we have yeah to check again yeah
sixteen
w w un to be one what would do we nee actually yeah i don't see okay one would would be without buttons
bu
yeah so maybe we can put one
it's using speech recognition yeah
yeah one yeah
so the first one is really standard so everybody i including our grandmothers can use it right
yeah
um the other one is quite easy tho though
one me um we hope maybe sometimes people get uh scared with the number of buttons
and there is a like i would say three or maybe four
yeah yeah because it's n uh it's not like a big one with uh one hundred buttons or so
this one would be uh for grandmothers
no
yeah grandmothers yeah
yeah that's true
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah because it's so important it's i it was written that it really so important the um the the look and uh taking care of its it targets the right range of people right
yeah but w
yeah
but for us it's yeah we have a constraint that we need to sell at twenty five euros

yeah
yeah
yeah and if you want to target yeah if we we wish to to sell four millions of this i think for this audience we need absolutely the l c d  screen
yeah
or even
even one and two
or two
yeah two yeah
yeah
spongy
uh that means that it goes in in the water
uh okay
but this one includes this feature right spongy buttons
so
uh the maybe in the colour we can make it uh fruit and and veggie
yeah
yeah this is possible
yeah exactly like nokia phones
yeah
'cause sometimes look at this computer th this laptop it's all black and uh it's quite conventional
and sometimes people don't like too much flashy colours like this one presented here so maybe we could
do like in the range the set of what we propose a black one very
standard one that meets the the requirements of th such people that want really standard
uh things
yeah
yeah so a a point better for the for the number two


okay
yeah the blue one uh spongy
nine

very good
yeah it's right yeah that's right
so i i give yeah i just give a call with the manufacturer uh and uh i explained them
and they told me this could be possible for sixteen fr euros uh unfortunately we didn't see
this chip uh matthew so maybe we have to recap with this one
for this one it's a normal battery
uh sample speaker yeah
sample yeah this one
so
so which one are we talking to
well
yeah
is it zero franc
l c d  is it's okay just say l c d 
no but for this one it's twelve euro
there are twelve
wait a minute it's not it's not double curved it's single curved right because it's there is no like
well it's you know this curve like this so it's w there is only
is is is there is nothing like y you know in the other stuff there are yeah concave so i think we can put um
the single curved in the sixteen
that makes uh seventeen and what are just the bt buttons we have twelve buttons are you sure yeah
so i had a bad uh
bad estimation
no no no
yes a kind of scroll wheel
okay so based on that yeah um where is the es okay sample speaker
but still yeah it
no we cannot yeah so
but the um
yeah but if you have the near the l c d  you can um choose select between um you know like uni universal between audio t v  and v c r  and this needs a needs a advanced chip
right matthew
or regular chip
i think yeah regular today we you can do that with regular chip
yeah okay okay
so and what about the number of buttons buttons uh
my matthew

when you look at this w this u uh item
but
you cannot make a phone to your boss saying twelve fifty is really
really low no
and uh we don't want to to change that right we we really want a l c d  other otherwise we w wouldn not get the market
it's evident
yeah
and i dunno
so wha what what each of us think about the because it's measure point the l c d  um
do you think it's important
because sometimes whe when you watch the t v  in fact you have a big display and maybe you don't need one more in your hands i dunno i'm just asking
yeah it's true yeah
but uh do we want that
on the market point of view yeah what do you think uh l c d  is a major feature or
you assume you want a democratic voyt vote right okay
okay
we need to be
yeah
yes
because one yeah th show me that uh actually we could in fact we move
these three buttons and have three uh possibilities for each of the three here
here one at the middle and at the
bottom
okay
okay
the speech recognition is out
because of the budget yeah
yes
yeah
actually yeah we we we will not need the really uh expert designers um because the amount yeah
thanks

or browse
mm
now we are supposed to give some oper offers right now
i yeah
l e d 
mm hmm hmm
also so you have uh uh browsing the channels
actually so you can go up and down the channels uh if you have a video
or something you can forward back
oh no no no this is a single this this is a model with just the t v  one no no just sorry this
is a standard t v  one we are not talking about that so and then we have usually there twelve keys but we know that we rel
that we have only ten digits the extra two are for uh having or giving an option
for uh having more than one channel
and the other one is for the teletext or something you want to browse through from that actually
it's a very basic minimal thing which you can which is which is also available in the market actually that's what it that it i and would cost us to build it about eight euros
yeah
yeah
so this one model and uh yeah sure
th this is a magic one but i know we don't want to talk about that you know like uh i i
i it is a very futuristic it's like uh it's like a brain machine interface and
all this stuff we are thinking about in the future it can come so that uh
then what we look t yeah
this is a model yeah
yep
uh so well then the this is the a more
a little uh smooth and it gives a lot of functionality uh in this way so all
we have uh th you see there are only six keys but don't worry they are ma they are doing the job of twelve
keys actually here
and so they have more space actually and uh it's easy to uh use this
and uh you have um so this is a standard uh uh infrared
eye and then you have a power button which l volume what you have and then other than that
you have uh channel up and down and uh f slow pause or s
slow lo yeah s pause or stop and uh then
uh you can uh you have a l c d  display here and uh
y this is a functional thing which can change like it's a toggle switch which could
change the function say y you press it
yeah i really can change it so
instead of having many switches y
the l c d  can display what is that on that and uh well you can have a integrated microphone
over here or in the button th here so which can
uh basically you want to do a speech recognition and uh that channel a lot of information can be di
displayed here directly on the um on your on your display and
here is a small l e d  which is like blinking one which tells you like uh are you running
out of the battery and which is can be useful for the locating as i was talking earlier okay
and uh well then we have a cover basically basically you don't need much of the time this
when you need you can use it and this gives additional functionality that tomorrow you want you can add a tactile
thing
to this cover you know design enter
yeah
yeah it's basically to do that

actually when you are watching the t v  when you are watching anything or listening to them you hardly care about
what is getting displayed here you know uh you want to uh and this gives
a protection to the l c d  actually giving a cover to that actually gives a protection because when
it falls down or something
it it is it is is is it gives a protec it's more robust that way uh yeah and you have very good chances
yeah
yeah
it
sixteen euros

yeah
three euros
part of that
yeah
well uh if you we can have if you have new more ideas we can add new more uh some more keys if you want to you know
yeah it it should not be cluttering up everything
ah that's for the it's kind of a l e d  for indicating your battery and as well as it's like a blinking one you know you can keep it aside
yeah
and now it easy to use
no
mm yeah
well i will give it maybe we have anyways the way we have designed it's like the surf as you say you know it though the look is fine but uh still i will give four in that case you know
four yeah that
yeah
i will gi yeah
no c can you get the batteries no no the battery has fallen down that's i
yeah
no no it's not that it's how to close a battery
okay now it should be
is there another battery there oh yeah


no actually this is this is not going to protrude actually it it's n i it is jus
it's a led actually which which 'll be covering in a curve
it's will be embedded there so it won't be really you know protruding or something
yeah
yeah
yeah no you it it not protruding actually it will go in better into that
uh it's fine i think my just that um the feel is that um
you right now you you don't see the feel because right uh for example if you press it quite inside now like this now it's embedded one
this is how embedded one will
yeah it's a bas basically the same thing actually you will be except that in this c
yeah and you might have a slight thing for to forward and
yeah yeah
yeah
looking like
no but except for the design of the surf you should be rea

uh no i think it's more of the feel
yeah yeah yeah
say about that
yeah
yep
yeah it gives it
yep
no we ha
yeah eight euros yeah
sixteen euros
it's a two i would say two

yeah
okay yeah
uh
he is used to it act
they are used to it actually
here there may
uh though it has more functionality i think it shouldn't be for the user to learn it actually it shouldn't be diffi
uh yeah actually in fact i think it will be yeah
yeah but y
well we have reduced the keys actually you see three is fine with me
yeah it's a actually the user has to put some effort to do use that actually it's not so easy like this one the normal
is quite easy yeah initially there there is a lot of effort yeah
mm
oh no this would i i would i would give this model to the old people actually yeah
and
oh yeah
i well i think
yeah uh yeah but but if you sell it in the market it's going to be cheap actually
so
and people can still decide to use the cheaper one
instead of a
okay
okay so in that case well it's fine then we can yeah
and the demographics of
yeah i think it's uh it has more market actually
y yeah you know two
yeah two yeah because tomorrow this will be more appealing because you can add lot of sophistication on that because then you you have it uh d you have lot of things which you can include for the people to
we have to practically test it the field test will tell you how good
the trends
mm hmm
yeah i know
yeah we we we we we yeah it's the way they are going to be actually
but why do you want to cover that actually in that uh w in the mod
uh uh y are you sure
yeah i think yeah it should be possible like what we do with the mobile phone yeah
yep
yeah it's one
yeah it says a
one point six one point
one point eight yeah
four point
uh four point two
wow
yeah yep
maybe we ought to reconsider everything with this yeah
mm hmm
yeah it migh it it'll need uh more than a conventional one it won't be uh just maybe you might use a a a  battery actually
what do you say mael
yeah
curved double curved yeah right it's uh
are you talking about this or that
mm hmm
yeah
a special colour
uh
ah good
yeah we might need a scroll wheel right for that
no for that one also
yeah that's a scroll
yeah one scroll wheel you might need
uh
bad estimate right

that is the sample sensor and sample speaker
we just need that actually
we need one
s
oh i i it
i think it's going to be y y yeah it's th with the regular chip yeah
yeah
uh
yeah
that'll be then we have uh have to ask the user to press it several times


uh
or we could even replace them by buttons actually
a actually it depends it depends what kind of functionalities you want to add into it for example if you add two more
functionalities then better you add two more buttons or and you'll have l c d  display which is that is
going to bring the cost by two two euros at least
okay so we can get rid of it and then add a couple of buttons
i think but
yeah but the only thing is that what is the multiple functionalities you want to include with that
yeah
w i i i just
yeah
that will create another problem for the people to use it
it's not going to be easy
doing that
no it's okay you uh cut the l c d  screen and introduce two more buttons
yeah
yeah
okay that's it
cool
uh 'kay
so
yep
okay so we're here to talk about the detailed design of the product 'kay
and here's the agenda for this meeting uh i'm just gonna open say a few boring words
to start with again and start taking minutes afterwards you guys are gonna give us a presentation of our wonder product that
i can see some demonstrations of over there looks cool
and then we're gonna evaluate it then we're gonna talk about finance and i've got a lovely
excel spreadsheet that i knocked up in the last five minutes for this and uh yep
and we're gonna evaluate the product and close got forty minutes to do this in we should
be fine let's try and keep this one on schedule so

your
thing is in where is it is it in
who wants it
zapping your favourite channels eh
oh okay okay
ah 'kay okay that's favourites
ah 'kay i like the the the the logo on there as well
it is very prominent so this is the
okay
ah okay i see
it's pretty cool
is that could that be easy to for the scroll wheel to be rotated if it lands on it

oh well i guess it depends on the stiffness a little of it
mm feels good i take it that this is gonna be slightly lighter in the final design as well
yeah it's kinda cool you have to reach a little bit don't you
ah yeah that wouldn't make sense
it's cool i'm impressed
and hold it so wh what's the marketing perspective
okay
mm it's impressing so let me get it if i press this button
i see that's pretty cool hang on


i plan to do that as well so the the two blue are are those for the the it to charge off of in
ah okay okay

yeah it's the right shape isn't it
but maybe if you had a trigger plus the scroll then that would get past the the problem of it landing and scrolling 'cause then it would need to be hit on both sides
okay
but it's definitely got options for like different types of models and things as well based on that hasn't it
so is that the the final colour scheme as well or
okay
the hmm
it came off the scroll wheels a problem with them not being sort of
i don't think the user interface guy wants to touch it anymore
mm
okay enough of that well i it's cool guys
'kay so are we done with the this presentation
okay
now now
have you okay
can i not get your get at stuff from your shared folder now
oh i see i see



do you would you a argue that that we're better going for the higher cost than bringing it down into twenty f five as we probably could but lowering our profit margins
mm hmm
mm 'kay
and we're actually quite open to be able to expand the product for a later version with those features quite simply anyway aren't we th there's no fundamentally different technology to do that
hmm
yeah the plus there's the the risk of making it unusable as well or making it less b because at the moment it's actually very straightforward to look at all the buttons you know what they do it's very simple and it just works
mm there's a risk of that
okay so we can talk about finance now
so i have a little spreadsheet for us where i i was wondering you when you talked about the fifteen point eight euros i was wondering how you came up with that figure
okay so i have bit of a spreadsheet here for this
now
i've made a f few assumptions here in that i'm assuming that our power adaptor we can
make for a cost of four euros equivalent to solar cells which i think is probably
fair considering that we have in house manufacturing of power adaptors already uh
and i'm assuming that the locator beacon the you know the
can be made for it sounded different that time uh can be made for a similar price to uh an l c  display uh an uh
uh do you think that's fair coming from a m the manufacturing
okay
yep
okay
so we're down to sixteen point four yeah
is that a single curved rather than a double curved
we're not entirely sure what single curve versus double cur
you think okay i'm convinced
but we save one euro that way yeah so we come bring it down to
fifteen point four
well hang on do don't speak so it's in here in that w do we have any we have special form don't
we so that's yeah but the the the we haven't talked about any special colour
though uh i don't th if we're going for greys and silvers then i don't think we're
o okay so we're
push button scroll wheel we're basically we have uh th is this intended to be a button as well or just a scroll just a scroll it's not one of the scrolls where for example with this one you could push it down to be a button
okay then we have fifteen point eight euros
it wasn't bad
okay so
we're on to the
we're on to the pat on the back part of the
presentation where we have a look at the criterias th that paul the criterion criteria that paul has has given us and we can use that to tell
how's it going
anyone got any thoughts how how have we done today
i think we did pretty well too that looks pretty spectacular
any other chang uh thoughts
okay so th th what about um room for creativity
is it the
i i think we we ended up being quite creative there
mm
not every idea necessarily it's still a remote control uh no yeah but we did we did break with the specs a little bit i guess but the uh
'kay leadership what do we report back to the bosses no th th i think they were r reasonably flexible with us over the whole changing the specs thing
i agree
synergy
teamwork yeah he is uh
what did we think of the meeting room i guess is an important thing here
mm
yeah this falls off and uh the white board worked really well without any pro
mm mm lapel wha okay oh alright
that's it's down it's quite close
keep it keep it calm
oh dear no more pizza for me so yeah the the pen came in alright and it's a little uncomfortable to use but i guess it works
nah i'm i'm not convinced of that at all i've been wor i've been wondering about that all day but see these look like they're
that looks the oth that looks like it would be that way around but it feels more comfortable wh what you call upside down
i don't care uh okay so that data might be slightly invalid what new ideas have we found
well let's do both then uh for the product
yeah we came up with quite a bit
and for the meeting room has anyone got any more
yeah less sore on the ears
okay so
are the costs within the budget
nope oh hang on it really that's something we that the costs were under twelve fifty euros no requirements are changed we're still under twenty euros to build so we're good
and the costs within the budget not the original budget but they are now is the project evaluated mm i think so yeah then celebration as it says
oh i don't know how that got there uh anyway
thank
thanks guys
yeah i've got a lot of paperwork to catch up on too
oh
put on your mic
boss
yep


alright
three three
pedro can have it
i like i'll help talk

unit price
scrolling through your favourites list
it's very prominent
so here i'll give you the so this is the cradle unit and this is the actual remote
itself um so the scroll bar is or the scroll wheel is this this green
little scrolly guy here um and then the volume controls are here and here uh you've got the keypad which
is the numbers uh f from zero to nine and then ten this is the power button uh we have
our um we have the enter button and uh what was the other button here
this is the teletext
the programme button yeah the programme button so this bl this button will be used both for the favourites and for programming
your uh the um the type of television you wanna use so um the
plastic is the white area of this of the model here and the red area is like a rubber covering
so you can see that when it lays like this or like this and the buttons are all gonna be rubber so it's pretty
hard to actually damage it um
yeah that might be a possible
a mi uh possible problem but if you drop it yeah
yeah and it depends on if it's sliding but i think it's pretty ergonomic you can feel it
yeah of course well this is clay
yeah the the power button is a bit of a reach but i think we might scale down the final model a bit these this is a bit larger than it would be but

mm pedro can demonstrate the the paging ability
beep beep beep

um beep beep beep so beep
beep beep beep beep beep be shut
up beep beep beep
okay um no no no tha that's alri
exactly that's exactly what those are for and um there's one other feature that we were debating but we decided to go
against it is um you could beep beep beep we were thinking that
it might be interesting to have a trigger button here because you have this finger it it's it kinda feels like there should be something there but
we couldn't figure out what button is important enough to put there and we we don't wanna accidentally be hitting the power button like that
so
mm
right
so maybe in a final design phase we might tweak that a little bit but
mm hmm
oh no this is just what we had to work with at the time
so we'll leave the colour scheme up to the marketing people

careful


beep beep beep
yeah



no way
beep beep beep
mm hmm
well that was just just our technical team added up the um production costs of the individual units
oh

uh huh
uh huh
yeah
oh sorry
yeah um i do think we that we we uh don't need the events chip on print we only need the uh the regular chip on print so there may have been a m miscalculation in there
and we and we have a single curved uh
uh i think that
it's single curved yeah
see it's a little bit more than f single curved so yeah it's fifteen point eight that's where we came up with it
okay
yeah we do
ah what do you know
oh it's a that's not very special it's pretty
if th
that's a scroll
uh no we just use it as a scroll
it was a pretty accurate estimate i would say
yeah
s 's kind of s frighteningly accurate
what
i think we did pretty well
sh i think there was plenty of room we got a couple innovative i
couple innovative ideas
mm hmm

yep
there was a lot of synergy
these cables suck
yep
yeah
lapel
that's our boss
pedro's right
pedro's right
oh wel
well we had the favourites list and the scroll bar and we have the cradle
and the r uh remote call feature

all right


good job guys
so you forgot how this works again
boss
hmm you knocked it up


thi third third third
the end product thingy
yeah

um yeah so what we ended up with
production costs estimated by our manufacturing department and um the research department which is us
is uh fifteen point eight euros someone forgot the units there yeah uh unit price unit
production price cost thing um
we implemented the basic functions which is just t v  functions plus the locator
which was one of the marketing things cradle scroll wheel for
uh the the channels and uh we implemented the f the the way of putting
the new and revolutionary zapping your favourite channels functionality in the scroll
yeah
zapping you know zapping
maybe it's just a portuguese thing and um yeah that was the result

start s the the start uh to to to programme yeah
not helping


don't have no one to handle that
yeah
so you ha you have like the the base station with um the little button for the where's my remote
the locator function
wicked isn't it






ja

nah
it fell off
w we need we need we need s some more buttons if it would to work on some other stuff but
we we w yeah we could get another version of it that actually works but uh
very co very colf colourful
beep beep beep

yeah
we don't
it's a scroll
yes
we're wicked awesome
yeah
yeah
that was mm hmm
yeah
no
yeah
basically

it was more of a teamwork thing then really leadership based project was
teamwork

yeah
and that's
d you must have very long shirts that's way far down lapel mic
lapel lapel lapel that's almost a crotch mi cr
oh dear oh dear
'cause this is you were using it o upside down still that

use them like that

bunch of new ideas
yeah comfortable headsets would be nice
mm
coulda been worse
mm n no

hooray free coke provided at the cafeteria
who wrote that one

cool
so so so
maybe maybe maybe maybe
bra
mm that's oh that's oh i like it i mean you guys gave me more than i was asking for so i'm happy because we've got some really marketable features in this
yeah i think it's good good good good job
uh pla
i'm ha
it's great that's great it's a great feature
so you can take this ho take this home with you tonight and you can push that and he'll be across town
uh i can see that
yep i like good job
no no
well i mean of course i mean
my my s my suggestion is we're gonna go go to the silvers and blacks like most of the televisions
you know some blend of silvers and blacks
so you're not gonna find my uh my folder up there i gotta do mine up at the board
yeah yeah
so
no it's not in there because i had the computer problem and i i i cou i couldn't create it i couldn't create it in
the powerpoint and i think i've got this really strange cable so what i had
basically going from the powerpoint format is that uh
yeah yeah i like this a lot
is this one of the tests is to see how we can adapt to s changing situations in the in the meeting room
so what we had is we had the method
that's not how you spell method is it
no a 
so this doesn't go so fast this way
and when i speak about method i speak about the marketing of the product huh
and uh to me with this product we got uh we got basically three things to market we've got the features
we have the uh characteristics
and we have the i i don't know what we would call the other part what we call you know the the the
corp corporate
help me
the the corporation stands behind the product okay so the features i think we got the scroll
we've got the uh the locator we've got the durability we've got the dependability
we've got you know the features that make this a unique product um
the characteristics i talk about we have reliability we have comfort we have ergonomics
we have environmentally s sensitive uh and the corporation we're talking about
we're we're a new we're a new company we're wanting to make a name for ourself we're wanting you to
uh find our product so we're gonna give you a good product at a fair price
one thing i would want to to see is uh is can we
can we get a lifetime uh guarantee on this product a normal use guarantee
which means that this product for the for the life of of the life use if
it should have a technical problem that we could re replace it at no cost that was something i would be interested in
um so yeah without uh going into great details we have a we have a product
it has the features and the characteristics and the background i believe to make it marketable i believe at a cost of
of of thirty thirty five to to fifty euros
we're gonna be competitive and we're gonna we're gonna have a market niche
um w
that that would be uh that would be i think a decision best made by corporate um i i m for
my evaluation based on what our competition is i th i think that that we can go after
this and and and go after more of the uh exclusivity sense than the mass market
sense
but i'm sh i'm sure open to to market this in either direction
but you guys came up with a great product and at that cost i think it uh there's nobody else that's putting this this combination of of ingredients together the only limitations i see to this is that we're focused on television only
uh that's the only that's the only drawback i see to this but with all of these other features i think
people c one thing i'm i'm hoping for is people are not gonna even notice there's gonna
be somebody going home and say oh sh this thing doesn't work for my d v d  and my but i like these other things so they keep
it they don't take it back
well one of one of the thoughts that i had is can can this unit be be produced in a way that makes it upgradable
you know uh like like a um a sim card in a in a um in a telephone you know is there a card in th can we make a card and so after
mm hmm but you follow what i'm s i'm s
yeah 'cause if if we can make this unit upgradable then we're yeah but then we talk about changing the warranty concept and everything but that's that was just an idea i had uh to me the only additions
yeah
yep
but anyway that's uh

mm hmm
we've got a we've got a curve and a droop i don't know whether that

ooh
no i think we come up with a with a attractive marketable um product and and concept

yeah well we we we kinda broke we kinda at least adjusted every
every criteria they gave us because we d we still have the the teletext capability in this thing
right we raised the price of it we've added two t new technology to it so you know
you know if this thing flies then we've we've adjusted or broken every every idea they gave us
yeah yeah yeah yeah
but i like i mean when i say we have we had i believe we have room for creativity 'cause w this is we did it
cohesive yeah yes synergistic yeah
yeah
you know you know what they're gonna have on the recording in there from that microphone is your lunch digesting you know th


new ideas f uh for the product or for the the the the environment or what are we ta
oh
well i i mean clearly remote control microphones would be the would be a
nice solution to all these cables but i'm sure that there's there's some justification for these things that i don't know about
and of course i did not have so much fun with my computer this afternoon it's not been uh it's not been cooperating so
well but i don't think that's the
that's avoidable
no
okay
so we need to close this meeting yeah bravo congratulations
s i've got a lot of paperwork to catch up on so let's close this and come back and 'kay
okay welcome everyone to our next meeting i'm busy writing and busy
leading the meeting but um i've prepared a little presentation once
again um or at least an agenda i think uh the biggest part of the presentation
will be uh on your side um we are here at the conceptual design meeting which
is hereby opened um once again i will try to uh write some minutes which i just from the previous meeting
uh placed inside our project folder
which was quite some typing um today we once again have uh three
presentations if i'm right and after that we will take a decision on the remote control concepts and
just as the last time we have forty minutes to accomplish that okay well
i'd say let's start with the first presentation um in the same order as last time okay
well take it away
mm hmm
well business colours i thought it was the the slogan and uh the corporate image so yeah it needs colour
but i don't think you have to make the entire thing in the corporate colour
it must be recognisable
okay thank you
mm
mm hmm
thanks
now our third
team member with his presentation
oh y
so for the older people a more traditional uh form
yeah i guess changing colours will be easier than changing uh
the shape of it

but maybe then both groups won't buy it

mm hmm

yeah we think so too
hmm
so we need a spongy feeling

yeah and we won't include a a pen or something to point hey we we want to do it with our fingers right
yeah
yeah but i think people want to use a remote with with their fingers because th they're used to that and
and maybe we have to add a tissue to remove the grease from all the fingers huh
okay well maybe if i can interrupt you maybe i should uh should show some points on which we uh should take a decision
so we can discuss these points
those points um
energy question mark how how should we uh supply the thing with energy and how are we going to do it with separate docking
station and then put in it uh chip on print and case those are points my uh
coach advised me to discuss here but i hope you have ideas about them
yeah so that's the the the first point we already decided that on the previous meeting
mm hmm
simple rechargeable uh batteries
yeah but how did this how does that with a l c d  screen
you still have a
print plate
mm hmm
yeah well it's a good question it just was in there and i didn't have any information about it but
mm hmm
well you need some kind of c p u  i guess
mm hmm because we're projecting projecting the buttons on the l c d  screen
yeah
yeah but that's what we want
mm hmm
yeah yeah you have a fancy design then right away so
okay so
yeah but i wrote it down
what about the user interface there are also some some questions uh about the concepts i think you have some ideas on that you you showed your drawing
mm

everybody's searching in his data
yeah well i think we have we don't have to decide about that now how where we will put the buttons just the
concepts
yeah well we just heard about the new uh technology huh
mm hmm
yeah maybe at the bottom where you can can hel hold it with you hand that there's also a microphone uh
over there
yeah yeah
yeah well maybe just in the the spot you just pointed out
because i think it should be in a in an important position where people can see it because it is the the unique uh idea of our remote huh the the speech control
well maybe where the one hand
but are we talking about the button or about the microphone yeah because a microphone is very small thing but you can make it look like it's big so as its its really an important function of the remote

so well uh type supplements
anything yeah well we already s discussed that huh the the l c d  and
mm hmm
and i think i would it would make even more fancy because you have another interesting thing on the side which you can touch and
yeah
okay well there's our five minutes uh warning um any more uh questions about about the design or the user interface or different components everyone
everybody think they can can
work for that is there a standard colour
yeah
but still silver and black are well silver is new but also traditional so uh
yeah w what about a yellow thing i mean it
could be ugly but it's definitely fancy
mm hmm
yeah i would think about colours like uh red yellow green blue just
yeah
mm hmm maroon yeah
okay so
who's pinging you are pingin okay i thought we okay so uh that wraps it up everybody
knows uh what to do well i wrote it down here i wrote it down here what to do um the next meeting
is once again in thirty minutes um here are the individual actions and especially notice
that uh the industrial designer and the user interface designer are going to work together on a prototype
drawing on a smart board and of course to all four of us uh specific instructions will be
emailed by our personal coach
well i i'd say just wait uh for email and uh find out i don't know okay well that was what i had to say uh
final thoughts from anyone or we're finished okay well thank you very much
mm alright



hmm

it's a colour



no



you can put the r  and r 

alright
i will go next

alright so i thought a little bit about the interface uh how it should look and
uh uh we uh determined that will not be no buttons but only an l c d  screen so i had
to uh look on that and the design is therefore based on what we just uh uh
thought of
uh first there are some new findings and new technology for speech recognition and this is that uh
um uh uh you you ask you give a question through through the device and it answers you
and they already uh put this in an in a coffee maker and so that it you say uh good morning uh
coffee maker and it says t says to you back good morning joe or what's your name this uh and
there's an easy way to uh program that uh you say record into the device into the speaker and then
you say the question and three seconds later you say the answer and then when you say the question it gives you the answer
um perhaps it's useful perhaps for because people um lose the remote they can yell uh remote
where are you and calls or something and perhaps we could uh implement that and
then i have to go out of the presentation because i tried to make some kind of a
a idea of how it should look like but i can't draw so uh don't make too much of it
i tried to uh the l c d  screen i tried to sort of to draw i thought uh at least uh
the icon for the volume i don't know if there is an icon for the program but yeah
so uh and then the buttons above and uh below the and the and the mute
button also recognisable as an icon
um
i forgot that one i thought i forgot something but uh and uh and uh
the numbers that should be a bit larger i think it's not really on scale and and so forth um
an options button and i thought the the button for teletext apar uh apart because
it's not really options i think it's uh options is the settings of the remote and of the t v  and that kind of uh thing
so could call it settings or something but this is a bit uh how i thought it and
uh the l c d  uh somewhere on the remote perhaps we could be more curvy the remote perhaps should
so that it's better in your hand or something uh but uh and and uh a microph microphone for the speech uh recognition if we want to implement that
uh and then uh if you press the op options button now we have an example of
and then you should get the other options with what what you could do and that you could do with something like this
this and uh it's also uh i thought think we discussed uh earlier
that uh older people don't really want to use uh these extra settings and older people a also don't
really want to use this uh th this kind of option menus so they want to u use one button and then something
happens and not choose with uh this kind of uh and you could put in a an a really s
little scrolling device on the side of your uh remote so you could scroll scroll uh across these uh things
that's an option and that was my uh finding dinge
yeah

grass green
let's build it into a sponge
it was one remote i think different colours

you could you could uh change the colours that was also the idea i don't know which shape you should should take but
yeah
perhaps you could find something in the middle round but square
yeah
uh i i if you do it uh uh square with round corners but a little uh in the middle of it uh i do you know what i mean
wait like like this uh a bit
so it's a bit square but it's also a bit uh
round
so but then
same sides
but that's uh
yeah but that's also how other remotes are shaped so that's uh but perhaps that's a good thing so that's easy to use people know the
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah

swords
yeah
but that's easily to do with the colour i think
that's easy to do with the colours i think
yeah
yeah
yeah think uh also in between
i don't think you should be able to mould it but
yeah
bit like this kind of rubber this uh
but it's quite hard this
yeah

i don't think it's rubber
uh did you have something about uh
so we should first decide about shape i think which uh then you can fit the l c d  screen in it and can decide uh

yeah it it's supposed to be bit s bit s bit yeah

ooh
yeah
but if you pu now you can put your hand there and then you won't touch the screen perhaps that's best
but not on the screen because yeah that's uh that's an idea
looks a bit like a game boy now
you always touch it yeah
yeah
y you could include a pen
yeah o yeah if they think it's handy to use a pen
yeah i think this uh this is a good size for the screen i don't know how how large the actual remote should be but a little bit like this or something
yeah
i think energy were batteries and then uh and uh yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah just like with the telephone
but it should be th i think normal batteries not not like two or two uh
yeah
yeah
um what was with the chip on print

yeah


it's rubber yeah but but a hard rubber like this or softer rubber or yeah
it bounces back from the floor where you throw it yeah yeah this in different colours
yeah it's a bit but i think it should be a bit longer perhaps
yeah i think so too
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah that's a good idea
yeah alright
and then


yeah you can uh it's pretty easy but
and
yeah i had what i just uh i should again
i miss a few buttons but
well
at least uh what we should also have on i just remembered um a menu to go back through the first uh
if if you touch options you can't go back to this uh right away now this
i don't know i think it's
i don't know i i thought it was uh easier to handle this way but i don't know what they think
would you like the the buttons horizontal or v vertical
th
right well if we make it like this i think if you
put it like this
yeah
yeah but i think i wou
i think that's a matter of what you're used to i think i would put a plus and a min uh here and then the p  in the mid in the middle and the sound uh in the middle


almost
yeah but i think when you are holding it you could press the minus and the plus and with the other finger the minus and the plus
yeah but i think yeah i don't know perhaps i have some examples i don't know
that's me but i'm going to look if i've got some examples 'cause perhaps you should choose what's most often used the 'cause they can use that better yeah
i
here is our here are uh
i don't really know
yeah
yeah but but i mean if it's usually plus or min above each other or next to each other on a normal remote
w what's what's usual or normal yes i'm looking here but here's it's below here also and now here's here's next to each other
i think it's it's a
yeah
i think the the the volume was usually uh above each other because you go higher and down and the the pay the the the program is next to each other because you would go further and back
that's how it's is usually when i look here
that's what i see

i don't know
yeah
this concept is in the actual design but you should know where you would place a
and the speech uh shall we implement that or uh
yeah but then you should also find a place you could if you do it like this you could put it in a corner or something you can talk into the corner yeah
yeah
but
yeah that's also
so in the middle or something
but you should uh decide where you want to put it right
you could p you could put it in a logo of the company
yeah
yeah so where do you want to put it
yeah actually it does because it you can you can find it better if you use it
it's a way for you to uh
so it makes more sense just 'cause other remotes don't have that
about a microphone there is no button
yeah
yeah

alright
any more uh
yeah
yeah

yeah

um yeah yeah the the young people do like uh scroll uh yeah
or at least yeah i don't know if it's really the scroll but the menu they like most and i think you can never get through a menu great with a scroll uh
but you have it's f uh we have five or four or something
yeah
yeah it's also different
you should you should have a black one because uh i think black is standard
but if you want to be different then uh
silver
silver rubber
but yeah
yeah
yeah
just all kind of colour
yeah
and and do we have to have a normal black one or uh
is it

yeah
well i don't know what to do but
ooh
right
yeah
but do we have to we'll work together but do we have to stay here or do we
right
yes okay
yeah i think
no
yeah
so we have to keep talking english now

w sure
okay uh welcome you all components design um uh
first of all uh i would like to uh uh accommodate some of those uh things i uh uh elaborate some
of the things i did i i elaborated on the concept what should be um
uh said about uh the components uh its properties and what kind of materials should we use to uh to make uh one of those r remote controls
uh well first of all i've uh d subtracted some of the components that is that are used uh
are w w um you know from what uh the remote control's formed uh first of
all the case the case the surrounding of the of the the remote control i would like to uh
give you an idea of uh how i thought about
giraffe's gone now okay um the case was is made from rubber i suppose there's one of the
because when you use a remote control a lot of people uh will uh will uh
drop their remote control and they break uh becau the uh titanium was also an option but uh
it's a very expensive material uh rubber is i think uh the best suitable uh material
uh to use uh for our uh
for our remote control um it's poss it's also possible to uh create fancy
colours with rubber uh rubber l makes it easy to uh to to it lets lets itself colour
uh titanium uh you have to paint it and with that uh it's possible to scratch it or
uh yeah make it ugly uh rubber uh the total uh piece of rubber
that's sor uh that's that's used uh to make the case is uh the same colour so if you scratch it it's
still the same colour perhaps uh it's a little bit damaged but it's a very strong material
um i h i had an idea single covered uh curved sorry single curved uh so it's t two dimensional i think it's uh it's best to draw oh green
uh
new blank
okay
let's make it uh black
okay i thought of an idea like this
oh that um delete
blank okay
so it also looks nice when it's on your table so you get uh it doesn't lay flat down on the table but it's c it's stands
side view yes it's side view so uh i i'm not technically good at th three d  modelling but um
uh it's just an idea i had so it's uh it's very uh so its also looks nice when it's on the table um
the graphical user interface and the buttons uh we also thought about that already uh i thought about uh the l c d 
touch screen which is uh is easy to clean too
one of the great uh advantages of the l c d  screen you just use some or uh another uh cleaning
uh uh cl some cleaning stuff and um it should be made of strong plastic and it should
be bright well i already uh s uh explained some properties of that material and i think
uh well we also we almost concluded about that uh this should uh be uh our
uh button component so uh
uh that's all about uh the buttons uh the batteries uh we also thought about that already uh will be chargeable
with uh uh an option for a mount station so you can uh put the uh the remote control
in a mount station so its charges itself up instead of uh plugging it in or something like that questions
okay
and they should be long lasting not uh not be empty uh in about uh two minutes or uh thirty minutes or forty
minutes of use and next step is the chip uh th the component that's
uh makes or transmits the signal to the television uh there was an option to
use s a rather simple chip but i think uh because uh of our uh highly
uh requiring uh requirements there should be an advanced chip in it with uh also
the ability to uh facilitate speaker speech recognition uh which unfortunately
is still in a test phase so uh there should be some more uh investigation on that side
uh my personal preferences uh i also overheard in the last meeting that there shou we should
use uh our own business colours that was correct wasn't it okay i think
they are rather boring for um for use with rubber
okay they should be m sh they should be in mind wasn't it
okay so it d it doesn't says uh to uh have the slogan
okay okay well that's possible of course we could make a little r  and r  on the top of the
machine uh so they are pretty boring i suggest because just the availability with rubber to make
fantastic colours uh and also in a lot of possible colours so it's possible to make very
uh fancy uh remote controls which peopl uh who people
in which people will find they're uh interesting and uh will buy uh them faster when
they look at the same old grey or black uh colours uh s as i said uh before
rubber is uh is impossible to damage severely imp instead of uh of
course you can break it when you you when you break it in s for example with a pair of scissors or something like that but i
if you drop it it's not uh broken uh right away s instead of using uh plastic hard plastic or uh titanium
and i personally liked uh the single curved uh remote control because it yeah it makes sense okay well that's all about my uh my findings


mm
mm
mm



oh my god

not just a p  oh okay
 



ah
mm hmm
yep
oh okay yeah
oh yeah
mm
okay
go danny go danny

fruity fruity
mm okay


mm
okay
changing just the shape of the uh remote control
yeah s round corners but s but square yeah
yeah
yeah i know what you mean kind of like a
yeah
kinda like a beer glass yeah
i know what you mean
it's also easy to to have to to put in your hand
yeah
will recognise that's as a remote control uh when i saw your d oh
huh
yeah kinda like old cars uh

let's put it all together

uh

yeah
soft rubber

yeah i know what you um
it should shouldn't be
uh
spongy
yeah
ding ding
um i also s uh can't help but notice that you uh used an you had a remote control and the l c d  screen was uh rather small um
 
this was your size but i think it should be larger
yeah three quarters so uh so you don't have to put your oh
uh new blank
so uh when you get this uh
uh kinda like this
or should it be larger larger because you want to put your hands you want
yeah your thumb here
yeah
because when you put your f yeah but if yo if you make the the l c d  screen as large as the remote control itself uh you'll you'll always get some you yeah going to be very greasy and stuff
yeah you don't want it too small how yeah how large
yeah they have thick fingers but if you wanna make it in international japanese uh people got uh rather small hands
and we got these large
zoom opt ah yeah of course yeah you can make it larger to to uh to uh with accompanying uh greater fields to push the button
your fingers yeah you don't want uh because if you lose the pen uh if you lose the pen uh you can't use

yeah you can do whatever uh any uh cloth
sure
the docking station
w
yeah
i kinda like your
yeah you got some uh some of those uh uh wireless uh mice mouse computer mouse
kinda like those kind of batteries
yeah
the chip on print um
uh you gotta f yeah i think so chip on print with a with a simple uh a sim not a simple but a
we also discussed that didn't we
uh
beg your pardon
yeah sure of course yeah
well uh chip on print i think what they mean uh with the regular rubber buttons that you got uh it's always clear
for the remote control when you press uh a certain button but when you got a l c d  screen
with no uh with not the buttons are not always on the same place for example if you enlarge a button
or if you got several options uh appearing on your screen uh the co ordinations aren't always
the same when you got a regular button th the button of stand by is always on the same place and you got on the and on the
yeah

i suppose so
it is a simple c p u  but it doesn't
yeah because it has to uh b
yeah but it the the remote control has to know whether you're in a settings menu or just uh you just want to turn up the volume
so it has to have some kind of a
calculation unit or c p u 
to know uh in which state you are and uh which button you are pressing in at the right moment
yeah
and a touch screen makes it uh possible to uh to get the co ordination of your finger on the screen and the case yeah we already discussed the case we wanted to make it from rubber and uh
uh hard rubber i think that's the easy to ha uh to to uh
yeah yeah sure look
d
it's our main target

well and how about my idea uh of making it um
with one single curve
so i
because it's a gadget and you want to show it off of course
uh
because it yeah
yeah
it's a lot easier
so so you got uh did you write that down uh got a single curved uh rubber
f uh fancy coloured remote control
yeah
sorry
depends on the screen if you make the screen vertical it doesn't matter if you make it uh in a rectangle
i so it's it's it's it's
square

oh okay

uh
take your time

w
we'll leave that to the usability engineering then
yeah
consistency
yeah
so not how much n not how often it's used but
uh

yeah it does it doesn't really matter but
uh

okay um
let's cut to the chase
okay well le
yeah
interface yeah
technologies uh
yeah makes it possible to
mm
not even necessary because a lotta you can make a very sensitive microphone so it makes it possible to uh just put it arou uh underneath it or on the on the bottom of the uh remote
yeah
right
but that's not import i think that's not im very important because yeah it doesn't matter where the microphone is
ah okay sure okay well tha
underneath
indeed it shouldn't be uh very uh visible
yeah sure why no
yeah but it doesn't makes it uh any more fancy because you get to see uh
uh
yeah okay

okay well put it there i don't mind that doesn't doesn't really matter
okay so

interface type
the l c d  yeah uh supplements well the supplement is to yeah

hey
use the scroll yeah i think so too so why not on on side
fast yeah
so if you've got a settings if you
yes
you have a lot of options because when you use yeah you get w when you use uh the settings menu for example to look up some uh
uh some channels on your uh on your television you should scroll scroll down uh on a menu
which probably does not fit on your screen so then it's uh very handy to to scroll down
you make just a rubber just like uh on your mouse or just put it on the side and it's very easy to use
yeah yeah
yeah
okay what's the standard colour
i i you got you got different colours but you should have a standard colour
black with the with the yellow uh
just a regular uh remote colour and then have uh different covers uh to use
silver yeah
you see a lot of t uh silver televisions
yeah y i think it's better to
yeah th yeah that's right but if you use uh silver uh rubber s silver rubber isn't fancy
when you use titanium silver is fancy but when you use silver rubber it isn't fancy silver has to shine and rubber doesn't shine
especially when it's made of soft rubber like this
you understand
yeah
fruity fruity loops
okay
you ping
well not what to do not what to do look
okay
thin i think we should work
thank you very much
'kay

don't destroy my giraffe

drop it
bright colour fancy colour forward
you have to go t
oh it's a side view

true
no no no no no just looking
mm mm mm next
it's true
p  yeah just a p 

where's where's the button for two
okay
doesn't matter
no
okay

okay i'm going to tell you something about a trend watching the trends from the past years what the people like what the youngsters like what the elderly people liked about shapes colours
material and stuff
'kay
the method i used was
like i told i watched the trends from the past years about colours shapes material they wanted uh from elderly
and young people so we can keep that in mind for designing f uh the device itself
findings i made the most important thing people liked last year was that the remote control should be look
look fancy
the second important thing that w should be if inv in innov innovative okay like the l c d 
screen that's quite innovative so that should be great meeting for this and the third thing is
it should be easy to use i think with only one menu four button channel volume it should also be
enough for easy to use
the personal preferences for the young people they liked fruity colours like uh banana yellow uh strawberry red and stuff
yeah like that the round shapes
and soft material m materials like the rubber it should be soft uh i it should feeling spongy or s sponge bob like things th
elderly people like au colours which y are being seen in autumn like um woods um dark brown red deep reds and stuff they liked square shapes with round edges
and hard materials like wood um titanium they those kind of materials they liked this is a bit like the young peoples like the fruity colours
innovative all the colours you see the blue the red the white the yellow that stuff and then i th i i personally thought the front side of the shape should be something for the youngsters like like
this or something
it's it's a bit like a banana and the colour should be yellow or something and for the elderly people just
plain old because we decided to have two kind of remotes two designs or
was it two colours different colours yeah we should decide whether it's going to be with round shapes i think like
my colleague you said is that's e better or for the elderly people something like
like the ipod or something with round squares simple but
easy to use so that's it
that is my
yeah like the older o older colours i can maybe
yeah
colours th the elderly people
uh
look something like that autumn colours like red brown they liked the wood a lot
so maybe we could give it like wooden loo look look or something in that colour and a bit bit
old school style renaissance medieval kind of things
those kind of yeah those kind of things so you see the big difference between the young people fresh exciting and the old people old and boring
so sorry yeah i think it's it's easier to do in colour than in shape because otherwise we have to get different shapes and colour way easier than yeah the shapes
in material yeah rubber rubber is like i said young people like more soft materials and spongy ones and the old people like plain wood so we have to decide if we're going to use
real hard rubber or soft rubber or something something between that
yeah soft rubber which you can you can feel in it
or no or or wh what's something harder no no no but but you have to like like like a a eraser or something that's the bit you can press it in or something harder
yeah something like this yeah
yeah it's quite hard but you can press it in it's feels kind s spongy
something
no
n n n
are you going to invite sponge bob maybe he can
yeah i think that's the better thing to do

yeah w i think that l c d  screen should be like
yeah three quarter of the of the
yeah the buttons won't get that small when the l c d  screen is

mm hmm
larger i think
yeah becau because you have
yeah okay true true true true
yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah
but it won't get that small because you have how much nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen buttons on the screen
one to zero the two digit
you have to you have to because some fat people with d thick fingers will press three buttons at same time
yeah true but yeah we have we have the zoom option right
yeah
yeah
no yeah
yeah
use a pen you you c you can lose the pen
yeah the fingers yeah
yeah but that that can be with plain soft tissue yeah you can buy those at

maybe it's better to to include rechargeable batteries which you can recharge through the docking station
so if the badg the batteries are dead
then you can re you can uh change them
yeah yeah yeah like those
yep

yeah normal plain you no normal plain batteries you can buy at the supermarket or retail shop yeah
print plate
yeah yeah yeah you always have a print plate
you always have a print plate right always so
i dunno what w what we have to decide about that

yeah okay
but
yeah okay but the p print plate of l  l c d  screen is more advanced than a normal print plate so that that's not of any discussion i think
mm i don't i dunno i don't think that's
yeah yeah okay but i d i i don't know if nor o s it's quite a simple l c d  yeah it's quite a simple l c d  screen i think they don't need that big of c p u 
yeah okay true true
true
yeah
we have different colours
so the shapes is something between the square shapes with round colo corners and a round shapes
no i don't think i think
it's more round than square
so it meets i think it meets more the young people than the older people
yeah that's our target yeah
lower than forty years i think
it was
oh yeah that that i think i thought that was a quite good
yeah
you can put it on your table with the l c d  screen you don't have to put it get it in your hand you can put it next to you and then dive it in and yeah
so
you can't you you can't oh you c you can draw it on your paper and then load it on the
and load it on the the user the server
mm hmm
yeah you have to go back
yeah uh uh
isn't it better to have the sound and the general buttons horizontal
with the minus and the plus i think it's
easier than
yeah

for sound and channel
yeah
i think it's it's easier to have it something like
oh a button uh minus here plus over here
a minus here plus over here
and on here
the other buttons and on here the top
the options and then you have something like uh the p  over here
and the sound
something uh
something like
sh
plus minus plus uh
minus
yeah i think you're going to s you're going to use it with one thumb
who's the usability engineering she is
oh
um
oh i have that those s numbers
or a good watch b
channel selection per hour one hundred and sixty eight volume selection four times an hour
uh
yeah that depends on on on the remote
i think because i have two televisions at home one is horizontal one is vertical so it depends
yeah depends
yeah lower
true
it's got to change
yeah is it is user interface
component
yeah i think it's it's easy for that where are you but then it says i'm here
yeah
yeah a microphone yeah

um i think where it isn't seen
the most
inside
yeah i i between the round of the r 
yeah
yeah okay
yeah
yeah bu but
i think the left s under corner should be the best
where isn't i it isn't most in sight
i think
no actually doesn't
i think i thought the like you said like scroll next to the remote isn't that handy
i think it's better to just up what you'd like to do on the screen if you want to go back you have to back button go back
if you want to choose audio settings you press audio settings and it goes to that s sub menu
yeah you do like it
yeah i think it is is faster becau i think the scroll's easier if you have a lot of options but if you don't have a lot of option then
y
uh huh
yeah okay true
okay

okay no problem
okay
um
no colours are clear shape is clear material is clear
and a standard yeah we don't no we have different colour how many colours are we going to
black yeah black i think is is the standard
dark grey something like this this colour or something
yeah like like yeah or or silver
i think it's better to have silver nowadays
i think you see more silver than black
yeah the the silver black are our main colours yeah i think we have silver black and between those is like i dunno s five colours between them or something
yeah yeah yeah it'll be a banana yellow we have
r red
green wood brown yeah
true
yeah i understand
yeah o of course the fruity colours and the autumn colours like red and brown dark red and brown
no
s tough
we'll be available
no
finished
okay well let's start what are we doing oops

okay okay not doing uh
very good
okay we have presentations so first it's your turn yeah isn't it amazing
industrial designer interface concept

can you go back one page
for the uh menu what do we use for that
we don't have buttons for the menu or we may have to use channel of the volume and channel
okay but uh
you have to put it on the
yeah
yeah but has to be clear that you can use the arrows
mm hmm yes the second one
okay
not too much colours
no it's not flower power
s okay
okay
thank you
so you're next

hmm
no isn't but the l c d  is easy when you use the scroll uh buttons
then you can scroll you see what number and then you push
but then it's not easy to use scroll uh
wheel
if you don't
hmm yes but then yeah then you go one down one up
when you scroll
yeah but like we said before it has to be used on every television so you may not be uh
no the television must do that so
yeah but young people have to have all their uh room
and mostly they are smaller so
most the times that are not advanced televisions
okay
that's important
yeah
maybe you can look how how much it is for the l c d  it's very important
yeah more expensive but how much

oh
okay
okay well thank you next

no it's clear
so now
it's uh ah let's see
now w we have to decide

well we have to decide on the concept so we have to look at
's next components and user interface concept so
now we have to make some concept maybe one of you can paint it on the board
first uh user interface
yes a concept on uh just

yeah but maybe we can paint it uh what do we want
i'll paint okay well
something like this or
shapes or what do we need
yes okay
okay
and you have to
yeah
so it has to be soft
okay
and uh the buttons
buttons
no it won't
but well there one for the sound and one for the channels
uh two scroll uh wheels
that's th that's more difficult
it's better in
but if we don't have a l c d  we don't have a menu
yeah but again maybe th how do we know the t v  can handle it you don't know so there's no menu
no so you can't use it
okay we make two concepts one with l c d  one without l c d 
good concept but
that's one
it's one
two number two

no but when you handle it you put it on and off
it's not good to use
yeah but i'll zap fuck out
no it's not good now second concept one with l c d  one without l c d 
then uh
paint it
one with two scroll buttons and one with without yeah
uh one with a with a menu and one without a menu and the one with with a menu has an l c d 
unbelievable do i have to do everything blank you have
not so difficult
uh that's the menu there for the l c d  screen
you have to
for the menu
mm hmm one
that way and one
that way
so
then it depends on the cost s on and off
when it's not too big just like a a phone
yes okay

very good
is it better
when you uh the menu you have to go there there there there
yeah okay that's that's the outside but now the first the buttons
sorry
mute and the other
yeah not so difficult
but how do you wanna solve it
yeah but on the menu that's not uh easy
then you go down you switch you go into the right you switch you go down
yeah
a joystick
yeah but is it uh
does that break a joystick or a small one just like in a laptop
mean it's better but how expensive it is
oh why do i pay you for
um well um
better ideas
for the young peoples i think scroll button's good
so
think we have to keep them
yeah but is it that's not expensive than uh joystick is better
a small one
no just like in a
a laptop small round
then it's
not so big
oh the sh yeah but then you can you have to use t with one hand
so
maybe if it's possible it's not too expensive i think a joystick is better a small one
so please look at it

yeah we i think you get it
so after this meeting you have half an hour to uh fix it
yes
your problem not mine
okay so do we have other concepts
then for the components
we use a normal battery
then it's
ch cheapest way i think
no no kinetic kinetic is uh ch makes it more expensive so we use a normal battery
chip depends on the l c d 
scroll
yeah and uh we if you use the l c d  we have to
yes okay so depends on the l c d  and the scroll okay
okay so uh the shapes of the
design
depends on the l c d  and but
it has to be small
i think
if you have pistol it l c d 's not easy
y y yeah but
if you use a phone
k yeah but but then you have it like th if you have pistol you have it so and the screen is
well then you have to keep it this way to look at the screen
yeah
no no no
yeah but then you look forward and then you can y
n well if you have to look at it
then it goes like this
if th n well
yes of course that's good good but the um it may not break
okay if that's possible
okay
yeah of course okay
then this is the design and the buttons are on the next page so depends on the cost so um we have one minute
i think no more seven
next meeting thirty minutes so hurry up
you two stay here paint it
now you have to
so
i think it's clear check your mail so
it has to be ready in the next meeting so
next meeting is called the detailed design so
everyth everything has to be ready
thanks for your attention
hmm

oh
mine oh great
uh

yes well uh let's uh talk about the interface uh concept
uh first i'll uh i'll uh discuss the buttons we just chose uh show you some samples uh
uh discuss some colours and design maybe already and uh my personal preferences
well we chose the power button to switch the television on and off the bu uh the mute button to switch the
volume on and o on and off the channels buttons one to nine and uh off uh uh zero to nine
and the uh button to choose uh higher channels than nine
uh the volume and channel quadrants uh left and right up and down arrows to uh do the volume and channel and the menu menu button to man manipulate the l c d  uh display
um i found some uh interesting uh uh samples
examples um well uh what's pretty standard is uh that it's that they're all pretty
uh uh high uh
yeah yeah large and and and pretty thin and uh and long um power buttons are mostly at the top
uh left or right
um well we see the the the same uh
arrows like there and uh
yeah well arrow b buttons can be blue
and what's interesting is the the the icons on the buttons some buttons have icons like
the play and stop but we don't use that but uh these we we have to choose the right icons or or letters
uh this is the v  for volume but they're both uh a v  so it's it's not really very uh
clear what's the function of that
um
yeah so that's
uh well
yeah i thought that was our uh idea so uh how
like this or or this
and that the menu button is okay
yeah okay uh so the
the icons on the arrows as well you mean
yeah
uh well that's something to uh think about
okay
um well i don't i don't know if we have to discuss this already or in the next uh meeting but
uh as we have to uh to to design the the case and the whole uh remote
control in our uh our our corporate uh company uh uh colours and the logo
i would uh recommend a yellow case
uh round edges the logo at the bottom and uh well maybe each each uh set of buttons uh has uh has his own colour so it's good uh recognisable k so i think
uh no not too much but uh no no no but this has to be has to be trendy and uh and
uh yeah so good uh good icons on the buttons and uh and big buttons is my uh personal uh
opinion
that was that

hmm


no
mm yes
what


mm
yeah

but but i that's the only scroll uh button on it then
yeah okay but but how
yeah how
okay
mm
yeah

mm hmm
and you can and you can uh make the the power button as a trigger like uh

just to uh
oh like a
yeah


but if you put push the the menu button
yeah wh what
yes but you don't know which of the scroll buttons you have to choose
yeah
mm hmm


mm yeah

yeah
it's uh
or you can uh
turn it inside
but that's
no that's true
okay

cookie
ah pinball





huh


uh maybe i'll have something in my uh presentation and you will see it

i'm next okay

yes no here we go
uh at first we will uh i will f uh say something about what younger people want our uh group w uh w uh
we want to uh sell our remote controls to and then i'll discuss what my
opinion is about the costs about uh what battery is in it what kind of buttons also
first uh the younger people they want like soft mat uh materials and primary
colours like totally yellow totally red uh so it's visible
uh the shapes are curved and round like uh you also said
maybe it's nice to uh get a remote control not like all the other ones straight and uh flat
and long but to give him the shape of your hand so you it's easier to use or something like that
but that's just an idea and then
i'll have to discuss about the costs uh of all the things for the remote control the
battery there are few options uh i think the best option is to use uh the basic battery
so everybody can buy it uh at the at the supermarket
or use uh a k uh kinetic battery like uh within a watch when you
uh shake it a few times it it's loaded uh the the form of the remote
control i think it's also nice have it curved
and maybe like it's hand shaped uh so uh you take it here in your hand and here are
the buttons uh material you use plastic hard plastic uh because
uh it won't have to burst uh like in the in one time and also rubber because the younger people
like that what we see in the research
uh the push buttons we have one new thing uh discovered it's a scroll push uh thing like
a mouse maybe it's uh easy to use uh for the channels when
you want to go m move up you just scroll up and click on the button if you wanna see the next
uh if you wanna see that channel
and also for the mouse uh for the volume it's also uh easy to use just scroll a bit up
scroll a bit down and that's also easy just w when you have a thing like this
and you get it here you can do it with your thumb
and with your l left hand you can uh push the buttons uh if you push uh channel one you can see channel one
the electrics um with a scroll push uh button we must use
regular uh chips there are also uh simple chips they are uh cheaper
um but then we have just a basic uh uh remote control
and i think there are a lot of those uh things and people won't buy it any more they have seen enough of it
and you have also advanced um chips but that's with the l c d  uh screen
and the costs will increase a lot more and i think our budget is too low to use
and an l c d  and the chip who is more expensive
and maybe it's also then uh thoughtful if we u uh use uh
as um different kind of uh shapes for the for remote control that
we then use the primary colours like you get a yellow uh remote control red one blue one
et cetera
you have any more questions about this
i think the main thing is we look at the costs and not too basic not a basic remote control who everybody already has
not with an l c d  no
yeah
but then what i say the costs will uh get a lot higher
th then you'll see it on the television
yeah but l when you see a menu uh on the television it's like you see uh one to twenty you go uh uh s scroll up and push number tw twenty

mm hmm yeah i think the younger people will have newer televisions which
can provide our uh remote control
yes
but that won't be a problem
i think
no but then we'll get to the regular uh remote controls and i think what i said everybody
has them uh has them already and they go to a uh supermarket and buy them uh for two euros
uh and ge and get the most cheapest uh thing and i think we must look further
to uh to devel d develop something news
i got it on my screen and it was uh higher but i don't know uh how much higher
that's true
but then we'll i think we must discuss who uh what will be better if we have a better shape
of the um remote control or better options on it with a scroll menu
a w scroll thing and a l c d  and then a flat um remote control or a more
hand shaped remote control with scroll without l c d 
i can uh look on my uh

uh
note that the push button requires a simple chip chip a scroll wheel requires minimally
a regular chip which is a higher price range the display requires a advanced chip
which is which in turn is more expensive than the regular chip
doesn't say
that's from my manufacturing division

yes


changing covers
nope
uh uh uh
how w how we how we make it uh

shouldn't we first discuss about like what w we all
yeah but if i paint with

more like something
m like yeah i can't dr i can't draw it uh i have to i'm not a designer it's more three d  like um when you have
a part here this is the remote control and then you have something like
th this under it so it's easier to get it like this it's like a gun
and it has to be soft yeah
so you can squeeze in it and sorry buttons on top of it and here
the scrolling you can do it with your thumb

but now we use one scroll button and the other one is here one till uh uh zero till nine and the b

yeah or two buttons
if uh 'kay c if we do if we use one then we'll have just a switch on it and you'll just switch it and now it's the sound to switch back
with the menu uh button and then you also can scroll uh scroll in it just not like all the other ones with
uh this thing and uh here an arrow here an arrow here an arrow here an arrow because uh from
h hundred uh remote controls ninety nine have it
uh then we have it on the t v  the menu

i don't know
it's like some sort of uh teletext option but we don't have teletext
and if we put an l c d  thing on it then the costs will uh be much higher
'kay
but you all like this kind of thing uh
with the scroll button and and this one has to be soft and this has to be harder because when it falls it mu mu must not burst or some kind of rubber around it
yeah yeah ah that's nice here trigger


paint it with the scroll thing on like this
so
draw it
but is it easy to use when you have it on your left side and
separate more separate h yeah
yeah on the left a scroll button and on the right a scroll button
but would it be easy to use then if it's like you have a big uh

i also think this concept is not what the young people were looking for they were like round curves uh different uh
okay okay okay
mm hmm

personally i think two scroll buttons uh aren't easy to handle
with the switch button
no like uh
oh you mean like that uh then you can also have like uh th um
yeah and joystick i think
yeah like in a laptop s uh s some sort of thing a little bit bigger with easier thi
i don't know

or no scroll uh things just a shape and no no it won't work
yeah uh huh
or a remote control more like joystick
a small one like this like a nintendo uh k
playstation thing
no no no i mean the the shape of the remote control just like a playstation thing
yeah

no that's okay i got
uh they're not uh
in details it's more expensive or less expensive huh
then i have to come with it
i got my personal costs i i don't i don't know the costs

then i'll uh make something up
yeah or the or the kinetic uh with normal battery yeah i think it's uh yeah more expensive yeah
okay
depends on the scroll
if we use a scroll then we have the uh regular chip if we don't use a scroll then we can use the simple chip and that's
uh the most expensive yeah
if we yeah if we no okay scroll wheel so i have this so it will be uh the advanced chip or the uh regu uh or the regular chip
or shall we just put it on the pistol thing and then just put also on l c d  on it
just use your thumb
if you yeah i use my thumb
yeah
if you have a joystick on
no if you have like uh an uh uh a ni a uh playstation uh game controller and you move up f forward down left then you have uh just yeah a little bit curved it's not just uh straight

that's how we use it that's why they make joysticks like that i think
yeah
'kay here's our designer
yeah
yeah why not
it's for the younger people it's something new
now we put uh rubber around it
hard plastic uh the shape and around it hard uh around it rubber and the uh the hand shape is also rubber
huh
this is something new
costs are okay
oh that's us together

yes
'kay
bye bye
mm ah hey ah now i have my screen back too
yeah
yeah
very interesting

large a lot a lot of buttons buttons
yeah
yes
okay

okay
mm hmm
hmm
yep
yeah
but thi i uh this is with an l c d  no not

uh can you give an indication in b uh in the cost difference between uh the chip with l c d  or without
'cause it i think if we have an l c d  it will also sell a lot better
and that might uh bring back the costs uh
huh
'kay
my turn
mm so
so
yeah so my uh presentation is about trend watching uh i did some trend watching it's very important to uh keep up with latest trends 'cause if you don't you won't sell
so well how we did do that uh well we made an investigation of the market by trendwatchers they uh
watch in uh cities like uh paris and milan of course well known for their uh
trend uh trends
and well uh what did you find uh we have two groups young and trendy and the old and rich well th and the young and trendy
they uh they starting to like uh fruit and vegetables
uh as a theme for n uh clothes shoes and also uh products
and um material that should feel have uh a spongy feeling and to get a feeling for what it is uh here is an image of it
then the old and rich they like uh dark colours and simple recognisable shapes and um they also like uh familiar material uh especially wood now another picture
to get a feeling for this
well uh then already come to my personal preferences we uh aim at the younger market so we should also
be uh look at their uh trends however with trends it's always if there's it's now
it it it might last one year and next year it be uh can be totally different
and i think we want to sell our product for longer than one year so we m must not just only look at what the trend is now as it might be totally different next year so that's uh one thing to keep in mind

yeah
any questions

yeah

mm
can make several uh concepts
we have this and we had the idea of an um a more uh uh uh like sh in the shape of your hand
yeah i i i uh yes

yeah
a g mm
yeah
and i if we go to uh

but if we have uh a me yeah if we have a menu uh how do we uh choose other options
yeah
uh uh
uh uh


yeah


yeah

m uh yeah maybe it's better if the uh scroll wheels are um more separate yeah like you have the menu button in between uh
yeah
think we have we have now two buttons missing the uh um
the mute button
we have two buttons missing the mute button and um the to to uh have to uh numbers
okay but uh

okay


and on the l c d  how much it costs uh it costs extra


yeah
yes


uh
uh yeah but
yeah
if you
if we have uh then something standing here with the l c d 
um yeah

i can't see the
but uh the easy of uh th the ease of use wasn't uh the most important uh aspect of it
uh for us it's about to sell it uh


one
no you have more you have still ten


yeah
what
okay
okay
see you at the next meeting
yeah

yeah well uh i was expecting to get yeah though and i did did make it in time but it just just 'cause all the leaves and things um the stra the trains weren't stopping at the stations so they decided to put speed restrictions on
yep yeah 'cause apar apar apparently p uh i'm not sure um the and they're bussing
people into station have particular problems on it 'cause it's on a 'cause it's on a hill or something um so i had so i had to bus people in from like stations
either side yes yes but yeah at l at least it was speed
restrictions instead of like trains flying past into barriers and things so
oh f yeah
okay





well you know apa pa apart from apart all apart from waiting for the get get camtasia sorted out
yeah i haven't i haven't added anything to the wiki recently so uh 'cause i've we've been been working on trying to get the x m l 
stuff working so some the ba basically they only had to how the dom works um so i can do the next so i can ge generate d d f  files
huh um so so th yeah so just just been reading through documentation that's what i was doing the end of last week um just so i know how it all works
and figuring out the best way to do things um but i'm at the moment i've i've been playing with the dom stuff
in mozilla uh 'cause i 'cause uh ju just so at least i can see how it works with the h t m l  pages so i can generate um
the x  so i can generate x h t m l  stuff and see how it all works there just 'cause to just see how things work in
that um and
it well thing is that the a  the a  well the a p i  is standardized by the w  three c  so the a p i  is stan is standard between everything um
uh or
yeah yeah yeah it is it it just has a couple of yeah yeah um well yeah but if they will b but
it doe does look like it does does that this is and things like that so i was doing the is anyway um it's ju it's just that that's
that's quite a quick way to just to get into how how works because i can just quickly generate quickly generate a web page and then just add and take
yeah add things to and take things away and don't see exactly what's going on at the time so
oh well just 'cause x h t m l  has a nice you know you got browsers there so you can actually see you can actually see directly what's what's going on
yeah well i'll i'm using x h t m l  uh to deter that's uh all all the web pages are x h t m l  so it's x m l  just with the h t m l  d t d 
yeah ju ju ju just ba just 'cause we haven't uh we haven't f haven't quite finalised the um the g d f  format so just just well just
yeah yeah so all have to do is just change it change that sort of thing so it's uh yeah yeah
yeah yeah
yeah yeah but
um that what what what what i'm doing the moment i'm looking through the s the uh stuff that robin put on the wiki to say what's you know what
what we need in the in the t um in the output format for the for the task you know so what what you're what you're gonna do the analysis on
um so i'm making sure that i can take get that information out of the g d f  as it st state of the moment and if i find something that you can't get out
of it then i can add that to the add that to the g d f  format so
yeah yeah
yeah well the
well i'm i'm i'm ju try i'm making sure that the g d f  format we've got at the moment will d will output say well i've output
old analysis that that robin's looking for um so so i'm using that as a way to to get into ha ha using the dom things as well
um so yeah so at the moment i'm looking at act actually the g d f  format itself um and then to generate the g d f  format
i'm gonna be taking stuff out of the gest analyser um and then using a dom parser to generate uh x m l 
output from the gest analyser
uh no no but uh i'll when and out of the output of the gest analyser does does do some of the processing already which is what i'll m plan
to use that as the basis for it 'cause that already that already picks up like target regions things like that so you get so so it knows whether you're looking
at a part or whether you're looking at target area or what or whatever um so yes as long as it got that in it somewhere
so it's just a matter of pulling that out and put that into the um into the g d f  stuff
yep
yeah um bu
yeah yeah i um i think the o the only thing i've got left to do before the experiments can be run is get s is get the check camtasia works um now i've got camtasia running on machines and i think they're set up correctly but i can't test it until we get the microphones working microphones
'cause


ah well he must some these days anyway isn't it so so
yeah so we all got off easy
yeah ah well ca i can easy i can easy get to mapl uh to maplin i know where it is off i used to live there so i know i know where i used to live here i'm a geek i know where i know where maplin is
yeah
well i suppose i could gi i could give you a call on the way in tomorrow and if th not bi it's not been in your in your f um pigeon hole i can easy go off the train and early and just pick 'em up from there
right yeah well i'll make sure i make a i'll make sure of i got the f the phone number in my phone so i can call them
all true true um uh it's dalry road isn't it um

yep
i t i'd say you don't be
mm
yeah yeah screen shots yeah yeah
oh
hmm

well i'm i'm using dice machines if he wants to pop in for five minutes the the windows machine is free for him at the moment


yeah
yeah i mean i considering we get an email from uh the i think it got sent through saying that he'd updated the the whatever it was on the wiki so you do he'd he'd uploaded a ne a new zip file and overwritten the old one so
yep
yep
yeah
yeah
yeah well when the whole thing was if it was gonna run a trial that'll give you some some screen shots to work with and then it'll just be a matter of adding new video f mouse movements or whatever so
uh have a look if you th anything prob any problems with it um think there's a wiki page up for that f for that piece of uh for yeah for that thing so if if you just put just put whatever recommendations bugs on that page and i'll work through them read 'em as and when i can
yeah
yeah yeah um
yeah
and like these yeah i mean i've used the software and there's not that hard i mean uh
yeah

if
yeah so well i can't imagine the building the building the mold is gonna be that hard i mean i can easily just well however many thousands are on that uh
dutch web site you found just you know pick pick some of them redo them in in the ja in the j c d 
format that's yeah it's pretty mechanical i can easily d easily do that so but it's a matter
of choosing which ones you need to do which i guess you have to do well yeah yeah well you need to
you you and marloes need to sort out yeah

um i don't think don't think so i mean uh so the the major thing i've gotta d got to do is get this camtasia sorted out so just waiting for the batteries for that um if robin's not worried i'm not worried um
um p
yeah yeah 'cause i'll go gotta finalise that format and then once that's done i've gotta start looking at the analysis side of it and that's
yeah um
yeah yeah i think yeah no the the analysis i think the analysis will take a little while i don't think it's gonna take that long to get its stuff sorted out it's gonna be how to display it and all that sort of stuff uh whatever makes it easiest for you to do um but once w
hmm

yeah yeah um yeah so i still gotta work on the gest analyzer and turn that into the t into a g d f  outputter
um and uh oh yeah and i'll i can have a look at the model builder as well um 'cause one thing i'm thinking about is w we're looking
at the the part building pa type stuff uh and it might worth seeing if we can add a little part builder thing into the
um model builder um just just the ju i just gotta tidy tidy up some the code for generating the parts anyway the j c t 
um parts from from s v g s yeah
yeah yeah but i'll wanna have a qui have a quick look and see see how easy it is to add this things to it 'cause um if if i can use
it to generate um um the rotsym angle for example and the rotation symmetry stuff for it which is what was causing
the bugs uh before um so if i if i can use the model builder to automatically do that then that would sa that would save quite a bit of work and it'll
d save a few bugs so
no it's uh it's just something you gotta remember once the part's been built so um
yeah yeah well i'm not not not pl not planning do much on that it's just
yeah i mean i've i've already i've already got this yeah
yeah other i saw saw saw saw something about map task like little further down my task list
right
right yeah well that that's that's just x m l  to x m l  to x m l  isn't it turning g d f  and what other bits into n x t 
yeah yeah
right right um yeah 'cause that's the yeah o other than you have from what i've heard about it is both x m l 
so the the programming side of it doesn't sound too hard it's gonna be making sure that it fits what you expect out of the format so
um but no that's that's fine i'll d i'll have try to find i'll i'll have plen plenty of uh plenty of questions for you once i once i get to
the last stage i'm sure
yeah yeah
yeah we'll
yeah well the we're gonna get camtasia sorted out this week and then it's concentrate on the on the gest analyzer the g d f  stuff um and
then yeah once once we've done that it's whatever whatever you whate whatever you whatever you want me do once i done the once i've done the
g d f  i guess
yep yeah so i think the g d f  will keep me busy for a little while yet so um yeah well that's yeah certainly keep me busy until this time next week when we can start suggesting things that might might need to look at for the next stage i guess
yep okay

yeah
for the first yeah yeah
hmm actually yeah that reminds me i wo wo i wo i won't be uh on thursday i'm gonna be over in my induction day so so
fair enough fair enough i mean uh i don't it's meant to be that in depth it's
yes yes i mean i d i don't expect to be that in depth i mean it's fifteen minutes on a variety of different topics so it's just
it's uh it is uh yes it is i'm sure most of it i already know it's like fire safety yeah health safety data protection
usual sort of stuff you get everywhere so
yeah yeah
yeah
mm
yeah i mean i can remo

yeah i can remember when i start being a st when i was sta starting being a student i mean ha we had the inductions were compulsory because um
a lot of students were doing te were doing teaching and you couldn't do the teaching unless you done the induction because you had to know about health and safety and fire
safety before you could take a charge of yeah 'cause you were the responsible person in the in the class room so
so but uh yeah i'm not sure i'm not sure why the why why i'm doing it now but okay so see how it go i'll i'll uh give you my report on friday or something
yeah
huh
okay
so so that mean you need the blink corrections part of the analysis then um

right so tha tha that's uh that's for the rest of the stuff that comes the eye tracker isn't the analyzer software that comes the eye tracker

right
right okay well i i if if you want if you want the blinks mer merged into a fixation it might worth making making a cr part of the requirement for the
g d f  stuff so to remind me so to to just add that analysis to yeah to to it so it's i mean it's easy enough to do just
che just checking the times th times of the events
right okay okay
yeah yeah 'cause i think the ascii format as it stands does contain blink information um 'cause uh d d i'm sure i'm sure that's appeared in the in the documentation i've read through
possibly possibly yeah
right okay okay um yeah so might might worth us us having a look at that and just just seeing what
dat is what data is already in the ascii format and whether you want me to do any correction as part of the analysis um 'cause i've gotta do the analysis
for the fixations on parts and things anyway so yeah i d i i i didn't think check for blinks during that
isn't gonna be a shouldn't be a big problem
yeah yep um so we'll be
right mm hmm
and so are you looking for a final thing that just sort says between this time and this time you're looking at this object between this time this time you're not looking anything and
yeah yeah 'cause i think i think at the moment the g d f  format has fixations in it um so so i gue i guess that'd be part of the g d f  to transformation would be turning fixations into gazes and whatever else okay okay well tha tha don't don't uh worry about that just the moment but
right
right so so so w will you actually be doing much of the g d f  or is are you expecting do most the analysis on out of the n x t  stuff then so whe when you uh when you actually generate your results mm hmm
right
yeah uh yeah c well yeah you told that earlier 'cause you could do a quick ana you could do a quick analysis on the g d f  stuff without having to before you hit before you do the dialogue analysis type stuff so you can get some some results anyway can't you okay yeah
right okay okay
right
oh yeah yeah the germans don't yeah yeah yeah
fair enough fair en
yeah so so they they we're allowed to do whatever without without source code there's no c sort of restrictions on that fair enough fair enough
yeah i suppose i can easy look through and start writing up some documentation on it that'll gi that'll give us a starting point for us to sort to talk about it to look for
what analysis we n actually need to do on it and things um yeah easy c yeah create all the uh switches and whatever
else you need to do so um
okay okay yeah so we'll on once yeah well once i've had once i've had a bit of bit more look at this g d f  stuff then start looking through that start looking through that and make sure that works 'cause
yeah
yeah yeah i've l yeah i've no no noticed that the the the gest analyser knows quite a few things as well so um but as
yeah well uh i use it that useful for generating this g d f  stuff i can easily incorporate whatever functions it takes from into gest analyser when i'm do doing the g d f  stuff so
yeah yeah i mean but what yeah say what what i'll what i'll plan to do with it then is take the is take to the software find out what functions are useful for us in that and then use those functions to generate the stuff that goes into the x m l  file the the g f  format
yeah yeah so so the fir fir first part that'll be documenting what they've got and then discussing it with robin so uh yeah so so i suppose pose that that way the
right but yeah well i tr mo mostly yeah i'm sure i sure most the logic's gonna be gonna be the same so um
right yeah fair enough
yeah fair enough well so so it's so long as it's x m l  n x t  will handle it won't it 'cause
yep
fair enough
okay okay


yeah well i'm well i'm well g i've got the hang of all the stuff i've been going through and it looks like l looks like i'm coming to end of the stuff the stuff list there already so i'm gonna have start looking at that as the next stage so
yep


well i ma i ma i may be maybe i want to check out these batteries and things won't i so tomorrow well that'll be something to do well well will the will the will will do if the trains are tha as bad as today so
i mean if you're ever you know late 'cause of that it's not we'll find a way around it and i've put you guys on mondays at this time for my convenience but it's not like it's important that
really
i really great i was th so what'd they have to do back up

ah
nasty
yeah yeah go i we're glad they'll look after that bit
uh i don't know do we wanna look at anything it's not up yet

i can
oh i don't know what it's doing
oops that fell off
doesn't like silk
stay
and now we're gonna discover we've got no reason to meet right 'cause everything's going swimmingly
oh
'cause uh i haven't been i haven't read the wikis in my email since i left so um
oh yeah uh huh
uh huh
um the oh well um i don't know the mozilla stuff so if it turns out that it's idiosyncratic in some way that teaches you funny habits then it won't have been a good idea so
yeah yeah uh well y th there are certain companies um that i don't wanna name who don't always get it right i c but m yeah mozilla yeah it'll be alright so okay i believe you now it's a good strategy
mm hmm
uh wh why does it help that it's x t  h t m l  instead of just x m l 
yeah but most m most browsers when when you uh put an x m l  file up in it it'll just apply some default style sheet to it anyway that shows you
okay yeah
okay so all you're gonna have to do is swap in tag names later okay
ev everybody's got their different ways of doing these things i'm sure that's fine like having to uh g it's
yeah no i'm just try i'm trying to l think of the things that could go wrong um but since i haven't tried it this particular way
you know um but yeah that sounds good so um i so you say we haven't
finalised what the g d f  looks like is that an implicit request for me to do something or
uh huh
yeah as a well i mean there's two two cases in here right there's things you can get straight off the
original format and then there's things you have to do some kind of post processing of the original format but it's not just a data format change it's
actually some kind of computational process to get the thing out of it as well right and it wasn't uh y i think it was a little
bit um confused uh last time we spoke about um whether
u whether you consider g d f  format to be um the thing that's just the straight forward translations
of what's in the original eye tracking output or whether like whether the post processing utilities are a separate
step 'cause i think you and i had separate different views on this but i can't remember w who had which
view at this point so y are you working uh actively on this anal these analysis things or you just working on
the translation uh so the data format translation
oh okay so you haven't looked at what's in there and what isn't in there that you need to do some really intensive transform to do not yet oh okay
yeah
uh huh
okay so this sounds like it's under control and you're happy and you guys are telling each other what you guys need to know so
i don't need to do anything right you're all fine but there was a number of things that came before this right that
it sounds like they're not under control yet so so you know the g d f  stuff with so i ellen's view on this is we
go through everything in order like the priority is exactly the pipe line order right so um camtasia
you mentioned and i'm not sure what else but we should check what other things were before this on the list of things to do
until you get the oh microphones
batteries
okay uh are they really really strange batteries
have you tried maplin
are they expensive
'cause you know like a wee bus journey over to maplin might solve the problem if it's getting in the way
so this isn't actually um ruining your schedule for anything and that's why you're waiting
right okay it is i so it sounds like you're not actually worried about the fact that this is the m yeah
when you get worried go to maplin okay phone them first to make sure that they're in there somebody around must have a
uh probably steve somebody in the techie group will have a maplin catalogue fact i'll see if i can
um yeah it's useful to know who's got a current one anyway i don't seem to get them anymore
i guess i don't buy enough equipment

oh yeah of course duh
so you can find out whether they have it but you'd have to phone over to find out if they have it in stock down there i actually live not that far from there um so
it would be a half hour um diversion from my morning routine
to pick up stuff uh w but then again it's also very close to haymarket so
it's even less of a diversion for you probably except you don't know your way around
ah yeah oh yeah c yeah
yeah i just think well you know for the sake of three quid or however many quid it how many batteries does this thing take doesn't take a hundred
yeah then you know put your mind at rest
'cause you know you wouldn't want it to be the morning you were supposed to be recording and then suddenly discover yeah you know this
uh check they got 'em first though their stocks are a bit funny down there
'cause you know it's not that attractive an area to walk through if you're not gonna get anything out of it
so of all the things that were on the wiki do i need to pull up the wiki ah it is gonna let me log in

no i do not wanna change my password
um
but you guys probably know off the top of your head is there anything else that we we we were waiting on before you could run
so all those tasks craig had when it started
uh his last day was the thirty first of october
uh yeah no no it's ours yeah it's ours oh so he's got ours left he's behind hand but no he was billing for
he was billing by the hour so i thought well i mean obviously if he wants to finish off
then you know i b
oh well they're probably away then
wasn't ellen away they're really at the same place
oh yeah it could be it
oh you have no models at all oh that's a pity
model buil builder that's what i was calling the graphical model editor right so you use x  fig to make the parts and then you this thing
oh okay
yep
okay um i have something in my email about from joe uh he wouldn't have sent it just to me would he do you want me to check that i'm not gonna project my email

okay i think i mighta heard thursday or something i can't remember exactly when it was
uh

okay so i've got something on the twenty eighth that's friday i think oh he just wants to know how to get paid right that suggests he's done done done anyway he's in edinburgh so well i suppose he won't come by 'cause craig's on his desk
yeah so
well he's just not gonna try to le squat there that's all
uh well i so the last thing i've got from him about work work was the nineteenth of october that said he uploaded some changes that you wanted that's
oh so you didn't get that it was me and him but presumably the he put it on the wiki so
so he's just telling us 'cause he things we probably don't read wikis
and i'll just check
yeah well i i haven't replied to him about yeah i really don't have anything more more recent from him s i haven't replied to him about um
you know how to submit costs and stuff like that so um but that suggests he's at at the end of things but w
we could just ask him i mean maybe you guys would just wanna ask him directly you're done done right 'cause um it's
worth you guys knowing and then of course any problems that remain you inherit uh right
you know it's worth taking a look at what it does and making sure it does what you want i guess so th the problem is you want
you wanted to construct some models in it for your experiment but you were hoping to get some from marloes
ah yeah yeah
right have you you tried cold calling her that's what i do when i need things that
ach try phone
when i if you get 'em today when are you gonna start running
oh right so you have to be you have to be ready by then
yeah or re change the schedule
right okay
uh huh yeah makes sense
um subjects you're gonna have d
yeah so s y y you don't have subjects lined up but you don't expect any trouble getting them
mm hmm
yeah
by
um i don't know this person so they well
they need to be serious about it who who's their is that a staff member or a student okay um well
we kinda paid for the lab so it depends but i suppose talking to them
sometimes solves these problems um you might it depends on what sort of staff member is it
is it a
right um i mean presumably he or she is not running subjects the entire
block book for how long
uh huh
uh huh um so uh um ellen's still out of town right it's just uh
y you could try calling this person and see how this works ellen might be more persuasive
um it's just sometimes uh academic staff have a bit of a chip about
um research staff and since i don't know the person i can't tell whether it's one of those or not
mm hmm yeah and then escalate i guess but uh you know or whether they
can be put off for a little bit or something so i have no idea how the booking system works
well you're discussing it on thursday right at the moment there's just a booking system yeah
yep well that's that's one to raise at the meeting um i v might talk to ellen about that ahead of time 'cause uh they may have she and martin may have had discussions about appropriate use of the lab
oh really yeah but i g don't you guys set up for isn't block booking more appropriate because
i i isn't there set up involved in changing around for somebody else
no or in the software or anything okay
so there's no cost associated with it being mornings or afternoons
yeah s so in the worst case um you may be able to make an argument if you actually need that week that you can collect in the mornings that week is this something that's known outside ellen's head
it's on the w booking system
oh well that's something
uh huh well most the time to to p yeah so it sounds like you've got a lot of possible ways of getting what time you need of course try to be kind to other people but you would anyway so
so those are the only things that are worrying you camtasia and lab access and otherwise no sweat you're happy
oh and the model builders yeah
oh yeah h uh huh
these this is gonna take a little while
mm hmm
yeah but you were gonna try and figure out how to overlay something on top of the video that or no you were just g really gonna run a video of the sep of the trial yeah okay that's that's much easier
so um with the model builder what do you need to do with it th the um which one you is gonna look at what it does so far and you'll just t try out do that yeah
yeah
uh huh um how many models were you relying on her for so are you suddenly gonna be

well what i'm trying to get at is is your start time gonna be delayed 'cause you don't have the models ready if she doesn't come through
uh huh yeah well
um can you draft craig in to build some if necessary
yeah well you know me contingency planning and all this i always worry about the worst
you can um call a jast telcon between you and marloes you know i if
it's not that see you know with the cold calling you can usually at least find out whether they're alive and get an an offer to
to get something but you know the next the next escalation is saying no we really need to talk about this we're gonna talk about
it you know tuesday at such such a time unless you
um
but presumably whatever it is they've been going through is now over
mm hmm yeah i d
i'd just hate for that to c um to slow you up in collecting stuff that's all
obvious yeah uh okay that's true well that sounds
that's quite a small thing she can do for you i guess you know it's not like you know w sitting there brain deadly constructing you know some models that she needs to do it's just to provide advice about this which must take take less time
well that all sounds fine you guys worried about it you worried about anything we've mostly been talking about the experiment schedule so
mm

you're gonna run out of things to um f do that we haven't set you up for any time soon the g d f  sounds like it might take a wee while
yeah but you don't need anything from me for that 'cause that's already sorta speced i mean again that's the pair of you
yeah it's just what i'm worrying it w worried about is him being in the lab all day long and you not being sure like what to do for the analysis on or something 'cause you're gonna be completely unavailable when you're recording or will there be times when you don't record all day
uh huh
yeah 'cause he might oh yeah no no no i understand that it was it was more like
oh it was more like you know you so this week he's got you know the g d f  stuff to do then next
week you're planning on recording and what happens if suddenly you're unavailable all of next week just when he runs out of
work
yeah so so we'll worry about it then
mm hmm yeah
yeah
what i do don't know is we wanna bother with a part builder i mean the idea was it wasn't worth the investment right
yeah yeah yeah or do y
m yeah but now now that the guy building these models know that they need to do the rotsym some stuff do they have do you have trouble doing it no so
yeah well g i mean um we might want to um severely cash
limit the investment that you put into making a part builder right so how how many
person days would it be worth like if craig discovered it could be done in x  days
right so there's your limit don't spend more than a day or two on it yeah uh 'cause it really isn't worth it you you have to understand there's things about this project we've hidden from you so far that you'll have to learn about so it's it's not like you're out of work
oh really oh that one'll just be a little add on that'll whatever it is it'll be the same skills as you've learned for something else um
and it'll just be i'm not even sure that's you 'cause i think somebody else is doing that actually but um i'm thinking more of the fact that um
at some point we should probably tell you about this n x t  stuff so
oh yeah yeah yeah but you know there's x m l  and x m l  and you know it takes stand off links and stuff and
it's um some some people if they're not used to linguistic annotation c um uh it c take a little time to
get their head around the way the do data data model works and um you know there's stuff
to learn there so
yeah yeah yep
so
yeah so just don't witter away you know weeks on fripperies when we've got the real me meat of this yet to come we'll find we'll find plenty of really really crucial s things for you to do so
okay so uh i'll uh remind myself to look at what's next before the next time we get together
yeah so you collect on monday that means you don't wanna meet right
oh r right it's actually next week it's actually the week that you were planning on
oh okay
well i don't know anyway um you'll tell me whether it we cancel this or whether i just talk to craig in which case we won't be up here 'cause we don't record twos
oh yeah that should be fun
let's see that's like the
that comes at an ideal time for you then
that's like the twentieth or something
uh i can't add monday is the
yeah
oh yeah you have to promise to tell us how that is 'cause people do ask me
yeah on a scale of one to seven
yeah
yeah you'd be surpri these things do
well if they were gonna do that then they'd force you to go to it i would and i would know somebody who'd gone to know you know i'm pretty sure they didn't have induction in my day so
really but you only started here
they were supposed to i'm sure

oh well
oh yeah uh
yep

mm hmm
okay
yeah
seems reasonable
so um it'll be like in uh monitor but yeah they'll all be different tiers like that and then there's the language stuff as well presumably
yeah this is the easy stuff yeah well eyes and mouse eyes and mice
uh huh
and that's enough for you right i mean that's just the way you want it course there are lot lots of things that can do that but it's the language part that's the hard part yeah
yeah that's
that seems fine yeah do you know what the um the sets of codes are well the whatev whatever whatever you're getting out of the jast analyser so
i mean blinks as well right
oh so you don't want a pa uh part of this data
aye but
i think you i think you should well there's two views on this um if you do then the people
formulating research questions will ask about them but if you don't they'll probably ask about them anyway and then you'll have to add 'em after
the fact uh so it's probably easier just to s shove 'em in you can stick 'em in a different um track and
uh and then load 'em or not load 'em as you please 'cause it's not well i don't know with is it
is it part of so th these are mutually exclusive and exhaustive sets of codes against time right
isn't blink a part of this
yeah but but isn't that important because when they're blinking basically it's like an a nil code you c can't
find out what they're doing otherwise so it may actually be important to have the blinks registered in there because you may discover you need
to take them into account to smooth some kind of analysis that you're doing so it could be that if they only they hadn't
had a blink just then they would've been i don't know what
i'm thinking more
that you wanna know about oh i hope n not to much relies on missing
stuff 'cause people blink i was thinking more like um you know the person looks a p a part
and they've got a uh fixation before and after and there's blink in the middle and you know there may be times
when you wanna treat that as one thing right
oh right okay so but in that case
right uh huh in that case then um these tiers are already like blink corrected and then you wouldn't have blinks as part of this you'd want blinks as a separate tier if you're gonna have it in
yeah yeah so the key thing is he here is mutually exclusive and exhaustive and
um the second key thing is um it better be really clear to the people who are dealing with these codes
um uh w yeah whether any monkey business has been done around the blinks to correct for that
um 'cause you know it wouldn't necessarily be obvious looking at that set of codes that
uh yeah i suppose if you know about eye trackers then you'll just know but
it i think you're just saying it comes out of the eye tracker already right they're already blink corrected
yeah
yeah but what we need to know is like at what stage in the eye tracking stuff where it does that and whether that
gets through so that um craig gets it automatically in what he's translating or to g d f  whether he needs
to redo the same analysis because something about the data path cuts off that analysis for the eye tracker
or whether we even like it right and wanna do it some different way
yeah but it could be these things are corrected for blinks in this way plus there's blink information
so you know it it treats it as a fixation around blinks and it also just happens to tell you where the blinks are 'cause as they were saying
they like to use blink rate as measures of cognitive difficulty or something so
if they're not still fixating on it when they come back out of the blink then
why is that is that the right thing to do analytically
oh right yeah you said that
well but does um the duration of fixations count for anything 'cause it if you're just adding the length of the blink to the fixation you're not treating it as a saccade
okay
wait
okay i kinda get this yeah yeah mm hmm
so more complicated than i thought i'd forgotten about the multiple fixations on an object yeah okay
well it's not okay i mean this is kinda what we were talking about before this confusion about what's in the g d f 
i mean you might see it as the initial g d f  is just whatever straight forwardly translates without
you know without transforms with just the data format changing from the ascii and then there's a bunch of
other things that get added that you might still want to be in um augmented g d f  format
you know like this blink and the gaze and whatever else and then you translate to n x t  so you might still wanna
have everything in this one g d f  file format that represents everything and then the n x t  thing is just a splitter it's not doing
any fancy analysis so i see this as you know a bunch of little routines that take the the g d f 
without this information in it and add new information into th sub script versions of the g d f  file that contains
these post process analyses
yeah
yeah
yeah i mean it to some extent it doesn't matter which data format it's in n x t  or g d f  but it makes more sense for
the converter between g d f  and n x t  not to add any data all it does is do this this stupid
data format conversion and it it's just you know separating it out in the little steps so you know there have
to be these other scripts that add any um data transforms um not data format
transform forms but data transforms like this idea of um of putting together gazes from fixations
so y you know i if we keep it simpler like that so that it's in little pieces then it'll be just easier to
understand w what the wh the whole thing does
'cause you you c you know i if suddenly you discover there's a problem with the g d f  to n x t  transform you wanna know whether it's one of these little post processes
going wrong or whether it's just the thing that dumps it into the multiple files for the and g d f  to n x t  transform
is c is pretty simple so um you know
oh yeah
so that's like all the analysis that you need to do to things are you just gonna copy what they do or is it documented like why they did it they way they did it or is it just
well it's good starting point right so it'd be interesting to see if you agree with the decisions that they made about how to do things
mm
ah
well b but we don't wanna build it into our data path we just wanna learn from it i think right correct or no
yeah i'm just thinking you know like i so this takes the ascii to to a d simplified ascii
and simplified in with transforms in it ascii and it's just it seems to be harder to
maintain something that's got that in it if it'd be better to break things up into like steps
that you know as part of the the and als well why do i think this i don't know because
it's somebody else's programme and then they're gonna give us the next version and that's gonna break our entire pipeline you know
that's the main reason
yeah uh yeah i can imagine i can imagine that also requiring some discussion about whether what they do is what we actually wanna do that should be interesting uh
uh huh
well sounds good
yeah
and if in doubt um don't filter stuff out keep it in right 'cause we always dump it to this other n x t  track that we don't need to load necessarily so um the idea is you just keep stuff unless
mm hmm
oh yeah and it's easy enough to dump stuff into an into separate track w we gotta teach you about this at some point though so
um but still not quite sure when it sounds like maybe in another week so jonathan
made me promise not to um tell you about it when you first arrived 'cause you were gonna get overload about learning eye trackers and
no it's just too many things at once and it wasn't important that it be then
yeah so
yeah he's a cool customer he's ready for it okay i think we're done right
sorry oh yeah i don't know i do not really need to this just says look at the wiki find out what's next you could give give craig more work to do this one's mine it
oh yeah well that'll take forever
that's that's really fun check your batteries

yeah it says

is it sliding past


yes
still fifty six percent completed skip it 'cause i'm just doing a b yeah disk check or something
yep
is everything going smooth


hmm
mm as long as it comes out in the end that's
mm

uh nope don't think so um
mm hmm
uh it's batteries we're waiting for the they're they're due uh i i was told the beginning of this week
um th they are quite strange mm uh uh it's w uh r um a avril has ordered them from somewhere possibly n no they're probably one fifty each or something like that
uh well hopefully the they should've been here last week but uh caroline then phoned up to chase them and they they were s they were told to be here should be today
uh r b well we can still test whether camtasia runs anyway it's just the uh whether it's the microphones are picking up things correctly that we need to check
not yet no right
mm right o

virtual
yep
uh right but what we're
i i
mm hmm it no it's two batteries we need

uh no no no yes
fair fair enough if you want mm hmm

it's still probably even that angle

can't remember the wiki d um

the only thing that well the thing that's holding s me slightly up is um
checking whether joe's f finished that there i there is a working um model builder but
i'm not sure if it's the finished finished version yet and the the ninth
yeah he still had n hours left i wasn't sure uh if it was down to the number of hours or whether thirty first of october f uh certainly uh uh he right
i think he's had something like seven
but uh n i've n ni nijmegen has gone dead for all those last two weeks
well uh it w e e ellen's away n no um but i think what they had was some big review
uh a and so i haven't heard anything back from them so uh the models for
yes uh huh well no well we don't need to um make the the parts are all the standard
tangram ones i had before anyway the x  fig thing's only when we come to building airplanes and new peculiar shapes
uh but for this experiment it's just the tangram type uh task
um yeah if you got right
how r f how recently that nothing i haven't i heard anything from joe for a a week or so anyway so
yeah that's that's newer than the
it's the last thing was in sp response to the thing i was saying last week about the parallelogram
being the wrong way around and uh w from the model builder to the actual yeah
um that nothing has i haven't heard anything since from either sort of the netherlands
or from you
yep
oh is he back oh is he oh no right okay



yeah it was after it was after that that uh there was the thing about um w w why the parallelogram was the was a mirror image

mm hmm

yes
yes or at l least um she was meant to have have some idea of the level of complexity 'cause they d they d have actually run things and to uh get an idea of the sort of style and to check that they'd be alright but all very quiet
yeah
uh no it has just been email rather than uh f f the telephone type of uh request but

i'm down for a week what's the seventh is a w a week today i think next week
um well uh i haven't booked anybody in or anything but uh that's when i'm hoping we have been of course put back a bit by the eye tracker going down
but uh we're we're needing we're certainly needing some data in the bag by the first of december i think
no
um hopefully not
the only other slight complication is um which will be b i think brought up at the meeting on thursday
for all the eye tracking users um uh the lab has
been block booked again
jules from um psychology
have di
yep
lecturer
well presumably not but uh it's sort of quite solidly booked uh for f certainly w what six days from ten till five for two or three of those days

um i wouldn't i no i can probably at least email her and ask her uh if she's really needing it all that time
i i well yeah at the m yep when people just uh if they can log on to it can book it
mm hmm
uh i th in theory jast is meant to have it every morning


um but it uh there shouldn't be any changes in the physical connections or or anything no
uh no that as long as p other people don't for some reason i don't know disconnect some bits of the equipment there's no reason why they should it's just the
uh yes it's um it's on the p uh it's not on the booking system it's on a
web page that frank created about the lab which i don't know if anybody actually knows
is there mm hmm
yep

should should be i've also got to get camtasia we well yes the m the model builder i've got to get camtasia working um as a sort of little multi media thing to generate a video of how to mi sort of a an instructional video
it's what i'll have to do this week
hmm
u
yep yeah
uh i'll i'll do that yeah and just yeah mm hmm
mm
have a look at uh um hopef hopefully there's not a p a problem but uh they said marloes was uh also meant to be checking it and doing things and quiet
um i've i uh it hasn't been divided up in that sort of way but
um depends how quickly i manage to get a grip of it how long it takes me to generate them or how i get on with the camtasia

mm hmm un unsure of yet
it it shouldn't the there shouldn't be any great uh problems just checking that the they're of a suitable
level of complexity or or of whatever
yeah yeah no quite quite right yeah so yeah
um yeah well i was hoping for some feedback from yeah yeah exactly
yes
yep mm book a time and i think so right well i'll try and get ahold of her again today and see what
i think it it was up till the end of october so presumably today they're now free again or taking a week off to recover yes
um well hopefully it it won't anyway it's just if i then do it i hopefully
will get the right models that's that's the pro so uh uh it will be generated it's whether the models are optimal
or not that i think that's right
mm hmm
yep
mm hmm
mm hmm well so it was the whole all the dynamic region part of it that's uh
mm hmm
uh n um no uh well it depends how how many i can book in and
get get running yeah and before my brain melts it but w when when the experiment's running yeah it's
i'll be in the lab uh i can't just go in let them get start and then come back it's uh so
some people can but
uh th they'll certainly be time because i'm right next to the lab anyway i'll come back just to check my email and things anyway so uh yeah

mm hmm
mm hmm

no

mm hmm
mm hmm
uh i wouldn't bother more than one or two certainly


mm hmm w
mm hmm
i don't think you'll be twiddling your thumbs no
um well at twelve o'clock next monday the lab is technically booked by jules
it
uh it starts the uh on we this wednesday and goes through to next wednesday
mm hmm
um what else uh yeah my then other complication is two weeks tomorrow i start my teaching
mm hmm for i've got two weeks of that fo four lectures and four labs

yes
uh what's tomorrow is the f tomorrow the f first so it will be the fifteenth for two weeks
oh you've got your uh induction that's right

uh yes from a total waste of time to you know
mm hmm it's probably the university'll cover itself legally i think by doing this uh mm hmm

uh no i suppose rather than being nobody's bothered so far is it uh well i don't remember being asked for an induction so
in april
i got invited to a um a a a summer garden party for new staff members but that was but that's all

hmm

uh uh
i have one n x t  question which hopefully won't be well it's not one just hopefully as part of the output
it will be something like that is that correct so you've got the gaze position
of the first person gaze position of the second mouse position of the first mouse position of the second and i don't know
a common mouse action there or something does that t just in in sort of layers like that
yeah
yep
yes uh huh m that's that's just the the eye movement uh other sort of stuff yeah
it ho hopefu uh hopefully that's yeah i guess it's that's why i dre
as well yeah mm hmm yeah so i was just yeah i was just checking that uh i know the language part because they say l p  here but uh this would be the the the new part new stuff
uh yeah whatever that is
um yes i'm not sure whether we need to know exactly where they are just how many there are in each tra um uh p i don't know i suppose it could go in uh i mean i suppose it we're as well to have it if we can
right
well uh just say stick 'em in anyway yeah mm hmm
mm hmm um blink would uh uh at the moment just get lumped in with the sort of previous gaze
mm hmm
the way they're looking mm hmm
mm hmm
m uh yes mm hmm moving somewhere else or is more likely to be uh
blinking at the same time as the other person was doing something i think to mm hmm yeah

yes norman normally uh would be just as i say like add the blink time and duration to the previous fixation
'cause you're not absorbing any new information and that's what the critical sort of deciding factor is
yes so that they'll include the
so i i yeah would ha it would be as a separate tier where just to mark
the actual position
mm hmm
what's included and what's n yeah mm hmm
hmm no not certainly l not looking at codes no
mm hmm know what to look for and what not to yeah
uh i there are well they're already identified as blinks then it's uh
i it is at th hmm at what stage the software that i've used uh p
pools uh the blinks so will add it on i'm not sure what the default
yes yeah so i'm not su i certainly it's listed as a separate event in the stream blinks are a tag uh from the e d f  and and that sort of thing it's registered as a a detection but
mm mm hmm
uh i y yeah uh i mean it it it won't because of the fixation it will be down to what we define as uh
a gaze so basically the time from when somebody starts looking at an object until
they leave it and so if they blinked a lot within that they're still looking at that object so it's just the time in
to the time out
mm hmm
yep
mm hmm
hmm some other way
yes
mm hmm yep there's a blink sort of event
mm hmm

yep
it should just be a matter of treating a b adding on the blink to the last fixation or something anyway
uh well uh the the real reason is um as long as they've been blinking even if they then open their eyes somewhere else that's when they start absorbing the new information
it's basically like a just a long saccade mm it you kind of have visual suppression when you move and it's the same when you're blinking you're not taking anything in so
uh it it's yeah that yes um that's for the sort of gaze time measure uh it's not actually
the fixations are still um independent so the they w fixation duration isn't doesn't include
the blink in the ascii a output it's only when we start looking at sort of the total gaze that um
the total amount of time spent looking at one particular object which includes all these sort of multiple fixations and
any blinks and that sort of thing is it it's a a sort of composite uh viewing time
uh yeah i'm afraid uh mm hmm
yep yep
although we'll also still need a count of the fixations just so we can have you you've got measure fixation
duration again just to s see if those they spend longer just f amount of more stable move
uh eye fixation or not uh
mm hmm
yep to ye yeah mm hmm viewing times
mm hmm
right yeah
mm hmm well that's partly why i brought this up now is it i'm not sure what point down the data path things sort of happen but that's what i want out in the end
um well the n x t  stuff will have the more complete picture 'cause it will include
combine all the linguistic stuff with all the movements and the actions um
but there'll be i suppose just some purely eye movement stuff we could do i s presumably
with g d f  uh
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
hmm
hmm c
an
and uh yeah that's also why i sent you the mm saarbruecken software f that uh
the stuff that takes the ascii sort of format originally and then just uh sort of compresses it and things
yeah the german stuff uh because that little utility um does things like t
well but you can tell it to what to do with blinks whether just to lump them in or or not uh what the minimum
fixation duration for a stable fixation would be sort of you have if it picks up t fixations
less than say fifty milliseconds you can tell it just to again lump them all together that's not a sort of reliable
enough fixation uh you can put in these sort of of things so that's uh that's a bit of software
that's sent and that includes the source code and things as well
mm hmm
uh no there's very little documentation as you might imagine for these sort of things yeah so i g i uh yeah that's that's why so mm hmm
mm hmm hmm
mm hmm
fine good
mm hmm 'cause uh al also just filters it there are a lot of um strange
event tags that the eye link produces that are fairly meaningless i think
and it can stri it strips out a lot of the junk uh as well so it cleans it up mm hmm
uh huh
right
uh b fine well um possibly
yep mm hmm
yeah
the pr
uh yeah uh huh yeah i see what you mean uh huh
mm hmm
six or
mm hmm it's it's not quite s it so it's not gonna be quite grabbable 'cause it is it's written in java

yeah well yes uh huh the actual uh
mm hmm
yeah it's always better than making too much compression to start with and then being out of unable to go back or yeah lossiness
or or you leave very quickly uh huh

yep well i'm i am
oh dear uh my page is blank still


i guess not
so welcome the first kick off meeting what shall we do first
the opening then the rest what are we going to do we m
have to make a new remote control it has to be original trendy and user friendly
so we will get back th on that first we have to make a functional
design after that we have to make a conceptual design and then after that a detailed
design so we'll discuss that later
first we have a look at so first to we have to make a small
painting what have do we have to do first
you can save the documents we have to do that every time we make something you can print
it no and we have to use the pen and the
eraser
so now we all have to use this one you have to make your own
favourite animal so i'll make an example
first don't touch that things
you can use the pen and then you can make um
something

um you can change some things um format
line and
change it

and you can change the
colour
so that's it
so
so and after it you have to save it now we can make a new one you have to paint now so you're next
what is going on
what are you what

um
is a it is a it is a
a duck

yes
hmm
blank yes
okay next one
oh




very good


okay very good so um you can always go back so

that's it so that was two now next the budget
the b uh we will sell the t at twenty five euros
and we have only twenty of twelve and a half euro to make it
so now we have to think about what we will make
first i wanna hear from you uh what are your experiences with
remote controls so
f first
is this positive or negative that uh big buttons
positive
okay what are your experiences
mm
so and do they always have that
it's easy to you okay
'kay
okay so they have too much so next for our own remote control we have to think
how do we make it so what ideas do you have for
it for the new remote control what what does it have to have
not too heavy
yes
yeah
yes
like a phone
okay
so that's
okay
yes
okay this is it has to be compatible with other things okay
yes
no battery use
so more ideas
no okay it's only the first ideas so uh what are we going to do now is next meeting is in half an h hour uh

okay next meeting half an hour um what you have to do
well look on your and
next instructions you'll get in your email so
this is the first meeting see you later in half an hour



hmm
that's uh strange
yeah
okay let's try this uh
um mm hmm
mm


uh
no no yeah okay
uh blank

no
uh well i think the the the goal of a remote control is that it's it it has an influence on the t v  set and that it controls the channels and the the volume
and uh i i i think it's positive if there's a a led uh
uh a led on the corner of the of the remote so that you know it s it still has batteries on it
in it and that if you push the button the led uh gives a light and uh and you see that it's
working
and uh yeah uh
yeah but
no no no but i my my experience is that it it it's convenient to have that yeah yeah
hmm

yeah
yeah well that's that are good ideas uh
yeah well the led on the corner that that indicates that it's working if you push a button um
yeah
and looking on the budget not too expensive uh material so probably plastic or something uh
mm no
yes



nice

an elephant
'kay
pop ups

what is this pictionary

uh a bird
bird

yeah
whoo
oh not oh
okay okay yeah no problem
shit happens
a parrot ish
he did it before



oh
thank you
uh i will start uh big one they are uh not easy to use
um i have one set and uh a remote control when i dropped it uh it broke so that
won't be uh our goal i think and uh g big buttons
m uh that's easier to use than uh i think
not all the small buttons you don't know
big buttons positive all all small buttons like when you have uh like a hundred buttons on your remote control you won't know what they're working for
thank you
help also thank you
the weight not not too heavy
not much buttons
bust free that when you drop it it won't break like uh some kind of rubber on it or hard uh hard plastic
uh buttons not too small
uh something like when you uh lose your uh remote control sometimes it happen uh it between
the couch and you can't find it when you push a but a button on the t v  then you hear some uh some sort of
bleep and then you uh hey there there's remote control


next

i have one more idea just popped up
uh it it won't take a lot of batteries so you don't won't have to change the batteries uh once a week or uh once every two weeks
okay thank you

yep





okay
oh
well we will try
where it going
hmm



uh

mm
so
now save
now uh blank
yeah

yeah yeah


i'm not getting anything uh on my screen now
okay
wow
oh



nice



uh at home we have a t v  a video uh recorder a d v d  player and a satellite receiver
we have uh four distinctive remote controls for that that's not really ea easy
so it would be nice if we have one for all
and we also had a remote control for our radio set but um
i it it had a lot of buttons on it and you didn't know which one was what and it was uh uh v
not easy to use so we n barely used it
yeah
yeah i think it uh from a marketing point of view it also has to look nice or you won't sell it
and um yeah uh on our website we can see what products we already have and it should work with as many uh as possible of them
yes
okay

okay
hmm so we all attended interspeech no
so how many sessions you attended i mean did you attend any any session
yeah that's really that's really your
so any general impression or feedback so f for any of you
it's a first conference or maybe for no i mean in the sense that it's uh interspeech
is really big conference for speech so did you attend before
uh ok ok yeah o ok yeah so then you're hiding a you have attended before yes yeah i see see yeah yeah
i t i
uh i think it's quite interesting but only annoying thing is this multiple sessions
and most sometimes you can't able to go to oral talk this oral presentations most of the time
because because like posters is you can spend a lot of time posters looking
at m many posters than sitting twenty minutes for one oral presentation so in t twenty minutes you can see
at least two three posters and you can directly talk to people so even i found
like uh very few people in some oral presentations i think most of the people are
like their own posters only
yeah how presentations are hardly handful of like f five or more yeah
ah ok
hmm yeah
ah okay
yeah even some panel discussions on that human speech recognition reducing gap between the a s r  and and h s r  it was a bit interesting lot of arguments and
yeah b differently it's mainly the differences different approaches of engineers versus linguists or phoneticians and yeah mm
ah okay
yeah even the panel discussions w i think one is really held in small room so people were really crowded
yeah it's
yeah

yeah
ah ok we went to like far south to lagos and yeah that wa uh ha yeah that was really good those beaches are really good
yeah even dolphin in the yeah but the weather was really hot
the south it's more than thirty five uh lisbon was good
um little bit bit mm
yeah even local transport it's it's but yeah most of the time the buses are really crowded uh
yeah yeah
yeah because it's really big city no no like
mm yeah
hmm
yeah yeah no re yeah but that's that's not good direct bus is not good
like so you can go to the direct uh ce central place and then
occas uh mm
yeah da
uh what is the place uh the the central i mean where we
change the bus to yeah in the yeah maybe you
can check the booklet yeah it's
there like i used to find bus numbers from book only
oh okay
oh okay
it's like uh in
it's like uh all the semi tied covariance matrices or yeah so did they reduce it's in between the direct covariance this is full covariance should try to reduce some parameters by tying
oh

uh
ah okay
yeah mm
in your tie in
no i think they got good results with just using diagonals or definitely yeah yeah
mm maybe decorrelation again they do d c t  or k l t  or they do that l d a  or like
yeah so
no but still there is there is still ev that's why like people come
yeah definitely it's not optimum so it's it's also like doing along along the diagonals all again
it's really computationally really uh yeah so see suppose if thirty nine in te thirty nine to thirty nine for every yeah yeah so
uh there is a thing
yeah ne no problem but if you see so many models and so many mixtures yeah but
yeah thirty you can see you c you can't really like even you can't the models itself is like thirty
eight times more than that so so y if you have like five megabytes or ten megabytes of models then
yeah but even i think it's really bit like impossible for the really big systems
i guess like storing storing itself
yeah yeah yeah yeah it's really ti
yeah yeah for every you're so you're to store all this thirty
yeah
so from
mm hmm mm hmm
speak uh yeah different task and
so uh i found one paper interesting i think you know vivek most of you know uh this is uh vivek's paper
on like variable scale feature extraction normally we use to fix it
window for feature extraction like twenty five milliseconds or thirty seconds here he's proposing variable
scale because the fixed scale is non optimal for it's
non optimum because like for vowels you can have m much longer and for plosives and
these things you really shorter like even around less than twenty milliseconds also so
he's ki proposing like this variable scale window f uh kind of
online for each segment
yeah mm mm you can do like you can measure and you can do but he's mm basically doing some mm likelihood
ratio testing so if so the main idea is like suppose you have uh one segment
so he's trying to find the stationality cautious stationality of that segment
yeah as much as possible like but yeah definitely you have to assume some l uh like minimum and maximum
sizes of your own so he is using minimum of minimum is uh i think twe i don't twelve point five milliseconds
i think maximum is uh sixty milliseconds
so the minimum
no no i think a minimum is twen twenty milliseconds is i yeah twelve point five milliseconds is kind of sift twenty millis minimum is no no de because of uh
no you can use mol yeah no mainly because of uh m f c c  computation because yeah
it becomes really noisy like if you s yeah ten milliseconds means you have only eighty samples for
uh and then you have refused twenty four filters the filters won't get any samples so
yeah because of computation so even i i think even st uh he can find less than twenty millisecond windows also especially for plosives uh
shifting yeah he's using twelve point five millise yeah shifting is almost same but the problem like
he
yeah yeah he's keeping same number of frames uh he's using uh twelve point five yeah twelve point five millisecond
yeah
number of uh frames w you want to
actually the problem's again uh uh you see the shift is the nyquist frequency if you compared modulation
spectrum so again if you change this shift the mod the nyquist the modulation spectrum nyquist
frequency changes for each window so if you want to do again another high level feature extraction again
it will be problem so so but he's uh like he's he discuss i mean describing
this because even this itself is a problem keeping the f uh fix to frame size
because you're analysing your this uh segment many times
so this shift will suppose if you find one segment of sixty milliseconds and then you're doing this
ten millisecond so every almost i think yeah mm uh yeah five frames y you're analysing
the previ this already segment so so again this may blur some frequency transitions
or yeah but the problem is again this uh bottleneck is here like you can't
change your nyquist frequency modulation and
yeah
yeah yeah
so it's so uh so the main idea is like first to take the some some window some sam some samples then he assume somewhere some variable and point there is a change
then then it's not symmetric i you can cho uh y it's basically uh too like again
do for all the samples in that gyro so then what he does is like he proposed uh
like some like ratio test based on maximum likelihood so th tha that is really simple like so
what he does is like so he he computes the residual he first he does the l p 
analysis and then he computes the residual and he takes the residual energy of f full
signal like gy gy gyro samples
the full signal so maybe i can
the wh the whole window
no that's that like he assumes yeah sixty milliseconds or something he start with so
so then he can yeah yeah yeah then he can split that window at
point n  say point n  so then you will have gyro two no you can
segment it maybe
yeah so yes he's supposed this is your p window so then
you can move your like this you can move your point so that then this will be like
one and this will be second but again he assumes some initial
uh sizes for these windows
yeah he don't start with the yeah he don't s yeah start with gyro sample or something he's
starting with uh so the l left window is starts at twenty milliseconds so so you already
hear like s suppose this is full signal you're already here so right window is should end
at twelve point two so you're to search basically in this range so
yeah
yeah
yeah and then if you the maximum is sixty millisecond frame for him so if you don't find anything
sixty milliseconds if you d
no the point is depending on the likelihood ratio so he got so he supposed this so
this is suppose se segment one and this is segment two so he compute this error
here so and then he p gives some kind of in terms of this
residual letter so this residual letter is for full gyro samples
then there would be suppose this point is say n  so gyro to n  and then like
so this the b basically the main he questions or here
yeah he's for finding the likelihood for full frame and then it's basically likelihood ratio test so he's comparing the likelihood of the full segment divided by the likelihood of the the sub segments
likelihood of the uh like this likelihood is uh this error estimate of the residual
so residual power he can compare t so he after do after doing l p  he can get a l residual and then he can compare the power
of the residual so that he's proving that power is again maximum likelihood estimate
of your l p  parameters so that which interesting it's you don't really need to do
a lot of computation you just need to take the error of n uh residual of this full window and then
residual of energy of the sub windows and then you can just divide them and then the only
thing is like again he has to use some threshold to decide that that's only the p problem
he got uh he's founding something more uh around three or three point five e s t  optimum threshold
but the and another advantage is like it's not really changing speech recognition whatever
so not really changing because of the threshold so uh you don't really need to f
like fiddle with threshold a lot so mm
yeah
yeah yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah this is yeah i understand this is this is the actually basically some theoretical proof
like maybe if you want threshold you can see and he's coding from
uh leven like uh no this is from again yeah statistical signal processing what they say here is
like suppose if you analyse two distinct or uh this l p 
analysis in the same stationary analysis window the coding will always be greater than the ones
resulting from this analysis in two windows two stationary
windows
so the he's basically based on this theorem so so what he's saying is like if you do this error it will be always greater than the mm th these errors of two stationary windows
yeah
yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah this maybe i think yeah this he's getting some improvement but
yeah yeah yeah yeah so he's just uh uh he's normalising the energy coefficient because energy is really affected a lot uh so he's li
energy like because c  gyro component like so he's using m f c c  so he's normalising the c  gyro component for this t yeah
power is again like yeah yeah yeah yeah it's time like yeah it's okay like samples or you can see root mean square energy or something
yeah
yeah
no no n no you vo what you mean like the window lent the sixty mil no it i it doesn't really
uh but i think it's he he doesn't use i guess because uh uh then like you just you take these features and you train model so it really matters wh what frame shift you're using for models like because how many he needs to use same freq
no no wait no he will get like every ten milliseconds he get one fra one features like he it
doesn't really depend because suppose if you take your t case like you your window i maybe longer so doesn't really
matter like how what size window you use or not but i tell uh at every ten milliseconds whether you give
some features or not really matters no like so so it doe you can use uh thirty milliseconds
or fifty millisecond window
same yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah framing it's like it's really yeah yeah
if you have if you're change framing it's really i think even it's really problem no
like if you try even models also i guess if you change it's not only with this model it's in spectra and shifts
in deltas because
yeah but it's really complicated i think if you use yeah that becomes really
yeah but this is kind of interesting
yeah yeah yeah the temporal dec
mm hmm
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah yeah first this is proposed by like uh even we read one paper in our reading
group you remember that i have implemented it's quite working well like uh yeah mm
yeah yeah honza is also worked for his be yeah uh i yeah
ne he was re he was quoting
but that
yeah he was uh quoting that paper also like v he was telling this uh
this is kind of optimisation criteria what this temporal decomposition is doing like you're trying to
segment your s signal into like discreet windows and then so but he was
telling like this uh relationship between optimation and and then cautious stationality
is not really obvious so stationality is again different no stationality is this is
optimation we want to like see some signal few segments which can really represent whole
so maybe that's why like this may not be really
yeah yeah this one yeah he's getting some improvement n uh this is a yeah

no no no they again
but again uh getting that ten papers is really difficult task it takes maybe years and again
uh it definitely like who will who will choose the ten papers like and
if we asked yeah but yeah those things are practically kind of really but i think this kind of things what you showed
i mean what you said is really good like if people start implementing like some people propose
something in feature level some propose in something in model level but these two are really independent no
when really work combine these two or
yeah especially features like suppose if somebody come with different good features again people st again use m f c c s
no no it it's not really sure also make suppose uh people you can't really force people
to use same features so so they wo they will be happy with their own features and their own scripts so
their bit rate like tend to change features every time and it's
hmm
but even nist you can
yeah
yeah yeah
then
so at lea especially l v c s r  in really big systems then people
yeah yeah because yeah it's it's again you don't know
oh no then uh there will be only one conference in three years or something for speech because
but again like
that's so you can publish only once in three years or
yeah but even people are doing suppose in interspeech there was uh some challenge for speech synthesis
so so what's is uh like it challenge was really good like sup they give the database so you have to
work on that database what technique t use is it's your choice like but that database
and then the results analysis is they decide so even speech recognition also some
tests are coming like for phone segmentation or something people give some database and then you have to dis you
can use whatever you want and you have to produce even for features also like
features also i think
yeah yeah the they they designed the data such a way that it's it's really like really real uh data
no no for s nay speech synthesis it's like they give you some data so whether like you use
for training or l you can you can do like data driven or like model based approach or whatever like
at the end then they will ask you to synthesise some sentence and you have to synthesise them and then you have to send them
your training data onl no development training no yeah training
evaluate it's again subject to s uh because for speech synthes yeah yeah
listen and yeah d yeah even uh they it's mostly they use native speakers only because
they can really judge well so
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so even they propose some kind of word error rate so you have the original
speech so i the synthesised speech is there any words which are not matching so even speech synthesis
they're also uh introduced this w e r  term so uh but this was really quite
successful like in this conference interspeech so a lot of people participated in
uh i think even they're continuing this for uh next year and
text to speech but uh i heard like even for i cassp next year there is some com uh like computation
by martin krug sheffield and on this feature extraction stuff and so
at least if you make task simple focus then it may be good to compare these features and
but if you s use some uh large vocabulary system it takes t six months to build and at the end
you don't know whether your features are really uh so so maybe that's for like people
are always using p l p s or m f c c s it's it's such a b like lot of time involved so you can't
really check many thi
yeah yeah yeah yeah but at least in idiap we have this numbers recogniser is almost kind of free so everybody is using
so that's what we are doing no almost almost like we are putting different features and i think yeah yeah numbers
recogniser is not really different from like uh a f at least in idiap we have
almost same but maybe you are using twenty nine that's for you it's different but one more
but at least i twenty seven hemant and we're all using twenty seven so yeah
yeah
no but the problem is you're using only digits so maybe that's how you
no but test set is digits your m main task is digits k yeah that's uh like but o g i  numbers
are there like now we're little bit convulsed like we're using twenty seven phones and before it
was like twenty four twenty five but it's better like once you have like whatever the back end
then you can put features like whether they're gammas or like spectral entropies or m f c c s or whatever
then at least you can see
uh yeah yeah yeah but aurora is
aurora task so but aurora is it really big database or i mean how much time it takes to set up system and then
it's fast no but the problem is aurora again these models are word based models no
yeah so again here we use triphones and so but definitely i d
if we want to show noise setting it's you have to show on aurora also like aurora is real time
yeah
yeah
yeah yeah yeah but yeah
yeah at least i mean wha those studies i think people already did for even in i c  i c s l p  two thousand two
there is special session on features for aurora so yeah yeah i
yeah yeah this icsi features and this uh s uh s uh o g i  features
and all this so there are already people but again like uh at the end like for l v c s r 
people are using p l p s or m f c c s or nothing of these fancy feature

yeah
new
but maybe my have a f for publishing another paper or something
mm
yeah
but maybe guillaume you can tell no like uh you worked i with these siemens people or no siemens or these daimler chrystler what kind of features do you use like do you use um any you don't yeah you don't
ah ok okay okay
ah ok
yeah even s yeah i didn't discuss anything with sunil also like i dunno technical discussions
anything these kind of things are a bit yeah yeah yeah but do you have any like feeling
that whether they go for all these new features or they usually use only mm
maybe yeah
mm hmm
hmm
but even they don't believe like with one paper or two i guess because at least for them no p l p s or m f c c s they know that okay these things work on every task so okay we can pu put hands on these things yeah
huh
yeah yeah yeah yeah maybe like yeah f because sunil is working in nokia he's a expert in
kind of features or yeah it l i think but yeah we're not sure
even sunil won't tell us
no no n no this uh cohen you mean like uh uh
hmm
oh ok
huh
uh but this was signal company no like
this voice signal company hy hynek always mentions uh cohen's company with what they're using you n yeah
voice no no voice signal they make uh recognition for these samsung phones and yeah uh they have like really s many recognisers i guess maybe definitely they may be using p l p s or you know
yeah rasta or rasta or something you mean mm yeah because mm
yeah but again
yeah too new is really definitely because like want to at least see i at least four five years of results of some new features and some consistent results or
ah uh space or ah okay

yeah yeah yeah mm
yeah
but yeah d
yeah uh another issue is like again the computational issues no if they want to make on mobile they don't want
really use some fancy really expensive computationally expensive features or all these
yeah yeah it
it's just phone recognition or something like
yeah
but most of the time mobiles they use d d t w  kind of thing no like all these uh so voice calling
yeah voice calling and these thing because that's easy like because they don't really need to put lot of uh
memory and these things otherwise if they want to build a real
yeah yeah yeah where where mm yeah yeah
yeah cohen yeah yeah
it's samsung some some new really new phone like mm
yeah but uh the software is always available or like
no the software is again on top of mobile or like it comes with your mobile
no the thing is usually these kind of these kind of facilities are like no not normal so
so they may charge more or like yeah yeah yeah ah ok yeah definitely they may charge
for more money f again some extra bill for this using this recognition engine or something
yeah
yeah
yeah

yeah but maybe like if it can't really recognise you it will be really annoying it's better
yeah i have used once like this dragon that was kind of good like yeah because
even in when i was working in uh like in edinburgh like one guy he use i he got some problem
with hands and then he was always using this n uh dictation even he used to write lot of c  plus plus code with
the dictation like it's really good like so
but you ought to really train and then you're to kind of uh yeah
i get used to the system yeah yeah it's really like you ought to get used to the system like you how to say all the callings
and this thing system how t but it's really funny like he is able to use it for like
like years i mean he used to write a lot of code and you know it's really great
yeah yeah you can listen festival
read the like
mm yeah yeah yeah fes yeah i think i think you can do the festival you can just call like uh
this there are different kind of again how you call the festival so you can just give the full
there is an too so then you will get the all the caller and other things if if you want to like
read full text then you can say like the full text like those syntax and then it will
speak till it finishes the text
yeah it's real it's yeah diphone yeah yeah that's why it's real time like otherwise it's bit difficult and
it's okay you can easily understand so it's intelligible so uh festival is good like now it
comes at all the linux boxes also so in so already in this
no the there are so many voices like again
which voice you want to use
no most of the the festival uh what you get on linux machines is diphone based only so they supply
few voices yeah yeah yeah just uh concatenation of the no it's
already there if you just put li festival it comes wi because it's comes with direct linux software and you know it is
open source festival is open
it's
yeah cat voice like there are like they they have few
yeah new voices like yeah
yeah that's the difference that tha in views this unit selection it's not diphones you have
really large inventory of the speech uh those voices they're not yet released yeah no no it's free
they'll be releasing soon i guess so maybe you can just check no i it's it's here
on the web then it won't come with your linux software so you have to again download from uh their web
page
yeah you can download now yeah yeah yeah it the voices are called multisyn multisyn uh sl uh that's some voice so you can download from the voice from the web festival
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so voice is like the database of the
parallel speaker who speaks that this text so it was really large database so it the
voi the quality will be better because you can find similar yeah it's
more or less but not exactly like uh it's two times or one point five times or something but
you can prune like how much you want because
so this is again like uh that's kind of my p h d  work how in this system like how you choose the
units and how you concatenate so there are again cost functions and viterbi so you can you can always optimise
you can put some thresholds and pruning and then you can make it real time so then again compromise uh between the
quality and yeah but still it's good like now th you can just check multisyn and then voices
uh yeah yeah it's really good
yeah yeah yeah yeah
but only sometimes like it can't really call this yeah
uh standard text yeah yeah ascii file is
ascii and but only the problem's again acronyms and sometimes it expands sometimes it may not expand
because it's not in their dictionary so yeah it's not in the dictionary like if we again it's
problem like so but those things you can add like if you're really familiar with festival so you can add always these
yeah but at least these things okay like it won't really make mistakes so often like sometimes
alan black and paul taylor they started r festival in ninety six or something edinburgh c s t r  yeah
uh f oh uh this ma this johann waters or like no they d what they did portland o g i  they did l p c  based synthesis the festival is alrea already like it's one first you start with th
ah okay
mm
from
i don't know no no actually the b
ah okay okay yeah maybe because
ah ok
hmm
yeah first they started in c s t r  with alan black and paul taylor then then it expand to many places because
if somebody is fil no simon king is he's one of the others but rob clark is the man
that you met um uh uh already yeah
it's
so anything uh more about lisbon or interspeech i it's enough yeah
okay
okay

so you start i think right
yeah so we are going to talk about the papers from interspeech this is not a good question i think all of them of course all of them of course
oh yeah that's true
okay bad answer right
like
yeah i it's not every year right
yeah we met in also in i c s l p  right the first time so yeah so how how did you like the conference anyway when in compared to to th the others the previous one
but
yeah
right
oh yeah he was from australia right the guy yeah uh he's very famous i think for that right he's the the inventor of that implant and for for the ear i think
s yeah
mm

so you went to a beach to a like atlantic sea coast or yeah
uh huh uh it's not so far from lisbon half an hour mm hmm
uh northwest mm
yeah

yeah but i think lisbon those days are pretty good like seem to me quite not cold but still okay like reasonable
oh yeah
yeah i was happy to be back in suisse after few few days it's better to be here i think yeah it's big city many people and
yeah yeah
those new only right not the old one but yeah
yeah ah it's not necessary to have it maybe some time yes but not so many days or
oh yeah yeah that's true
conference
yeah yeah
it's
better to ta
yeah

the easiest way

i don't remember the name is it there yeah i it's supposed to be there
oh you've got the s
yeah

uh huh
like
no i don
right mm hmm

yeah
so they obtain better results with that finally or
but
right but if you compare no if you compare it with some baseline let's say you use just g m m  with diagonal covariance matrices
a and no decorrelation before like uh
yeah or l d a  is there or
yeah but but there must be the sense right because once you decorrelate the data then
you don't need to have full i know that's so that's that means that the decorrelation is
not uh optimal right so so that's the reason
mm hmm
yeah yeah it is yeah
uh no there there is not
yeah
right
right right
yeah yeah
yeah yeah definitely it's almost impossible for like l v c  aside impossible to use
it right you've got dimension thirty nine times thirty nine yeah so
yeah it's impossible to use it and you cannot even train it right more or less i think
oh so that's interesting
mm hmm
much longer
shorter yeah
right
wh what is the minimum and maximum
so it's not so mm
two point five milliseconds
twenty milliseconds from
oh yeah
right sure
and the shifting is still the same or not
o yeah yeah overlap
so
like um no how many frames per per second you do have is it again
like uh one hundred frames or it's less or even if you keep variable
length of the frames right you can still keep the same frame rate
because i understand this would have sense for i don't know speech coding where you want to preserve uh or you want to encode it into less frames right but why do why to do it for speech recognition it means that uh
yeah no wha why to keep variabl variability in the length of the frames wh why not to keep the same length what is the
yeah
right
right right right
mm hmm
right right right ri right
mm hmm mm hmm mm hmm
right yes

right yeah
mm hmm
right
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm
mm hmm
well
mm hmm
yeah
yeah probably
no i don't think so
there is no information
hmm
yeah yeah yeah right right right
yeah yeah
yeah it might be difficult
mm mm hmm probably who knows maybe it's possible to use it somehow but then there is uh information about temporal information is somehow included in such yeah
yeah there is also some um like uh not paper but i saw the algorithm i have been using even that called temporal decomposition i don't know if you kn you know that like
uh i don't know who propose it i just had it from from beambot for like a beambot do you know the guy he's french
um somewhere now in teleconference like mm i don't know where he's working but th we were using it for uh speech coding
so we just had a speech and you had decompose a speech into such segments temporal segments which were stationary inside
and then you can more or less uh quantise those segments somehow and use it for encoding let's say or
and it worked prett yeah yeah
they were using like s v d  stuff singular value decomposition for that and it worked pretty well like i was surprised like yeah yeah exactly uh he was using that yeah
oh well it's it has been used for speech coding nob nobody use it for recognition stuff i think i never heard that
no i don't of course yeah that's good question maybe
right
right
mm hmm
yeah that's true
mm hmm mm hmm
mm hmm that's true
that's important
all the papers
okay

i think people wouldn't like it many people wouldn't like it

right
yeah yeah yeah sure
exactly
right and everybody's uh like uh using different training and testing data and then you don't know if like
they show it works for timit but then you try to use some different databases you see it doesn't work
yeah sure yeah yeah you can
yeah exactly yeah yeah yeah nist evaluations
yeah but nobody you know it's those new systems are still not general
like you know like those p l p  and m f c c s because everybody knows that di it worked somehow right for any kind
of data that's why they're comparing to to that so once somebody will come with something new
okay he he's showing it works for some datas but still yeah yeah
first it's difficult to to show that it works for all all the datas right because it's really
and

yeah

yeah that's your choice
mm hmm
no no i just for
yeah
i think so yeah probably mm
mm hmm
mm hmm
ri i
it's just t t s  right text to speech right
mm hmm
right right

are they for o g i s for o g i  numbers
different setups like some people use this setup and some people that

uh huh
so you just
oh yeah
no uh it's i dunno i i've been working with that and
right yeah yeah
for noise conditions yeah it's pretty good well th those f recognisers are are made there or just
you just use them that's it you don't have to play with it she even is f it was forbidden in the time right so
you have recogniser just use it don't play with it you just play with the features yeah
right exactly so
yeah yeah ri right
yeah yeah i remember with david pearce he was
yeah yeah exactly
we are using those results more or less
but not everybody go not everybody many people stay so

yeah
yeah sure but exactly
no
well many people place with tandem right like m i t  or who is using that some not m i t  but somebody
i dunno hynek told told us that somebody's using that um very actively like okay it
it works for them and and they are close to like industry like uh you know there is it's a research
group of i know i don't think it's icsi somebody else or i
don't know somebody new uh s but i think some t somebody like a t  and a t  and t  or what
oh qu yeah you me i don't know he's even if qualcomm no now y oh yeah yeah for right right no i don't know if it's
yeah i think so yeah definitely maybe they are using p l p s and but
i th i believe that there is still some stuff up to yeah for rasta or whatever else like
all those decorrelations and transformations i think it's there but more or less it's again based
on m f c c s or something like that or maybe traps
no more or less i think yeah

right
that's true it's true but that's different situation because right they
need that it doesn't create that much yeah if something happened with the machine
and uh i don't kn the alloc system it doesn't matter right somebody will fix it and change it but
sure
yeah
even even not viterbi just even something simpler yeah
uh i don't know do you think so yeah oh yeah yeah yeah yeah that's true yeah sure
yeah
even on the phone n some new one or
from that c cohen's oh uh huh
and but which uh phone it is f samsung something where uh some but some which you can buy right it's
it and you can train it like only your speech or it's general uh it's quite interesting yeah
okay uh huh
or you you can just buy that application right i don't know like it's like you you've got some mobile phone and then you can buy from another company some such application wh you can dictate your s m s  or whatever
s i don't know if it is done now but like
but have you ever used like dictation system for windows those uh there were many of them yeah drag the mouse there and i heard that it worked very very well um
alright
right newer speech okay

okay
how to say okay
mm hmm
i think yeah yeah definitely
it's based on the diphones diphones right
yeah yeah
yeah i think it's very good yeah
mm hmm
so you've got it installed in your machine here or
festival right
okay oh a and have you have you tried it
and
so you can
uh huh
mm hmm
yeah it's very difficult and
yeah yeah
and you just uh have chosen some text any text you just put in and
okay

and it can read uh how does it read from which um from which uh how to state it uh is it uh possible to read p d f s or just standard text whatever t x t  right files uh huh
yeah well let's
oh really

anyway who is the author of festival
edinburgh and i thought it that's the guy from c s l u  from portland who was there during f
yeah but there was
no no but that that was the guy who's on a wheelchair now he cannot m move even
he's very in like indic how to say that like he cannot have he just can speak
only through some festival system or something like that he was the auth no yeah h he was working i think
in w o g i  even he's very famous but i thought that he was the author no it was developed for him like
he was just first tester i think of the system something like that like it's not t
text to speech it's just the uh uh synthesis which means which is more or less
the same but i dunno
yeah so it's somebody and simon king is playing with that right the t guy
okay okay
i think that's enough
no other papers it's just one paper and and festival from linux it's very im interesting
yeah
and it's always the other way around that's how you put it on
i think the the most of the bad words are at the beginning when the people try to put in on
huh
whoo
ah i cannot put it
oh no no not at all
well geneva that's why i'm here at idiap because i attended geneva eurospeech
i c
why why you cannot
mm hmm exactly
meet
okay so you attended mostly posters i guess so how many presentation you you
i realised it were that there were panel discussions only at the place where i could see the the t t
you know there were some boards saying that there is some panel discussion uh but i i couldn't get
no one knew where is it what it is where it happens and why and so forth it was com
yeah finally i found but
well this is not this speech is not restricted only to papers and these things you know so how did you like lisbon then
yeah
yeah w we went to the costa caparica there with the bus we we were we were supposed to take take the direct one but we didn't
north
okay so you stayed at the at the same coast not not you didn't go to the island cross the river where where is the bridge and and then okay so that was a different place
yeah with hamed uh hemant and these people
the more south to th the hole through the water

huh
i was
i was very surprised that even the trams did have a a c  there i couldn't see
it at at all yeah r right but can you imagine something like in
uh it's a c 
well it it was much better if if if you would have to spend a
hour and a half that uh hemant and the others spent while going with a ca uh with a bus
to to the conference centre from from the the hotel that we were there was a direct
bus and it took them hour and a half then mm
yeah
yeah that was the right choice but to take something which which was uh direct in quotes it was n not the f direct as anything else but
uh it sounds sounds like
let's go on this was just a
of what
pruning of covariance matrix
but what what does it mean tied then
uh yeah but then you have to store the whole matrix and plus some extra information what is tied to what or b
yeah but
uh i don't know about anything like this but
tying
mm
but ooh the the main point is to to uh like make it faster the the the decoding or what
well that's possible why why it should be i impossible
so it's completely impossible to do it with full covariance matrix why
yeah computationally e expensive but
of course from the point of view of computation but otherwise it's there's no problem no with okay
okay so so here you have to choose either many many things to store and huge computation uh
yeah yeah no uh depends
so
so there are no results there no
hmm yeah
uh huh
yeah
yeah
mm hmm
okay
why it has to be online
okay
like extended as as more as much as possible to keep the okay
of course of course
whoo yeah it's right
this is maybe because of f f t u  or these things it's no not as small as as it should have been but mayb maybe because of other processing after no
yeah well noisy yes
overlap you mean
uh w how do you mean to say
uh
um i have two questions first is essentially how he's doing in that no
well uh once he gets the frame like from here to here then where he advances to to
start with c computation of the next frame
yeah mm hmm
okay
okay
okay mm hmm
fu ok okay so do what do you mean full some some sub window or the the whole ten seconds of speech or what
it has to be also some somehow
okay something longer window than the one we are speaking about okay
uh w
okay so you have a window and then you split it to s two parts and you shift the the point where you split it or okay
okay splitting point okay
okay
okay so basically we have two fixed points
yeah okay
okay
okay so once you have say one hour of speech you start at the beginning and first you try with twenty milliseconds then you shift to twenty five and so forth until you
okay and and you find the point where where what where where do you stop actually yeah mm i know but you start at twenty and go to sixty but where which point do you choose
uh okay but which which likelihood ratio
okay
yeah but uh likelihood that's something and something w what is likelihood
okay
yeah but it has to yeah
okay
so it's basic
so
mm yeah
yeah but still if
mm
yeah but why do the main value which are comparing to the the
the overall value or overall likelihood or whatever you call it why he's using
the whole signal for this because so if the whole signal was uh steady somehow and
it it would be able to be modelled by l p  model well then the residue will be very low
so he's supposing that the whole signal won't be able to
to be captured by l p  model and that the residue would be high enough or ho wh why
he's comparing the o to to the overall
you know i i don't see the point of dividing over the the whole stuff
y well sounds sounds reasonable
i see i see i see
okay that's reasonable because actually if it if if uh the whole signal would be able to
be modelled by l  uh by l p c  then anyway he has to design some some framing so
even if it's very stationary by d um by dividing over this whole stuff
he is able to find some reasonable boundaries um m ma makes sense
um
okay and
mm
that has to be power not energy definitely no
yeah but it has to be normalised by the length then power instead of energy energy over length is power
yeah yeah duh duh duh duh duh okay so but this
so two things i still don't understand thi this is supposed to be only for m f c c s and these easy features
ah one question i i wanted to ask before does does he preserve within the feature vector
the framing he's using finally because does he somehow put the information about was the size
about the frame to the feature vector itself or he's throwing away this framing
something like this because the recogniser could be good for the recogniser to know what was the chosen framing by this extraction
okay
so so it n uh it might be bad for then for the back end it might screw up the the t speech rate or normaliser
huh
oh probably i didn't get it too so the framing is actually equi distant just the windows are wider oh ah i see because it would be crazy yeah a little bit
oh i see so so it's it's like this

yeah i cannot imagine the transformation to get the modulation spectrum out of such a stuff uh
mm
so why don't you still use it if it works so well
yeah but you do the speech coding so do you still use it why
mm
uh
uh it's interesting this

well there should be after each conference there should be something like ten people should sit down
read the papers and then rank them you know a all the all the all the similar papers within
one session say sp uh focus to this topic and say this is the best this works
slightly worse than this one and throw away what is not that good and and th the first three
three papers which are the best shou should be implemented and used from from that time onwards
like forget the all the m f c c s because it's too old and then start building
the story on the new stuff and not 'cause it's
yeah it is but i know i know uh th this is just a theory
because
mm yeah
yes and i want to yeah
yeah
it looks like
mm
yeah
yeah because to me it seems that everyone is still comparing to p l p s or m f c c s and there are so many new systems and everything is new but it baseline is still uh t twenty years old and
yeah
uh yeah
no okay so
so it should be every papers then should contain all the results from nist evaluation or some standard task then otherwise
uh uh that's the other yeah
okay so it could be you you would have to publish the results on this standard task and then you could say well i also tried on this and this
yeah you know but then then only it makes some progress this
mm
yeah but can for for example can you use from some data from from the l t  world for training say
yeah but they give you also training data or only the testing data
oh i uh since this is only okay
okay so so they give you only the training or development data only mm hmm yeah

hmm
mm


hmm
mm hmm
mm

uh
al almost yeah we are a couple of people at idiap and there are already two s two different setups
stories and numbers or
yeah uh i think we use di distinct train and test set even se the different sets of phonemes different
well i don't use only digits my m l p s are trained on everything and uh test set is digits yeah

for for what
ah
yeah
yeah you cannot play with that because of the voices wouldn't be comparable then
uh
hmm because who is the one who makes who actually uses what we d try
to do here these are companies or because it's not scientists scientists just start from p l p  and
then design the new features new back end or new anything but they start from the old stuff
but who is the one who is using these results which we publish and try to make
yeah but once you once you finish your p h d  you go and it's over
and those who don't they stay and publish another papers and they but they they don't turn into a
life no into life
mm uh huh

because
i i won
yes i wonder which level they are using out of what is there
hmm
yeah
they grab
hmm
hmm
okay so we can hope that nokia will be using tandem tandem p l p s
yeah i cannot
huh so it's not related to icsi
yeah but it was
mm
hmm
hmm
hmm because they grab whatever is certain to work and they they use it they don't use anything which is to uh too new which is not that safe
it's like a it's like a nasa you know they use four eight four eight six
machines to to to to put two n uh space ships because
it's it's known to work perfectly well or pentium not any p  four or whatever because
it's safe it has been working for twenty years and then only it safe to put well not twenty but
it's always yeah yeah of course
of course
mm yeah
mm
hynek also told about this cohen ce cell phone which he was showing to to work l uh with
the l v c s r  he he was saying that there is something really really uh simple the
decoder i mean not the features but he was mentioning something to the decoder this is just there is almo
yeah something like no d t w  or something i don't know i'm not really sure but he mention that
hmm
that was impressive
yeah but it's that's a similar one to what herve has for example some he was showing it uh live on m l m i  c last m l m i  conference you can look at the video and play it uh
it uh i'm not sure
yes commercial phone
what do you mean always
well they they just bought a mobile and based on the o s  it's using they they they developed the software
no this is the development phone this is not the commercial stuff with the software they just use the device
by by what
i don't know if it's already the case right now
you had to get used to the system not the system to you
it's nice by the way you should be the one to ask is there anything
if i'm just a p private person and i want for free any software which is able to read me
a book in english uh for example that festival am i able to put the text to the system
and to in real time to listen to the output festival is able
to to to read just a mm normal plain text in reasonable
comprehensible english or so that i can understand it non native speaker
mm okay
yeah
and it's in real time on a reasonable machine
okay
okay
'cause the the diphone that i was tried to install it and there there are the voices like cat voice and these
voices this is not the one because uh i don't know which which um
what i what is running where uh if it's diphone or which uh approach this is
yes so it's uh just uh wha samples of the diphones and it choo chooses
yeah on my on my laptop or here
yeah you can you can easily yes i d i've tried but there are some built in
like easy voices which you can y uh there is a default one completely synthetic which you cannot
understand at all and th then there is a diphone synthesis i think it is the diphone synthesis
from the some like something like cat w voice and somethi this is so so
but it's this doesn't sound very nice and we were playing at the uh summer school with them actually with the authors
and they were playing us some other other approaches and it it sounded like a human
it was great but
yeah
so this is not this is not for free or something
but it it's not here so far
okay i'm i'm fine with this but i can make it run on my machine okay
okay
and and the engine is is in the festival itself so it's just a voice to to okay
okay
mm hmm
mm mm
okay
hmm
mm hmm
hmm
okay
uh it's right i mean
yeah i just s use the douglas adams uh uh that that book you know the mm how it's called just general english textbook i i cho i tried
no the t  t x t  yeah ascii file basically you have to but you can take a p d f  and convert p d f  to ascii
yeah it was a line with hashes and it was hash hash hash hash hash hash hash hash hash hash
uh i'm not then i don't want to go too much into details just a little bit
mm well i can prepare s sorry
these are the edinburgh people no
mm hmm yeah voice that i know um uh
n uh

n uh
mm
at this precise time yeah

uh you can't attend multiple session at the same time so

hmm
mm hmm yeah in
hmm
yeah
hmm
yeah
hmm
but yeah
yeah i liked the invited speaker um about the implant in the ear it's quite good no
i think so yeah
yeah
mm


hmm
hmm
no quite good uh a bit hot still but the bea the beach nearby is quite nice yeah you should try it i don't know did you go around before or after yeah
okay
yeah 'cause i
yeah i stayed i stayed two days before so uh i went you ju you just take the train maybe that's the same i'm not sure train north half an hour train yeah yeah west or north i don't know uh
no no no not very far no no it's different yeah
yeah
yeah
hmm

hmm
well y
we can take the tram and a train it's it's all conditioned yeah
ah
mm
ah sorry
no no no it's uh or s i'm not sure
yeah
yeah originally i brought it because i marked some papers but yeah
onl only o one which surprised me a bit it was uh speaker recognition i think but
it doesn't really matter they were trying to model uh um covariance of different
components for g m m  instead of using a diagonal but then if you use
a full it's too much so they use some approach where they tie them automatically and
uh after that well it's more like tying
it is still full but different um components are tied different components
of the matrix are tied
equal
uh
no no you have to store a minimum number a reduced number of parameters and they are tied in a linear way actually sorry not equal but it doesn't
yeah exactly that's it uh so they ju yeah
yeah
interesting thing is that they applied it on speaker recognition and on the features before they had three different
ways to um decorrelate the features and and this they showed it uh
without this with diagonal g m m  or with this and with this with uh semi tied
covariance matrices it was a less much less sensitive to uh which um
decorrelation procedure you choose if y so
a a also better but of course it depends on the number of of parameters you put
yeah
yeah yeah i i think i think it was even slightly better yeah
maybe i can find it
l d a  yeah l d a 
make it possible to use uh a full covariance matrix
yeah


yeah it's this one
it's i improved covariance modelling
yeah
no but in the proceedings you can find them they are better yeah they tried p c a  l d a  m l l t 
i i it's not really anything new but uh the mm they just applied that to speaker i d  yeah yeah


i isn't it smaller the minimum no
i don't know i just
mm

mm
yeah okay but it's not uh an intrinsic limitation it's just because of ri yeah
okay
so it's not n it's not symmetric necessarily 'kay
so he's maximising that or mm
mm mm hmm
hmm
yeah
mm
okay
mm hmm
yeah ho yeah how did you cope with what you mentioned some time before that if it's a very
long session for each twelve point five frame you will actually
get the same segment now so how d
ah okay
mm hmm
mm
sorry mm uh what it's a little bit what nist is trying to do no so
yeah bu
yeah but then we all optimise uh on the same task
so you cannot get anything new out of that after some time
yeah but then you run out of time no i ideally you're correct uh but
mm
so yeah ho how how do they how do they evaluate i just don't know
so they ask peop they ask people to sit and listen basically yeah
hmm
okay but they d they don't have any measure like you have an original speech you transcribe it and
okay
hmm
hmm
hmm
mm
so maybe well but then well no if somebody like nist will have one recogniser and you just plug a different feature but uh it's dangerous
right
mm
hmm yeah yeah
hem hemant is using difference
seems
hmm
mm
yeah
would be mm would be nice for aurora maybe to have that aur aurora yeah
no no but yeah yeah
mm
hmm
yeah
hmm

yeah daimler yeah
i don't know you know they're extremely secretive i had a hard time just to get the signals so i asked other questions but uh it's quite tough yeah yeah

yeah they have to yeah
they have yeah they have to do some test in their mercedes some speech recognition test mm but
it seems now they mm at least daimler they mostly work on dialogue management uh but
not much on features and recognition
no
yeah i d i mm i doubt they are trying right now i doubt that at daimler they are trying right now but maybe other companies mm
uh

cohen
jorda jordan cohen
no no
mm
mm
but there you could send an s m s  i think or something like that uh you could dictate text so on a phone yeah
the phone that uh cohen yeah voice signals
yeah
i don't know that's
okay
hmm
so it's still still real time
hmm
ah okay but but not much yeah
yeah yeah
alright yeah yeah

yeah

okay
mm hmm
what's the agenda for this meeting
okay
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm
mm
yeah
that's the big question yeah
no i don't i wasn't
no
i c i can talk about it but i have no slides or anything
mm hmm well i've just been um presented with some research we've done in a small focus group so a hundred people just asked them about their remote control usage habits and what they want in a remote control um
it's probably can't email this to you i've just got a web page with some data on it um basically it's saying that
users generally dislike the look and feel of their remote controls um seventy five u seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly um
eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy um
current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user uh seventy five percent
of users said they zap a lot so they use their remote control quite frequently while they're watching television uh fifty percent
of users say that they only use ten percent of the buttons so they've got a remote control with a lot of functionality but
really most of the time they only use a small part of that
um
i have an a web page yes
yep yep sure
mm hmm so basically um there's a breakdown of how much they use the different functions on a rem remote control
um power and volume selection are only used a few times within this
uh per hour um channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times um
and then there's things like channel settings audio settings which are only used very infrequently um teletext
is used um fourteen times in the hour so it is used but not nearly as much as the channel
selection is used um
an interesting thing that this report has brought up is that um fifty fifty percent of users
report that the remote control gets lost a lot of the time in the room so some way of some way of locating the remote
control would be very useful to a lot of users um thirty four percent
said it takes too long to learn to use a remote control they want something that's easier to use straight away more intuitive perhaps
um
thirty four percent said it took too much time to learn to use a new one yep
um and thirty twenty six percent said remote controls are bad for r s i  i don't know how we'd go about combating that for r s i  respet repetitive strain injury
so but
mm
yeah that's what the report says yeah um and then it's got a demographic breakdown on
uh i should be able to actually if i email it to you now
oh no yeah
yeah um s hang on
well
oh i need to muck around with this it's probably easier if you put it on yours and then i'll just email it to you it's just a web link
one thing it goes on to talk about which is interesting is the hang on a minute
mm hmm
yep um one thing is interesting is talking about
um speech recognition in a remote control
and who would pay more for that and whether people would find it useful
yes i'll just get this up
well potentially yeah um
i think even for interesti yeah i think that would not work so well you wanna have both options
mm hmm
mm
yeah
mm
yeah
um
well
this is now talking about um who would pay for speech recognition in a remote control who would pay more for it um
ninety percent of the fifteen to twenty five year old market said that they would pay more it goes down from there seventy six
percent for twenty five to thirty five thirty five percent for thirty five to forty five um twenty two percent
for forty five to fifty five and then eight percent for fifty five to sixty five yeah but we sh
yeah it really depends where we're gonna be targeting this product um which we'll be talking about
later i think
did you get the email
yep that one just follow that link
it'll be in a different window yep
that's left that one
yep
mm so that's the figure that i was just talking about there with the different demographics another thing it's talking about there is the l c d  screen but there's no figures apparently on that
sorry oh
mm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm
mm hmm
well

you drew it a long time ago
ninety one

ah

that's handy so if the b t v  in the next apartment's really loud you can just turn it off
yeah
i like that idea

mm hmm
yep
mm hmm
okay how would that work so you've got say maybe a v c r  and a t v  which are separate so you on my one at home
i've got a v c r  remote which then changes the channel on the v c r  and doesn't do anything on the t v  so is it gonna
be like a switch on the remote that says t use the t v  or use the v c r  or does it know which one you want to use
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
yeah
mm
yeah
that's fair enough
mm but i don't think we're trying to make a universal remote here that's yeah
mm
mm because y
mm hmm
mm
mm
yep
mm
mm
yeah
mm hmm
mm
mm
mm hmm
mm hmm
hmm
mm
mm
so d v d s and v c r s mm
mm hmm
mm hmm


mm hmm
mm
mm hmm
mm
mm
mm but i think taking the idea of getting inspiration from mobile phones is interesting especially if we're going after
a younger market that's the the the mm the new and the funky things that's yeah there's lot there's
lots of pretty mobile phones not too many pretty remote controls that's
mm
mm hmm
okay
how much longer have we got for the meeting by the way 'cause we haven't talked about demographic at all and it's a very important issue
mm hmm
mm
mm
mm
mm
yeah which i think is quite tricky um basically we're trying to get people to buy a remote control wouldn't they already have a remote control with their television when they buy one
but it's not going to have more functionality 'cause it's only a low market it's a cheap end remote control we can't beat modern functionality
we might we'll be able to beat them on th the look of it th the design of it but that's not a big seller if
they're not just going to buy a new remote control just 'cause it looks pretty they have to actually need it as well so i'm not
sure how we can get people to buy this thing
mm
yeah but why are they buying one in the first place
mm but if people are buying a new remote control for functionality they'll buy a universal remote i've got friends who've got
so many things they need a universal remote otherwise they're using five different remotes for their all their things in that case they wouldn't buy
our product because it doesn't give them what they need in terms of functionality
well we can't with the price range we we're not building a universal remote we're not building a high end product
mm
mm hmm
mm
but yeah
if we're getting into universal remote territory we're getting to l c d  screens and things like that which would drive the cost up a lot
for universal remotes
if you mm
and quite complicated to use yes
mm hmm not as flexible maybe yeah but s yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
but if we're going for the say fifteen to twenty five age group then not many of them would actually own t v s to use a remote control on
okay so they're yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm yep
i don't know really what the the price range for remote controls is are we gonna be at the very bottom of the price range or are we kind of middle to bottom i don't know
mm
mm hmm
mm
mm hmm
mm
yeah
yeah so i guess what i'd like from a universal remote is maybe choosing between three devices being able to switch between them there may be stereo v c r  and t v 
and just be able to s use them all from the same remote but not at the same time
mm
mm hmm yep
mm hmm
mm hmm
so i see all everybody's here 'kay
and we can start meeting
the i will uh
present here agenda with with with with slides
to you um
as you can see here
so first uh just to mention i will
take notes uh of this meeting and uh i will try to work them out and give them to you i've also made
notes of the previous meeting and um i was about to send them you but then
uh i had to go to this uh meeting so you will get them too uh
um
yes indeed
um
then i hope you all have uh worked out some some uh
some some presentations about uh about well you the the task given to you
in the previous meeting um w we will uh
in a minute we will uh start with them um
we will see in which order we will handle them of um then i will uh bring in some
some some new requirements i i got uh from the uh account manager i try to work
them out they were quite abstract and we can have maybe have com some discussion about it uh um
about the functions and well in this meeting we should really try to reach
a decision about the target group
and the functionality of the
yes i mean well yes w who are we going to uh to well to sell this the customers indeed yes
think that's that's important matter
uh so and then uh we will close this meeting uh and after this meeting we'll uh we'll have a lunch good
um
maybe um
why uh anna can you c do you have a presentations you don't have presentation
uh you want a table to to uh
yes yes maybe maybe you can uh can just talk about it or maybe you can use the whiteboard if necessary um
mm hmm
mm
do you do you have this uh information on the web page you said
yes mayb maybe you can can send an email to me later uh
uh about this
mm
mm
yes yes i have that too
mm
mm
they think that or do their doctor the doctor says but it's it's the opinion of the uh of the users huh
so mm
you can maybe just just



hmm
mm hmm
d do you have numbers o o on that

well it would it would be a solution for uh when your
remote control is lost i mean when it has speech recognition then
uh i then it doesn't matter where it is my well it's we should be in range or maybe it can respond and produce sound so say where it is but the these are all quite fancy features i'm not sure whether
we will we can make this for for twelve euro fi and fifty cents
mm
yes that that that that's mm
do you have some more important facts or
can we go to the next presentation
mm
mm hmm decline with age mm
mm
yes we will talk about it later okay


mm okay um
uh maybe uh mael c c can you give uh uh your presentation uh
oh this is
mm hmm y y you can move uh
yes you can you can sa take my chair
mm
mm hmm
mm hmm
uh huh
is huh
overwhelming
no
and and why do you want these kind of component i mean are they cheap or are they uh reliable what were your
mm
yes
it it
it's more clear now i think
so
mm hmm
what i w what i was thinking about uh the the the schema uh about uh the sender and the receiver i mean can you can you get back to it
yeah uh the receiver is of course already in the television and we are not uh
able to change it so we we must adapt to the to the receiver i i suppose there is a standard
uh way of communicating to televisions uh
mm hmm
mm mm mm mm
yes okay
thank you
mm
yeah yes i i i
i i feel i i i think m mael will will consider this uh th these things maybe maybe we can go to to your presentation uh matthew i i i assume you were finished here uh okay
oh i
uh sorry i know where it is
it's uh
yes
it's uh

mm hmm
mm
mm mm mm mm mm
mm yes but i think it's i i it's already there i mean the hard disk uh recorders uh i i've seen them in the shop
w w w w we need to decide on on on on in how far we go to in this
mean you can go pretty far i f i think with with with functions and possible uh future p uh prospects yes
but it's good to keep in mind
mm very well
good

um
so u um i have uh received some some some some well points of of thinking over of my account manager and uh i would like to share them with you um
first thing is uh teletext is a well known feature of televisions but it's it's getting used less and less
that's that's especially because of the internet of course so we should think
about it um do we include it and do we give it a prominent uh prominent uh
place on on on the on well huh
on the remote mot control itself
uh as uh a in any case it's it's not used well very much but it's it is still used um
further yes we must think uh do we stay uh to to television only the television as we as
we all know it with with broadcasting signals and you can't go back uh
huh or do we uh uh go further as matthew indicated by supporting uh uh
recording uh devices
uh indeed indeed and and and the hard disk recorders
um furthermore uh w we need really need to interest
uh y younger customers and then with younger customers i mean people
uh below the age of forty
and our our current customers are mainly forty plus uh which well forty
so that's to that's i mean there's a market but uh they will grow older older and you'll al always need to have the the future with younger people um therefore
younger people like trendy trendy designs so that's w we should
make our our our r c  as trendy as possible but
it should also be uh have a reliable image so when it looks too too spacey or too fancy people will think well does it work at all
hmm
ma maybe maybe you can draw it on the on the board uh
hmm
yes yes mo
yes it's recognisable
mm mm
and and they are skilled uh by using it
mael can you hand me over this uh
uh thank you
mm well i think fi five min mm hmm
okay
'kay i i think now that the idea's clear uh we should now uh try to decide um on our target group
of course they have already one so our our our remote control has to be better
mm hmm
mm i well i think many people said uh in your in in your research uh uh
uh the appearance of the uh r c  is is important when they are buying one but
indeed
so that will be about
functionality
mm mm hmm mm
so your you think we should go for a more u universal high performance
what do what do you think about what componen
i don't know i don't know whether that's necessary is the l c d  screen
i think thi this could be this could be a market because uh universal remote controls uh tend to be uh quite expensive
s so we can try to go in between and offer a product which is not as expensive and not as
complicated
but but still but still people have the idea this is more functional than a normal uh uh
r c  because it has more uh it it is in some kind universal

mm yes but w we're targeting i think on more on the on the twenty to forty group
people yes who just have or already have a job and have the money but
may not want to spend that much money on a on a universal universal control
uh well

i think uh when we think it over i thi i think we are trying to offer the a kind of universal control for for less money
so d do you agree
mm hmm you think it's possible for the twelve euro fifty
okay
um so
then we we decide on on on going to this more universal kind of control
mm mm okay
yes
mm mm mm mm
so given we are going for this uh
uh universal type uh m maybe it is good when you try to find out which components
you therefore need and y you will try to get more specific uh user interface
content and uh maybe you can look on on what trends are in this uh in this type of market
so anyone uh has a point to bring in or shall we no
okay
w yes we uh we can have lunch now so um
then th
th the next meeting will uh after lunch you have uh we have
uh thirty minutes of work and then we have the next meeting but you will be informed via the computer okay
okay
okay

next



what do you mean there
okay
you can disconnect it there no
then you can connect this one or this one yeah
all to your computer
oh yeah
okay
hmm
yeah

well it would be f
no you can't
oh
well it depends you know like
there is uh it's a very small vocabulary that you want to do the operations like you want to say on off
one two
twenty three yeah it's it's going to be li it's not going to be s so easy but
u usually it's going to be more of an isolated
case but it's but i don't know with twenty fi
okay it's uh decline okay

okay
now you can move i think yeah
it's a channel selection a module this and this function go to the
yeah
but is it uh can you just buy it on the market and f plug it in or you want to ma
well it to du it's just you had to change the frequencies
yeah

but you should be careful people are sometime becoming problem like a guy has recently
designed a remote uh uh uh which could switch off any other t v s
so basically through all the things so maybe we should think of
yeah
yeah so you can just go on the street and then switch off everyone's t v  and you can just walk away you don't have to be near the t v  at all

yeah so
okay so i can take i think mine now
there okay so voila hmm
i can take mine it's okay voila mm so
mm
okay
it's on the desktop
technical function okay
like so well so um i'm going to talk a little bit about the technical function
so wha what actually it's about what is the user going to do i think my last presented
what is going inside so what's the user is going to see from the outside and how he is going to use it
so well the approach is that uh
basically the idea is to send a message to the t v  set as mael has pointed and it will be decoded by the t v 
and usually we it is easier to have uh keys or buttons with which people
can uh press and then um changing a button will basically
uh change the message which is being sent to the t v  and uh um a and
basically it sends an internal signal and decoded by the receiver
so p as um anna has said that this ki people are interested in
things which are you don't need to k press the keys people are can have a speech recognition but this is
uh s a question which will we have to see later but in the present scenario is
that you have certain keys and you press it like your mobile phone and it sends
a message to the t v  and um so generally
mm i don't have some figures sorry but um so there are two kinds of uh remote if you popularly
in the household actually so you have a standard t v  remote where you have just a on off button and play
uh volume change and uh keys for the number and more than one digit option
and if you see for example righ right now uh uh even the one uh on more than one digit
option is for two digit channel which is like ninety nine but tomorrow you might have
one fifty channels you know to browse or two hundred channels to browse who knows but uh uh then
there is uh this is the standard one with without any fancy thing you know like i it doesn't have teletext
option it can without any it's a very simple thing um which which you can vouch
and then you have uh what's the v video remote file which is like
usually it has almost all the keys over there and but it then it has other options like stop uh
and then you play the movie or uh or fo fast forward the movie or something like
that so i it has those so these are the standard uh commonly found
remote controls in the uh market
and then whi which is generally used by the people and then well personal preferences
i would uh basically think of having a kind of aim for the next generation
thing where the we could have both the uh the f a t v  and the remote
video remote control because uh some of the keys in the video's remote control and the t v  they could be integrated
together so that uh we could um aim for the like in the f coming future
um that type of uh applications with

yeah
yeah
um actually um you could you could think of um having s a y
you can have a key which could tell y it could go to the video thing but um uh
yo you you you still can't um in that case when it you use that the function should
be able to take up the v c r  option and you could play it or you can also think about having
like um
i in a few days you will be ha in in few ye coming years you might even have a system where you have
a separate uh sitting setup box and uh you have uh um something like uh uh
you do you do you suppose you are not able to watch some programme and actually it downloading all the time for you and
uh you can just you know uh when you come back you could just switch on that thing and uh watch
a program in that case you want to browse faster browse slow you want to have those kind of functionalities
it's the next generation thing but it is going to come in couple of years it's goi
yeah it's
yeah
yeah so it's going to record your things and you and you you need basically the functionalities what you need in both uh uh video as well as in the standard t v  thing
no no we are not making a universal remote we are just looking at uh giving a scenario i have a t v  and tomorrow i am going to have set up box which is going to sit there and uh it's going to do that job for me
yeah so
okay so that p ends my presentation
well so we can always discuss about it for example uh the presently the
video market actually uh this demand video over demand or what we call it as
it's presently booming up actually so it i like people are providing
like uh things like uh uh movies you can select actually so
you want to watch a movie and uh your p your provider gives a list of movies and then you select those list
and it basically you go off it downloads the movie it gives for you and then when you come you want to
loo watch it on your t v  and thi this is going to come
yeah it can be streamed online for you and you can say what time i want to watch the movie and
yeah so
yeah
yeah
um

yeah it's uh well you you can follow the ideas how you want to keep the keys
you know right now if you take it you have like zero one two three like a keys separately
but suppose if you take the the present trend of mobile phones there
are like big thick keys you press on the top it takes one number you press on the bottom it takes another number
and uh basically uh uh so the space covered so that you don't see two separate
keys there actually so it it is like uh um i i it is like uh
yeah so
so for example uh
well uh
okay it works fine so for example you have uh presently uh keys like one two
three like this actually and uh uh four five six like that and uh you can have keys like this in form like
uh keys like that
forty minutes
yeah so you you you can have uh keys like uh which are which are like so
too sorry so we basically don't change the uh original order of them
but then the keys are more spacious they don't look uh so there there is a very
sligh thing so if you press on the top it takes the one it takes the three uh
four sorry four here uh five and six so the keys can be
it looks you know not very much cluttered but it looks nice for you don't
have too many keys but you can have a lot of options t if you press on the to
yeah
yeah

mm hmm
well
well i it's fine with me like the price as long as it is uh not too expensive
uh and it d uh
our provin
mm
uh yeah that's that's what we needed basically
uh that's needed right now and uh basically you can look to the standards of other
actu
yeah
yeah you can also browse through all the standards you know where are the limit of standards for all of them and you can just browse through them
okay okay
voila
hmm
so
well
oh i don't have anything right now we can we'll we'll go and we'll i'm sure we'll up something good for the
yeah so we meet in well what are our
okay cool so see you later
yep

perfect
so y you are the secretary also right okay
perfectly yeah yeah of course uh huh
you mean the social target group who we wants to target
oh the customers okay

it's it's easy to learn or how do you say it's
okay too much time to learn okay
not enough
maybe y y you cannot put this webpage online on the
ah it's it okay it's a webpage on the c  it's a file okay o otherwise you yeah
you can connect this one
yeah
so these are important numbers that matthew and i need to take into account for our functional um
yeah
yeah these numbers have have to be have to be taken into account
for the uh both yeah user interface and functional design
because if there are many numbers and we need to select to to constraint uh our design based on what is more important
speech recognition in
ah okay
so that we don't do we not need any button on the remote control it would be all based on speech okay
interesting idea
okay
yeah
yeah
yeah
and we don't know where the state of the art of speech recognition is maybe you know
but it's quite noisy if there is the t v  uh shouting
okay
so you had to to to summarise maybe the
mm
mm hmm

i thi you us yeah yeah
okay perfect
 
mm 'kay
yeah
mm i okay i stay
i can move as far as
maybe i take your chair i okay
so i think as everybody knows uh i'm the uh industrial designer
and uh in this presentation uh this group presentation um
is gonna focus on the working design of the the remote control um i'd like first to give
a quick a very simple introduction how does it work so that everybody knows even if you
don't have a very uh technical background uh what is it because i think in the product it is important
so basically um the basic function of a remote control is to send uh messages to
another system that is fixed and so an energy source feeds an
integrated circuit the chip that can compose messages usually uh through a um
infrared bit and uh the user interface controls the chip and accordingly
the the messages alright
so my method for um designing the yeah the work
design uh yeah first the the main point is that i would
wish to to make a really functional product i would prefer to have very functional
um capabilities rather than fancy stuff that in fact is not used and doesn't work so
for that yeah as it's important to take into account the user requirements from the marketing uh
expert uh anna and um
w to to we should agree on what are the technical functions uh for this
remote control and i show you the the working design so um
basically uh here is a really large view of what we want
uh we want an on off button it can be uh it's simple but it's it's important
and also uh the to both channels as well as other buttons
that come after right
so the components i quickly draw here is that in this part you
have the remote control the the sender and on the other part the receiver
so that's my method is um will be to well my aim would be to
uh design the and choose the chips and the infrared um components to build
the remote control right
so of course we need energy sources and uh uh the receiver a a receiver this is very quick uh design uh you stop me or interrupt me if uh you don't agree on it on that
and um so what i have found and after a lot of work actually i
i draw this i draw for you this uh schema that can
be maybe too technical for you but is very important for me you know and
uh that's it so i won't go into details about that but uh these are my preferences
to use uh that kind of components
so
so the the main components you see here are the cheapest i have found and
yeah th you have always a compromise with uh reliability and uh i if it's expensive but uh this one was not this one also really uh reliable um so
yeah that's it for the working design uh i hope you get clearer view on uh what what a remote control is uh in terms of uh technical components but maybe yeah
no no no no we we will uh this is a preference but we can always change uh
yeah
of course yeah
yeah we will use uh infrared protocol uh using yeah infrared and uh
and of course we need to adapt to that protocol that already exists and but we what we
can do is uh uh adapting the the chips inside uh to the best
uh chips and uh infrared bubbles
um okay
the frequencies yeah yeah of course yeah in the chip you have it yeah
that can control o other things
yeah
of course yeah we should take that into account in the uh

yes
okay
mm hmm
yep
these are kind of next generation functionalities
mm 'kay
mm hmm
yeah
yeah
or even you don't need to download it it's streamed uh online uh yeah yeah
yeah
mm hmm
fourteen or for o okay so

mm hmm
yeah
because they are already used to that you know product yeah
mm hmm
 
yes



mm hmm
yep

yeah we have yeah twelve point five euros uh per uh
per r  s r c  and i think uh with this now you know that chips are very uh
cheaps and uh we can include it in our control some new
new features yeah
and um but yeah that's
ye
i don't think l c d  is not necessary well th for long term
yeah
universal
yeah
mm

yeah
yeah because we have to take into account that we are gonna b we are gonna sell uh four aro around four
million so when we speak about these numbers uh the price of a chip
is uh price of a chip is very cheap so i'm okay for
designing um a ne uh less yeah a a kind of universal uh r c 
yeah
yeah
yeah that's needed yeah and if we want to get the market we really need that
yes
exactly
is that okay for you yeah
yeah
yeah
yes
oh that's that's fine then
yeah
okay perfect
hello uh this meeting we are it's fo should be focused on the conceptual design of the remote control
um the goal of this meeting is to reach a decision at the end on the concept
and i think the last time we talked about an a lot and we had a rough idea of
what is going to be but uh in th at the end of this meeting we have to
to reach a decision
so uh
we will have again three presentation from all of you and uh i hope it will be fast because i would like to have time to
for long discussion and
and decisions so who wants to start
okay
so start uh

uh
this one
turn
hmm
okay

like a sponge yeah


yeah uh yeah easy to use is it uh
a as much as important than technology or fancy thing it's less important right
yeah yeah
okay

so hamed can you
mm hmm
um number three
this one

so it's not this one
okay

yeah
this one yeah
oh
oops
can you fit any uh for example a t f t  or any electronic device in a spongy thing or is there any problem for that for example put electronic card on a spongy thing i can i can imagine it could be a problem
yep
okay so
okay maybe put electronic in a box and a spongy thing around maybe after
yeah

no i don't think it's seven by seven i think it's seven the diagonal is seven usually when they say seven inch i think it's the diagonal yeah i dunno i dun i dun one each but yeah
let's go
so let's cut the t f t 
mm
these technical engineers huh

what user wants he wants a small remote control or uh uh with big buttons it's difficult a sm
so maybe you can finish your presentation and afterwards we will discuss about all this
that's it okay so
no
uh so i think we have a lot we have to take decision today so i think we have to do some work
to finalise our idea and take decisions uh first
i think energy it's a key problem because uh it depend
what can we have as feature if we use only batteries for example or something like
that because can we have l c d  and speech recognition with battery and
it's also r related to the size of the of the devi of the device
okay so okay
uh like but using how many batteries for example are are what maybe what is the size of the battery
okay uh one two
okay
the television lights

at least when there is t v  you can get light from the t v  i dunno
okay mm
at least it's new and maybe technology new technology yeah
um
so i think before talking about the other thing it's important thing it's the case
uh what what are gonna be the size because its weight drives the other what we are going to use as features and
so on for example for the for the l c d  if we choose to have a small device we
cannot use this um a such a a a screen
oh
i've i s i think the easiest thing would be to to have a smaller l c d  if it's possible
okay so we are agree with a small
l c d 
yeah
tactile or something yeah touch screen yeah
yeah
the problem is we have a limit in a month of time so we cannot do something very new
so let's go for a small l c d 
yeah okay
so five by s ten
um so what about so the case we talked about um
something easy to use you said something easy to use but how does that fit in a fashion way like
with fruit and vegetable and about the colour and logo of the
of the company and so on now can we do that
my first idea is because
our colour is more yellow and the it should be easy to take in a hand i thought about banana or something like that which is fruits and
a big banana
um
yeah yeah but it's just an idea i dunno what you think about but
yeah
i dunno if it can fit with the technology you are the specialists of that

so
yeah and
the screen has to be square or it can be like a a shape quite uh with curves
it could
yeah
okay okay
yeah yeah it should remember banana but it's not doesn't have to b to be uh uh really the size and exactly the shape of a banana
so we are agree with the banana thing okay
so the last point we decided it's infra red i guess everybody's agreed
uh so that's it i think about the concepts you have other
thing to add to this point or uh no so
uh about the user interface so we are going to use l c d  in the last
meeting we talked about uh hidden buttons
i don't know what we are going to do with that you talked about the buttons on the side
mm what
yeah
okay and you mean the first layer would be spongy
so is it is it possible to do that it
would be a great idea but is it possible technically
like doing a spongy layer of the banana and you open it
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah but do you see that as a
rigid thing or like like a banana something very soft you can open like banana or
yeah
so i dunno what you think bob but it would be great for users i think and very good for marketing
yeah
yeah
um
and setting buttons
hidden in
mm other remarks or something or
something we didn't talk about yes yet or
i think
we are almost there uh maybe how can we if we have a soft thing
like this and to open it we have to attach it somewhere i dunno how to do that technically or
and how
yeah maybe
ma magnetic oh
okay
okay
and what would be the matter here of the first layer i mean
mm likes
soft plastic or
yeah yeah yeah
hmm
and something we forgot maybe uh about the speech recognition system are we going to use it or not
it i yeah it seems feasible and it would be something very great so we have the
de design the a good shape new and so on and we have also the technology thing w
will be and even the easy to use thing so it will be perfect so we add also
the speech recognition device
so that great we have decided everything and think we are on a good way
so um
uh the next meeting will start in thirty minutes
um so uh the the industrial manager
uh will uh will work on the look and feel design the user
interface uh uh mana uh manager will
work on the user interface device and the the marketing expert
will do the first project evaluation
so i hope you can do that in thirty minutes and uh yeah i
uh i think you should work together s you uh hamed and peter to work uh in a in a first prototype and uh
more about the shape and so on and how you can manage to put everything together
and um as usual you will receive some specific instructions on so
thank you all everybody and see you in thirty minutes
mm hmm
hmm
what does it mean spongy
like soft or something
okay i will see
okay

i think the biggest struggle will be the easy to use feature we'll see
exactly
uh okay so good news from me uh uh for me from hamed but bad news from bob obviously because spongy design i don't like it as okay so could you please fabien open it
i'm person two
and which one uh probably the first one i'm not sure but check the first one
i most of the things i have to write myself on the board but yeah that's it just
it's only this slide yeah this this is just uh one thing i wanted to mention
and show you that i just uh i just found this that our
company uh developed a s a seven f seven fingers or i'll just
yeah seven seven inch t  t f t  screen which is good news for us since we wanted to include a display
there uh so i i probably
draw it down raw scheme this is this is the stuff that i can use to
okay so the this will be like the overall scheme or overall requirements from
the engineering point of view
uh first thing is uh this will be the overall shape no uh
i'm not speaking about the real shape of the device but the shape of the inside of the device
so there will be some circuit uh for the power
so say power circuit here uh the main energy will be taken from batteries that we can
uh uh and if we decide to use the speech recognition stuff
there we must use additional source of energy which i found the best is to
use the solar cells which can which can uh supply everything i was computing all the all
the things related to the speech recognition and it's okay to use just uh two batteries and solar cells so so no problem
there can be also solar cell uh the main board with all the circuits will take at
least seven to seven centimetres so this is my like hard requirement
for the guys from the design so at least seven to seven
it depends where you put your screen because the screen is uh seven inch so it depends on you where
where you put it it doesn't matter um it's just one cord from from the main board to the screen which
can be elsewhere so this will be t f t 
and on the main board we have the um interface to the microphone
which is somewhere
say here interface to the microphone then the graphical card uh for the
t f t  and the third unit is the i r  the good news is that we can uh we
decided to use the infra red unit because our company has also developed
the chip for communication by the infra red including all the stuff inside so it will be very cheap for
us so infra red here so the once again the overall requirements
seven to seven centimetres for the board which has to be which can be spongy but has to be this size
and the t f t  which is seven inches um i have to check
what i wanted to
uh from my point of view i don't care about the about the material used for the overall des uh ov all the device

a all these things in in uh in this box are okay to put in in any shape basically
but we have to take care of the t f t  well sponginess maybe it a good feature since it takes if
it's around the t f t  then it's good because it's just
keeps it safe i dunno
well it's maybe related to the u i  a yeah that's all from me
yeah
well seven to seven inches
yes

yeah but
to be honest i was
yeah honestly speaking i was thinking that it was seven centimetres initially but it's seven inches but i i think we can we can cut it
yeah no no problem because because because then the size of the graphic card will be one fourth so
yeah but no problem to to me to cut the screen
so so for the same price we have four screens now
ah well this is like this is almost nothing seven to seven to at least well some three millimetres or something
yeah but we wanted the big buttons and stuff like that you know
because if it's t too small we can we can lose it at home you know
i thought that it it should fit in the hand or something

w i i think so i if the roller buttons are on the side you don't have to catch it like that but
just like this and you know follow follow well that's that's no task for me
but well seven to seven at least yeah but
oh okay okay thanks
not
j uh just a point to the energy th things if we use the batteries
and the additional so solar cell then it's okay for l  uh speech
recognition and l c d  so no problem in energy i think
but we have to use the solar cell otherwise not

yeah i was thinking just common a a  cells
so like three to five centimetres i dunno exactly but
s
uh d doesn't need to be sun it it's just the daylight you know
yeah well i i suppose that i suppose that uh that this remote control won't be in the in the room like this where there is light only when when there are people but
yeah from the t  i don't think it's enough uh
ah it's a it's a compromise no
yeah that's why i wanted to to include the speech recognition because you wanted all the new things

uh the s the screen is okay but the board uh that's the problem
well what what would you guess as a shape or what what would be the shape
mm
okay
okay
five to ten well that
yeah right yeah i think it's feasib well one
um um how could we do it we could put the board next to well under
the l c d  and for example make the l c d  be totally unrelated
to the thing that you hold in your hand like holding something and the l c d  to be just on
top of it you know somehow well but maybe let's stick to the s spongy thing like one
unit well fi five to ten it would be feasible
okay so five to ten i i think it's it's feasible i'll make it
fo five by ten
mm hmm
okay so
yeah so so just just give me the the the five by ten numbers that you find the best and send it me and i will work it out
hmm
seven to ten banana
okay rather mango or something or

you mean banana
well but
if it's if it if the banana is big enough
then yes
but if you want to look at the screen no well

well it can be whatever you want but if it's square then we get four screens out of one by cutting just but if you want some shape then we can only get like two screens out of seven to seven inches so
it's like more more expensive to have shape like that but i don't care you know if we fit this requirement
okay
yeah m maybe the banana could be like a bit uh fatter than than the c c common one but
like modified banana okay
well it we'll stick to banana or
okay
mm mm
yeah yeah
sure
like like peeling of the banana you s
it would be cool yeah peeling of the banana you know should should discover the other buttons which are hidden
first layer obviously spo yeah w it's it's like silly but the people will really appreciate it yeah i think
well is it possible to make it soft
so i think if it's so then it's cool
cool
honestly speaking i cannot imagine it so far but it will be terrible
mm

pof
well since since the since the things like the like the screen and um how to say that solar cell has to be has to be like kept
kept in the shape we cannot b uh so we need that the that the peeling
uh
i dunno but we should we should take care of these two two things so if if
uh the solar cell won't be visible while the banana is closed then the material must
be able to put the light inside you know so that we can reach the energy out
of it out of that
it is possible but well if it
i dunno i dunno how to how to do it if if t if to if it's better to put the solar cell
to the t to the peeling or outside it or or inside but
then it must be some window there you know
yeah
i agree
okay
okay
hello
i s
no no you you can start

yeah the second one could you please show the presentation number three
yeah
three

yes
just could you please check if it is the first one or the second
uh n n no it's the first one the second one
uh yeah
okay

okay so i am going to talk about a little bit about how this remote
control should be appear to be more easy to use i think uh i think the feature
easy to use is more important than being fancy but okay we can discuss about it uh later
um generally generally uh this remote control
uh uh should be should be something in my opinion uh the first feature
is just to be easy to use so the more frequent buttons should be larger they should be placed
in a good position uh uh inside the remote control and
uh s uh i can conclude like this that we shouldn't need to learn how to use it
it should be we shouldn't need to es open a a t book and uh start
reading and uh learning how to use this uh this uh remote
control
okay so what i found out that uh as i said uh
i think it's better to put uh more frequent uh uh uh ke uh buttons which are used more
in the middle of the remote control and they should be bigger in size uh
the shape of remote control should be in a way which can which should be taken easily in hand it should
not be completely like uh a cube it should be it should have round edge
so uh then it's easier and maybe uh just like some
toys some joystick which is easier to take inside the hand and uh also f
uh uh m because because customers doesn't like to buy lots of battery it should
not uh consume lots of energy
okay and my personal p uh preference is uh as i said uh
just putting this buttons in a special places and covered some buttons which are not
used uh that much like settings button like mobile phone usually some mobile phone
cover the dialling number part so we can cover these buttons which are not used or
uh number buttons for the for the for the can channels and just put uh
volume change or s ch can uh channel change buttons uh uh
in the remote control and if the user needed to do some more complex task uh
he he can open the cover and then change settings or something like this
uh and also uh i think if we put some some
some some some buttons inside of the remote control it can be used easier
not on remote control i dunno if i can explain well but uh just inside
for example a sliding or rolling uh uh d uh stuff if
we put it inside then we can easily manipulate with uh thumb so it can be another
uh preference and uh i dunno but uh i think usage of a speech
recogn uh r recogniser can be good i know that it consumes lots of energy
but if we do it in some way that it asleeps when there is no sound and when it detects
some sound it may consume less energy and i think it's good because
it's something new and usually young people like something new so it may not be very useful
but because it's new people may buy it
uh i personally think there should be a big difference between uh between something otherwise they prefer to buy something which is coming from a famous company or
okay that's mine
mm hmm
well maybe it can have two shells a hard shell inside and a spongy shell outside

yeah yes

mm
uh
yes


maybe this
so but

mm hmm
yeah
hmm

mm
i think i think their being uh large or small is not important the only important
thing is to be able to take it in uh inside hand easily so let's say an
average size okay and it should not be very heavy also and i prefer
to is it shouldn't have a uniform shape so in the middle it should be a little bit thinner
maybe maybe so we c it's like like some joysticks you can take uh
some some joystick you can take inside hand easier because it's it's designed for your f
uh taking into account your finger shape and your palm shape so the general shape
should be like this i think uh seven centimetre by seven centimetre is a
little bit large so uh seven not seven but
let's say five by ten it's i think it's that's my opinion
it's easier
yeah
mm hmm
mm
or uh or i don't know but i don't want to now invent something new because we didn't discuss about
it so using some l c d s we can touch so we can remove uh keys and just
uh having uh i dunno the name l c d  responding to fingers touching
the screen something like mm like tactile
so but for now if we don't want to use such kind of screens i i think we using a a smaller screen is better because

a smaller s
okay




i think this is not good
mm
mm


okay
yeah i think infra red
yeah peeling of the banana

yeah
mm
yeah
uh
mm hmm
yeah some
something like a plastic cover covering uh some interface u s b  interface as
in the in uh digital camera if you see it's like peeling you open a plastic
cover and you see some u s b  interfaces some some interfaces for adaptor
so keys can be uh buttons can be covered like this with a plastic cover and
uh when uh and when you open this cover it's like peeling a banana so something like this
yeah yeah yeah it's a lic like a plastic cover so


mm hmm
yes yeah it's a good idea
magnetic
mm yeah or a yeah it can is it can be a plastic cover uh sticking to the
to the all the stuff like uh with magnetic p uh magnetic uh magnetic
uh materials in the border so it's it sticks like
refrigerator door completely
and when you try to open it it will be opened easily so you you can be sure that it will not be open while you're uh while while uh you are commonly using uh buttons on the banana
mm
mm
mm
yes i think i think so
mm
mm hmm
mm
mm

thank you
hello
okay
okay i'll start can you open my presentation please
i'm number four
trend yep
can you pass the mouse please oh okay that's fine okay um so
basically i just want to presented to you present to you some recent results we've had from um looking at uh
um some remote control market research and some fashion trends around the world um
the fashion trends we got from talking to our our contacts in the fashion industry based in paris and milan
um so f from our market research basically we've come to the conclusion that
a fancy look and feel um as opposed to a functional look and feel is our number one priority
um fancy is is is is the you know highest priority secondly um
that our remote control needs to be techn technologically innovative um
so this is t number two priority but it's two times less important as the fancy criteria
um and third thirdly the easiness of use is is the um
is is important as well but again two times less important as the technologically innovativeness
of the remote control
from our f fashion people in paris and milan um we've discovered that this year
um fruit the fruit and vegetable motif will be the most important thing in in clothes shoes and
furniture so i'm pretty confident that our remote control fits
into the furniture category and also um the feel of material this year
um is expected to be spongy
um so hopefully our remote control reflects that s in some way
uh sort of um squishy um yeah soft like a
uh like a sponge i don't know yeah um so in conclusion we need a
our remote control needs to be something that's really fancy um has lots of technolog tech technology
in it um somehow would be good to have it related to fruit and vegetables with a spongy feel
and that it's easy to use and from our last meeting our you know fabian told us that w you know
one of the requirements is that we have to reflect the look and feel of our of th the real reaction company
um
that's it
less important so um fanciness first and then two ti you know half as important as that is technology technology and half important as technology is easy to use so


inch

so
so
ca
can i ask a question
this seven inch t f t  screen how big is it in reality
so like that
that's quite big
uh uh have we decided that we're gonna use this t f t  screen
but i mean even even that is like this big

yeah
you can cut the t f t  screen

okay so
okay
so what's the size of the device
even from my perspective seven t seven centimetres by seven centimetres is still
is it can you hold that or
yeah a small c control that they can hold in hand
but is something that's seven centimetres square e easy to hold
okay
so if we use s solar cells um where is the sun if someone's watching t v  inside

okay

okay

it's it's quite innovative yes
and if you watch t v  outside it's very useful
which is the same area
could you re could you redesign your board
oh five five centimetres by ten centimetres
yeah
mm touch screen
so


well it's it's definitely the obvious choice with the colour of our company i mean what other what other fruit and vegetables do you know of any any other fruit and vegetables that are yellow


well
i'd like a shaped screen i think that's more important than saving a bit of money on on the t f t  screen
yeah banana's good okay



i think if we if we have a spongy layer on the outside of the banana then it's easy to make that you know to manipulate that to hav be a cover that you can pull off and
i think for sure definitely the softer the better
yeah
we could use velcro
or uh ma maybe a magnetic
thing
yeah i imagine some sort of vinyl thing
in a in a sort of a with a suede sort of feel
maybe
mm so you're saying is it possible to have a solar cell and this removable cover and
and a and a banana
yeah
okay

i think it's important i think one of our p priorities is tech technology and
mm hmm
yeah
okay

okay thank you
so in last meeting we have discussed the conceptual design and we asked you to prepare a prototype for the
for the remote control so so let's see the what
did you prepare
sh share folder for th your presentation
because i have here
okay just one
why you why you you put it in the the side
it's not a good place maybe
oh it's very costly microphone array
how much does it cost this one
fifteen dollars
ah it's above it's above the budget
how many b battery is there
battery
so one one battery
it's kinetic reserve

mm
i think it's not a good idea because after maybe one or two months
of function is
getting destroyed if you


mm hmm
no four dollars it's good
and we will we will serve the charger with this
with the remote control
okay so the price of the charger included in the

mm hmm
the price should be below twelve and a half euro well that's so
we have we have just
the price of selling is twenty five euros
and the price of
production
that's for this basis function and if you want more you pay more

yeah
okay

but
mm hmm
titanium


what what's
maybe yeah what's the price to p to produce
with with with the charge
okay
we don't have charger

we don't have all the options
charger we don't have charger here either
no it's
it's below the the the budget
it's below the bu
the budget we

yeah
you
and you

mm hmm
uh
for l c d 
without l c d 
uh no innovative yeah



so let's remove it
but
this is the problem
no it's just if i i see the
the f the rate i think it's better to do it without l c d 
because that's with l c d  just will increase the price and i thi i they have the same rate so without l c d  it will be
mm hmm
mm hmm
without l c d 
yeah
what a what what about the sys speech recognition
what about the integration of speech recognition
ah so it's optional with the okay
i think it will be i think i
i think it will be better if we have all these modules in the same remote control because maybe parents will lose these uh
yeah or ma yeah or maybe parents they can for forget where they put it or so mayb better if you have all this in the same

yeah
so you mean that even if these modules will be will be functional uh will be optional
uh
i think it inc increase

i think it i increases

hmm
and and we we we we we we don't want that


so

project evaluation project satisfaction for example
i don't know we have to ask these question we have to give answers so
project evaluation


mm hmm
yeah i think so he gave you the liberty to talk as you wants
uh the teamwork was very very good i was really i am very satisfying to work with
with you oh
less fancy
de

without without l c d  without speech recognition it will be simple
yeah free free coffee
yeah thank you for your work and
okay
yeah so can you go out to the shared folder
mm the shared folder
yes
we have a presentation

uh

so i got the participant uh
three
w uh
three
it's the final design yeah

s so so i discussed with guillaume
right and uh so we have and we we are both agreed
on some two versions of the prototypes because we were no not decided whether we wanted to have
an l c d  or not because it's too expensive so we come up with two versions
one with and one without l c d s um but both comes with a charger
and then detachable and uh or control module
and detachable big buttons for all people um
so
mm
mm
mm hmm

no i i it's the all around camer uh microphone isn't it the the microphone picks up
the speeches from anywhere

yeah
mm
yeah yeah
for the
yeah
mm
hmm
is it n the two a a s batteries in it a a  rechargeable batteries
yeah rechargeable batteries we have the charger so it's no problem

actually uh it's a flexible thing you just n uh

yeah yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
mm
at uh yeah i forgot to tell you there is only a single button there b this button yeah
alright this button is like the mouse is like a joystick you can move in three hundred and sixty
degrees of direction so you can make a turn and it the additi functions associated to all
the actions you ma you have a click you have a double click
all in a single button you can move up down left right or you can do a swing
so a swing to the left a swing to the right defines other functions so even though it's
a single button but it is pretty s flexible because of the three hundred and sixty degree movement
yeah this is the version y that comes with l c d  here i present another version without the
l c d 
mm
uh okay this is new prototype uh
yeah yeah
mm


oh no th actually th we'll come to that point in our
yeah
w w i'll i'll come to that point later on
yeah
th they either these with the uh the the charger any in either versions you they they ha they use the same charger yeah
uh it's a standard module so you should get it for a cheap price uh
it's that same charger that you can use for the hand phone but uh again depends on the
types i think we have to investigate more on that but
yeah
yeah but as the marketing manager says people is willing to people are willing to pay more for good design

yeah
yeah
mm hmm

yeah we'll we'll come up to that the the the thing that makes this the controller cheap is that it is modular
so you want more function you pay more if you want less function i i if you want a reasonable price
you pay for the functions that you add on to the system so is uh modular
yeah yeah for example the l c d  you can take it you can put it put it back in or you can use the
other one or the speech recogniser with the microphone yeah yeah
you want a microphone to put in the speech recogniser you don't wan you pay less for the system
you see so
it's pretty flexible in the yeah price
uh yeah yeah you should present that

yeah
yeah
mm
hmm

yeah
yeah the i the idea the the conceptual idea is that
simplicity and powerful simplicity meaning that we have few buttons
powerful is that all the controls with the one you saw we saw earlier in
the meetings with lots of buttons n but here you only have few buttons but you retain the mm the
same powerful functionalities but in addition with simplicity
so that's the best idea the cond that that's our uh an innovation
um uh i in this uh design here okay now we come
to other important features that i did not tell you the first one is the speech recogniser again it's detachable
or add on and then we also have security feature for example this here oop
it's very robust it doesn't break and the material what's the material again titanium material
again uh and the battery life is uh is an is an endurable one again because this is a a 
batteries you can choose the types of battery you want lithium ion may be a good one but you can replace it with cheaper
one again you pay for what you get and then um y the other p points are robust and misplacement
reminder so when you finish watching your t v 
and you the you t you turn off the t v 
uh and then there's this message coming out that uh please put that back to the charger so so that's the or is it that's the reminder part yeah and um
and it also use a programmable channel and vocabulary so we didn't define the vocabulary so it's up to the user
to define so sorry
and then uh because of the chil because children are using the device so we have also a
a of t v  programmes by genre and this can be used by the adult or by the children
so instead of choosing the channel you are choosing the t v  contents of the night so
it's pretty powerful and that's that's why the num buttons are reduced because of this feature yeah
and and for the materials that is cheap to produce i think uh it's quite clear from
yeah and also like the and the fancy designs yeah maybe we can improve
more on the design but uh this is the
yeah

yeah
yeah
yeah

yeah


mm

mm
spongy spongy
mm mm
mm mm
but the the problem is that uh is it robust to mishandling
we have you should find a material that is robust at the same time spongy spongy

mm hmm
mm hmm
mm
mm
so so is the e evaluation depending on us or other users
yeah
but who will give the scoring uh we ourself or or a third party
mm
mm
mm
i think we can improve on the design som someone um commented this is like a the stone
age uh design um we have been focused all all this
time on the on the technical aspect functional aspect but also the simplicity
as for the design maybe we c should hire a designer to help yeah
yeah
yeah

mm


yeah from the innovation aspect i feel that uh what is most innovative
of our prototype compared to the existing prototypes that we saw l in the last meeting
is that um the retrieval of t v  programmes by content because
uh that is really innovative and for now and another innovation
we have is simplicity and simplicity few buttons we've uh
a lot of functionalities so that is uh that is uh for both th
our gi i think that the our our product is uh has the best in all well this is a biased judgement because we designed them
yeah
uh the innovation is v is very high i think
both
for both
it's the same innovation so maybe i can put six to seven
both
mm
uh uh uh there w there was a there was a issue here is that what are what is the display on the l c d 
we haven't really uh determined what are actually actually it's good to have a l c d  but what are we gonna display on a l c d 
yeah
yeah
yeah but
yes exactly
but you cannot display all on a l c d 
anyway for for the users who who who opt for l c d 
we'll give them the give them the l c d  we give what the customer uh wants right

yeah

yeah
yeah

yeah i think sorry

yeah

yeah yeah
yeah
mm s
yeah i have another thing to say about the easy to use aspect i think the easy to use
uh aspect is different for different people for the young generation easy to use may be very
complicated because uh they w they wants lot of controls with lots of buttons for kids they
want simply the s similarit for the old people they want simplicity so that's why we have
the parental module
uh we can ha have build a more complex design if if they want it but
but uh what i'm trying to say here is that the um we have different sets of buttons for different
kinds of people so in terms of easy to use i think it's very user customisable
user customisation is very important yeah yeah so
w uh
i think it's the same
yeah
yeah
mm
yeah
to improve on the design
huh
the speech recogniser is a add on module
right
yeah

oh
the problem is if i we are bla if a customer wants a certain component and doesn't want the parental
control because it's a couple who do not have children when you sell the product
in the market you could meet any kind of people and not all people will need all the functionalities we propose
to them so we might lose the customer because of this i don't know what do you think uh
yes exa what do you think i don't know you are marketing manag
yeah
yeah but the the question is n does those modularity increase
the production cost or decrease the production cost

mm

mm
yeah
well well the other aspect is that if in the when they have the ar existing product you you gonna maintain the the you're gonna keep the same customer because the same customer will come back to buy other add ons
so so
yeah i i so if don't don't buy now they can buy i in the future so in in that way you're actually keeping
the cus the same customer attracting them to come back in again and again
we're not trying to follow the microsoft and we don't want to the m
yeah well if the buyers can be up the th would be can be upgraded it would be a good thing right yeah it depends on the v production
mm
mm
yeah
what we can change is to propose the customers with skins for example the i the mobile phones nowaday they sell different kinds of skin and then people just feel that oh i have a new skin and looks better
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah you can pl in what material would that be in uh
yeah or furry like a pet dog kind of thing

i suppose that you this criteria is it
room for creativity this room is a bit small but but i think it's okay for us to work with
yeah mm
mm
yeah anyway we have the laboratory nearby to build our modules so it's okay
good job good job

thank you
alright
mm
mm we i i know something we need more cakes more biscuits on the table while we have meetings
mm
mm

alright then we finished
thank you very much




mm
yeah
s okay so i'll show you the the two prototypes here we have the first
one with the beautiful uh l c d  um display you you can s
here and you can uh just um browse into the the navigation menu by
uh joystick joystick like uh button you can uh choose the direction and
if you just push on it it's considered like a enter function
you have on the mm on the side here the microphone for the for the speech recognition system here and here the the switch that control if you want
well i i i think uh it's the
yeah but
yeah
well so it's a microphone array no it's
just a single microphone and you i i think uh we we put it here because
i think when you when you are browsing your l c d  you will be close to well it's better
to to to place it here th than here for instance and here is a little switch that control
if you want the the speaker uh recognition system to um to be on or off
and uh so this remote control comes up with its charger
well this this prototype is um made for about uh well fi fi fifteen fifteen dollars
fifteen dollars but uh well it's not it's not uh yeah but uh it's
just a prototype and if we uh if we optimises the um the uh voila
yeah the and the the production costs we we can achieve uh about ten dollars
how many excuse me
well uh f battery we use uh about uh
yeah
rechargeable of course because we have the charger
yeah and you just
on uh yeah one battery

the excuse me
oh yeah it's just a r uh simple battery a rechargeable uh if you uh like it's exist
yeah
so and if you want to charge the battery you just put the remote control like that to plug in the the charger and uh leave it uh alone it's alright then the next time you pick it oh
it works
yeah just explain the button uh norman


yep

yeah it's
so we have the the second version also with the different uh button configuration the second
version is also simpler we d uh we had just uh i have to put the microphone also
so basically th it's the same uh yeah basically it's the same uh things uh
uh as uh i presented before but here we have uh we have uh four buttons for navigation
press one button uh acting as a a enter button so um yeah according to
what you said it's more robust to the user
and uh it's also cheaper to produce we can produce uh such remote control for about uh four dollars
yeah it's it's it's embed in the uh speech recognition system
so
so norman will explain to you
yeah yeah of course mm

thank thank you and so mm hmm

alright please uh go on norman with the special features



you also have the the the two other modules for the parental control
that that you ca you can add up to the to your remote control
i i if you uh if you want to to have more more power on what you do
and uh which channel you want to choose and so on
h here is just the the the module for the kids and th if the parents want to watch t v 
up they come up with their modules they just plug in it and they can have all the control they want here
we also have this module for uh old people with big buttons
clearly labelled and it acts like the previous one you just plug in and it
works

the titanium and so it's very uh


well so the price to produce
for uh the simplest one say we start from four dollars to produce such a device
uh it's about it
the without without the charger it's about uh well two dollars to produce uh the microphone and speech recognition systems
two dollars for the uh for the add on modules and finally three dollars for the charger
so if you uh sum up uh everything
wi with the l c d  which costs two dollar you have two plus four plus four plus two plus two
it's about so the total cost if you if you want all the fuct functionalities will be about uh fifteen dollars
but it's just if you want all functionalities
excuse me
yeah
well i think that the technical in innovation is is in the product itself since we
haven't yet a remote who are allowing to to choose interactively with the t v 
screen uh uh with just four buttons
okay
a sponge
hmm

yeah
well it doesn't look much fancy i'll i'll say three or four
yeah it's it it

technical aspects
yeah a three
uh four i think it's it's uh more easy to make f fancy things when it's not complicated so
removing the l c d  um gives us a li more liberty to to have a fancy look
well it's it's the same for both so i will give a five six
well five also uh norman please
with lot of functionalities

mm for both it's the the same innovations
six let's go for six
yeah
talk about

yeah but you have the same programme on the t v  screen
if you have the l c d  but if n
yeah
yeah
well i think both are really easy to use because there are few button buttons and uh well t p the menu are clear well organised so
well with little knowing of the technology you can you can easily use the product so i will give a six for the easy to use
yeah it's cheaper to produce
and uh if the the well if we have less technology we have more liberty to uh for the shape and uh things like that so
yep
yeah
six
um six
yes as you say with better uh yeah
and to improve the the look
yes and to give us more liberty to have a fancy look so
so let's go back to our laboratory and
yeah

it's optional yeah since well according to this study uh people more likes more to have a spongy uh remote control than


yeah
well it's about the same because if
well you can if you had uh something li
oh no because if you if you add uh something well yeah maybe because it's three different pieces uh to to to build but
yeah yeah yeah it's i think it's cheaper if you if you already built the all the functionalities um on the same module but uh
yeah



yeah
well so
yeah yeah i think we are yeah but we are also the um
well the components will have to change because uh we have to deal with the shape and um but i
don't think it will uh increase the cost too much so
uh well but it's a bit complicated to if if if you need machines to different machines to um ah well
yeah yeah we can have the same global shape and then uh add on skins and with with this uh tex spongy texture uh things like that
sponge

okay
so we finished the prototype uh presentation if you have uh something else to say

that was good
yeah



fine yes uh
very democratic
thank you
alright
come up with new product
yeah and also more well uh more seriously i think it's
it's a good idea to have uh clear clear points whenever we do a meeting
uh prior to the meeting to have uh well a list with the points who will
be discussed or things like that but
i think it's alright we achieved uh project goal i think
it's w yes more or less
yeah but
alright
so
so uh coffee machine okay

is it an only a single mic or a microphone array
mm hmm
yeah
okay
the cost would be le reduced
is that two or one

now what is the whole day rating for that
whole day's rating
what type of battery
something like a two a  a  three size batteries mm hmm
and the l c d  is this one on the remote
yeah

uh huh and also the switch okay
mm hmm
and i think you forgot a point here to have an button to find the charger because that's a major that's a
okay and if you disable speech recognition system then
mm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm
okay
yeah people are willing to pay more but the company is not willing to invest more at the moment
or uh

something like customised yeah
mm hmm hmm hmm
hmm okay
and this is other one
mm hmm hmm hmm
mm hmm
yeah that's fine
okay
mm hmm hmm hmm

with the charger
i think we can use excel
yeah it's a nice input but we have an
other inputs from the l public demands i think we will just have a rough look and then we can make our statements and we can finalise the product based on this discu
i think we can just go to my presentation then
we can wind up
or we could uh come to some f uh final conclusions
so the marketing made an evaluation criteria and these were some of the findings and uh
in the market the people are not really interested with l c d  without l c d  with speech
recognition interface or without speech recognition interface but most of the people
what they are interested is first thing is they want to have an fancy look and feel it should
be very fancy with colourful and uh very handy to hold and the second
thing is it should be much more technologically innovative
of course in that we could put l c d  or recognition to be more technologically innovative and the third one is easy to use
okay and if we go to the next slide here you can find these are the latest fashion updates
and so this in paris and milan they have detected this trends
that the this year it's going to be an year of fruit and vegetable so people are really interested
to see if they have an remote in the shape of the fruit or a vegetable or whatever they like
so i think it should be much more customised to make a different uh shapes
and the second thing is and if the material they really do not want it to be very hard as in the case of
very pl plastic or titanium it should be somewhat spongy
um
yeah so uh so finally we have these three criterias one is fancy look second is
innovative and third is easy to use
so these are the f uh three criteria on which we are going to build our remote so
and we have an evaluation criteria for each one of these say that we have
a seven point scale
from one to seven and for each of the product you could just give me the scale according to this
so now you have with l c d  and without l c d  so on this scale if it is true
if it is if it has a fancy look you could just tell me one or if it is false it doesn't it looks uh it doesn't look much fancy then you could just tell me seven so
we can make our study on this and
no no we have you have designed two products now one is with l c d  and without l c d 
according to you no according to you designers how will feel does it uh with l c d  and without l c d 
okay let us make this l  and without l c d 
on on this scale the l c d  remote control how do you look how does it look d is it very fancy or doesn't look much fancy
and you both agree for that

so i take three on with l c d  so without l c d  how would you rate it
four
and in the sense of innovativeness with l c d 
five with l c d  and
so without l c d 
no no according to design aspect we want to know how would you feel the innovativeness
with l c d  and without l c d 
okay
no actually uh to make it with l c d  you make more efforts so i there is
high innovativeness included if you make it with l c d  y then when it is without l c d 
there is not much innovativeness so we can't go
i mean that what you are sayin that's what the design
no it's like this i mean on the l c d  according to what i understand from your model is you have a joystick here and you have l c d  you just press your joystick you get here a programme uh then
no on the t v  you don't it doesn't display on the t v  now
l c d  then uh there is no meaning in having it on the t v  or then again you have a channels volume and all the stuff and what a
i mean that depends upon your design so
i mean
so without l c d  you want to put it fi the same level of innovativeness
and which do you recommend e easy to use with l c d  or without l c d 
yeah
or we can just go back to the previous slide uh where we ha we have a few updates
so i mean in the product design you could just amend it to make some few changes according to fruit
and vegetable or a spongy touch without l c d  and without speech recognition even then our
product is going to be very good yeah
yeah that's right
yeah yeah that's right
so without l c d  i just take it five
or you want it to be six
s s oh i think it's better to have this without l c d 
as our programme manager s pro project manager says that without l c d  it is going to reduce the cost also and it's going to be much simpler to use
so
that's going to be an optional if somebody wants to buy it they can have it otherwise no
it's an optional
yeah
yeah but i mean if you have an add ons the kids may just uh hide the parental module and so that their parents can't use it
in the same set yeah and and individual buttons to make them work
i mean how to how to how to make a marketing survey that uh how many married couple or how many couples have a t v  or to the number or singles who have a television so based on that i think
but you can make it on a single p c  with three different options
on the same p c b  yeah yeah
yeah that's right i mean you could just provide with an optional
so it's something like a microsoft product update updates and we sell it we make updates and sell it
and uh what's the idea about uh the shape of the remote controls uh can they be made into a fruit and vegetable types
do you require different types of p c b s and
or uh it could be like this the p c b  would be the same for all but only the exterior uh shape is different o for all
yeah yeah that's right
yeah that's right
i think you need to look into the material
yeah yeah
i think the project manager would be interested to look about the financial issues in making these models

i feel it's fine we know we don't need uh i think it's okay
this is fine for making a presentat for project presentations
and the leadership was excellent
yeah that's right yeah that's right

and new ideas found any new ideas to make these presentations more interactive and more interesting
i mean uh what type of product would you think could we make this more interesting

yeah that is within the budget
and the evaluation was
yeah that's right
and the next is celebration
so
yeah thank you thank you very much
good
so well uh welcome everyone um as you may have noticed i uh
created separate folders because it was uh tending to get a little busy in our uh shared project
documents uh folder i don't know if everybody uh put their own uh documents in
the right folder which is for now the detailed design meeting
yeah
then i'll move this one
oh no this is just one big document so you can leave that wherever it is and we have a evaluation left here okay
well not main documents this time oh uh yes i have it open myself i guess um well the detailed design meeting huh
we're finally getting somewhere hopefully um what are we going to do i've opened it already um i'm still going to take some minutes and if i'm right you two are going to give a prototype presentation
aren't you yes you are and uh m did you do something with evaluation criteria good
and we have a correct agenda and uh then we have to look at something which is less nice
the finance uh aspect whether we can afford what we have designed and if we can we can
uh commence the final part which is the production or project evaluation how did we work
together and what are the results and how happy are we with those okay well finance uh will be later
now i'd like to give the word to you two
so a separate button for for text okay
mm hmm
thank you looks good
and i just missed when i was typing the r r  stands for
logo okay okay well
i would have recognised it if it were the right colours of course
okay the evaluation criteria huh
well it's looks fancy especially with the green colour and the the curves which we decided huh
only what happened to the single curve
we spoke about last meeting

well it might work one time huh
okay
okay but we have to rate uh these things now okay
mm hmm
yeah
well i think uh especially because of the microphone and the l c d  screen also
very new thing well
fancy the old people will
no it's a two little bit strange we have to judge that ourselves huh
well i'd say two on a scale
no okay well that's true
okay one two that doesn't matter that much so make it a one
yeah m
yeah and you use these buttons the most huh so
so which
so which number are we going to fill in
a two yeah two three and what do you think
okay so we have two two three
a two okay because we have to
it's the box below it huh
otherwise we have two results in one question
okay next question

okay you're very enthusiastic about your own design huh
as well for the for the older people
and would it be easy for them to use the speech recognition
because that might yeah okay well
m maybe that's the most user friendly and easy to use
yeah well maybe that would make it even more easy to use for them
i'd say three
okay so we have three three two two or
so what are we going to do okay a three i see uh
another question
no
yeah yeah but i think you should make it one scale with with one being good and seven being bad because otherwise we can't uh calculate anything from the results so
okay a one because we designed for that huh
yeah
yeah and i though w we had about single colours but you can also make uh a wood colour not just one single colour but a wood like thing can't you
whether it looks like wood it isn't w it isn't wood but
you can make a print on rubber can't you yeah so that's a one then huh
do you have many questions
oh okay well
yeah but we have we also we have to get to the money
what spongy
uh huh yeah
yeah so isn't hard to lose you
yeah but a har
a hard to lose is good so it should this question should be hard to lose it's difficult to lose it

a two
a two
okay
yeah it's okay that happens above also but maybe when you scroll away and back it will be normal but
yep oh it isn't well okay remember
there
well i think it's it's uh a lower number so better because w we designed it for young people especially didn't we
what do you think
questions
two
uh huh

dissatisfy younger people um
yeah but those are more fancy functions not not really many features or something
it has relatively few features with
yeah
ours had other features with
okay you think one what do you think
you three yeah i'd say three so two it is then or
yeah yep
yeah yeah maybe maybe two well m th but the logo is on on the front so a two yeah that's

oh well that's that's pretty good huh
that was your evaluation uh show okay so we don't have to calculate anything because of um these results okay good um let's see oh it isn't asked to save but it did already
and this
everything okay well the next part uh might be a little bit
difficult to do
in a group but i am willing to try it
because we are going to look at the finance and i have a nice excel sheet to do that
and um i'm not sure if i put it in the project folder look on that um and we're going to calculate the production costs and if they are uh under or at twelve euro fifty
we're good and if they're not we're going to uh re design but we have to do that uh very very quick i think yes um i don't know if i
put the excel sheet in the
n not in the
folder i think it's
i think it's still in my own documents folder
oh shit
so
okay well this is it um maybe i could ask one of you to uh fill it in so that i can also uh take minutes and uh maybe the other can uh use that thing to count uh numerous functions
well we have to count some things and we have to think about some things but you have to fill in this column huh no uh count uh number of functions because for every button you have to pay and there are different screen shots so or different different screens so
yeah but it's it's more about the energy source huh do you use a hand dynamo a battery kinetic or solar cells
we'll wait
yeah
i'll just fill it in
um rubber indeed
yeah i think that will be
our best bet
and what did you change you changed the uh scroll wheel and
oh but it's just one
point so maybe you should should uh
yeah you should you should drop the speech recognition
and then you can keep the curve
or can't you
or make it on a hand dynamo but i don't think that will work
yeah mm hmm
yeah but uh a wooden remote control only helps for uh old people we discussed yes
yeah but it's only a half but i think the only option is to drop the uh sample speaker
yeah but isn't it per remote that you pay
half
i think you pay half per remote so each remote with a special colour
i hope
so the battery we have um advanced chip on print
because of thing yeah well you can at least make it curved again
because that was very important huh
so it's curved it's still that so we we dropped the speech recognition together with the speaker
we dropped the scroll wheel
and the rest is the same huh
am i right yes
no but you c yeah
okay but this this new remote we can afford
hmm no i hadn't i just received it
they don't work so hard at the finance department
yeah and that's it
twelve euro fifty um and did you try to make a new design or what were you trying to do
it didn't work
hmm strange
oh you can arrange
hmm can't you then just say copy
new page
paste yes
select none
okay and now you can erase
well it should be possible
oh no
well you can draw over it with white uh pen oh
yeah
sorry well but that's also useful for the evaluation because i think uh we have a prototype now which we can afford and uh we only need to draw a little bit to get a good uh
design doodle and i think we should then move on to the production evaluation because of the time
let's see we can save this now
and move back to here

mm hmm
and then all green okay well thank you
oh no
hey but you can erase that
uh oh
right

and you can't erase this hmm strange okay well uh just leave it at this and
quickly save um and then we are going to the project or product evaluation
we just did our project evaluation um well i think i can sit for that since it's almost
my final slide um
what did you think about uh the process how satisfied are we
mm hmm
yeah
yeah
and you could ask things
and for me it sometimes was a surprise who was going to present what huh and uh
yeah
so you would say uh communicate during our individual uh work
yeah
mm hmm
well probably to simulate the whole working uh process huh th you can't have a meeting uh for several weeks
no
so you don't think the smartboard is is really useful or
yeah so it's maybe a bit unnatural also
that wasn't me uh so um the means we discussed the smart board and what about uh this digital pen
yeah well i use it as a a normal pen and and and only you use it to uh get it on the computer huh
yeah
yeah
okay um
and what about the teamwork
yeah well i think so too we
yeah but that was it was our assignment huh
okay and maybe i should walk out of the room when you discuss uh this point the leadership
yeah well okay
and creativity well when we look at this i'd say we have been creative huh but
there was room for
you did well i didn't have time for that
at some times i sometimes i received like like five emails at at one moment and then

i even got spam or something like that
and i was working and working and work
okay well um but after all we can say uh we are satisfied but it it could've been
uh better when we get uh when we have we would have gotten uh more information
yeah
yeah that was a bit mean to put it in the end and uh what were the other points to to improve this whole process
yeah they're pretty heavy
and so more time uh w might have improved the the quality of work is what you say okay
okay so more time during the individual work phases um okay well uh i
just got my warning for the last five minutes so i'll move on to i guess my last
slide yes which is the closing well uh we managed but we did it very quickly i don't know if that's the best way
to when it isn't is it when it is too expensive to quickly re arrange it and say okay this is it but we had to do it
huh because we have to have a design and that is within the budget and we evaluated maybe we should
re evaluate uh the product but we did that before and we also evaluated the project and
i think uh everybody's uh very happy at least i am with the results so uh celebration
well for the three of you because uh i have to write the final report now but uh well thank you very
much for your co operation and i had a very nice day so far okay
um
yeah i have t i think we also have to go to our own rooms again but um well i at least but maybe you can try uh to make a screen shot of this so i can try to include it in the final report
yeah maybe wants to but at least this one i know we should remove this but it won't h
okay and uh please put it in the project folder then huh
okay well i uh
i hereby officially close the meeting and uh i hope to see you uh soon
well i think we'll be a bit a bit longer but okay well happy celebration huh
how big uh
not too big whatever you think is good




what
yeah

yeah
we didn't make any uh
oh in
didn't we just do that
oh

hmm

we could
oops
yeah
well uh we made a prototype we first start with the overall uh
this is about the total remote control we made it green
yeah
it's a fresh colour and uh the screen light blue
oh uh this the scroll button and the microphone on the on the sides here under and the r  and r  logo it just says r  and r  now but uh
any questions so far
yeah
yeah
oh y you perhaps you should make it a bit big so people know it's there and uh
uh
hmm
you push the scroll button and it's claps out if there's a
remote settings et cetera
yeah
yeah and you could also touch it so that it comes out and and use the the the scroll thing as a with your fingers
yes
yeah
yeah perhaps we should use the teletext sign in p yeah
yeah
forgot
uh well this is the total interface uh that f of the l c d  screen uh the numbers
which is pretty straight forward we put ano an an extra button in we can erase it but it's the button where you can switch channels
just when you are one and you go to two you can or if you go to five you can go back to one
with that button yeah that one yeah it has a name and uh uh we put
that in i thought it would be handy there uh this the one number or two numbers button
below that the page and the sound and uh in the middle the the mute
uh battery indicator it's it's a bit big and this is the uh the on off uh knop the stand by uh knop
or at least it should look like it and the options uh of teletext
huh
yeah well this about it i think
yeah
i will put it back on the on the nice green
that's the logo of the yeah it's th th right now it's only r  r  but uh
yeah sorry
oh full screen yeah

right
yeah


yeah

yeah
well
yeah
it uh oh it's in the background oh
y you should make uh a sideways uh view
it will be i guess oh we can
oh g i would smart board uh can i draw here or uh
ooh
so it would be uh something like this from the side but with a bit of uh curve here right
yeah
so if you v flip it like this
here's yeah
yeah so you just make the back of this part a bit bigger so that it lays a bit o
yeah that's a bit of problem maybe
yeah
i think yeah the battery should be in here because it's just nothing so if you could
yeah 'cause otherwise i think i
i think it does i if you don't make it green then the elder people won't won't like it
yeah
i think it does
yeah i don't know whether older people will use it but
i would make it a two or something
yeah
huh
alright it's a one oh it's a one
yeah
but it's a one uh maybe uh
yeah
well they think it's very true but uh

yeah but
we should perhaps
that not
yeah

i think it is because it has an l c d  screen a mi microphone
it's from rubber yeah
it's a one i think
yeah because they're right on your screen
so you can use the b the the arrows
they're right on your screen so i don't know where you'd search yeah
well i think they are
the options are it uh little bit harder but if you touch the options then it's uh
no they're not but they're they're they are easy to find
oh
yeah
i would say yeah
yeah
yeah you can make it a two
yeah but you don't have t have to use the button on the right you can touch it yeah
you you can touch options
yeah
you can touch options and it's comes out
the uh the um below


it's different
for young people i think it's easy to use
yeah
i think it's
in the entire mankind
yeah
yeah but uh
yeah but they they don't want the uh extra options right so
yeah okay but so they could
uh i think it is if they read a manual
yeah alright
because it it's not it's not it's it's not uh difficult you say you say uh record to to the to the speech recognition then you say the question and the answer and that's everything it does the speech recognition
yeah
i think it would make it uh
i would make it two
yeah
three
oh you
oh well
two and a half three no
no
but um i mean that's definitely one
oh nee oh seven is it it is yeah uh the remote score
it's not overwhelmed
yeah
yep
yes
'cause we make them in different colours so that they uh
yeah that it that it looks like wood like something yeah uh i think you can
it it feels like rubber but
well but then when you scratch it it does come off
so that's a bit
oh we have time

what
yeah yeah it's very spongy oh but not it's not very spongy because it's hard rubber
i think it's a three
hard but
yeah you can break it yeah
y yeah you could you could call it
yeah y you can lose it but it isn't hard to lose
two that it's hard to lose yeah it it is there's the it's a six you think
so it's a two yeah you can lose it so i don't you can make it a three i
it does have an a built in function
nee
hard to lose oh right
it is hard to lose yeah so then this is it is almost true so a two
ooh
oh
oh well it doesn't
i think it will yeah
uh well i a a two
it's it's much more younger
yeah i think it's a two but
two two two let's make everything a two
younger people it has
what did
yeah well that it doesn't
yeah bu but
i think they like the speech
you could call to your uh yeah and the screen yeah
right that that that those are features
no aren't the features the microphone's feature and that you can change the channel's feature and that you can change the volume is feature and that you can change the options of the remote uh uh something like that yeah
those are features

enough features
yeah
i think two or three
yeah yeah uh a two a two just another two we like two
yeah there's r  and r  in front uh it's not the colour so maybe you should make two but it has r  and r 
yeah
yeah but not r  and r  yellow i think
one d on i it's the colours and the
i think it is but i don't know what you think

and you can navigate easier because wi with the you have to push the the the arrows and with a normal t v  uh remote
yeah let's make a different remote well
menu
a two we only have twos
uh just twos one three and a few ones
two threes
we m mostly have twos so it's pretty good
yeah
yeah i think so too
we can be happy
yeah what is it it's like a bug or something a fly yeah
a f butterfly
yeah
that's it
sure
it's good yeah
yeah
redesign no
yeah
yeah
so we're going to erase features or something
do you have the cost or uh
let's hope we're going to be here at eight o'clock
we're goin still going to be here at eight o'clock
i doubt it perhaps we've got features that don't exist in the excel sheet
no it was in my uh my information so uh
yeah
well if it doesn't work
i want to fill it in but uh
but you should uh direct
the number of
we've got a battery one or t two batteries or not nee one battery with two small batteries
yeah i would do a battery we do right a battery one battery right
electronics simple chip advanced chip right
yeah so this one and this one
uh we ha we have um single what are we oh yay
the single
oh the the it's not going to work uh people we have rubber
thirteen
with a scroll wheel right is he integrated no eh
i don't know
oh yeah right we want it to it's not it's not no yep fifteen oh too bad
oh but with special colour we have a special form right
oh we don't have any buttons so yeah we need to uh
no uh we have fifteen and oh right
we could lose the curve
yeah i would lose the curve
but you can't push it so you have to tap
yeah alright so normal scroll wheel
and i think we should lose the curve
yeah but if you would i it is a new feature it it's something special
no the curve doesn't really
no then it will won't uh stand up from the table then it would just
yeah
so
we would lose this one
yeah we could s yeah a bit
sixteen point three
so we still
could could we do it on a regular chip on print or something
no ma y you just can't do that or uh
we changed th
yeah and the single curved to uncurved
no
yeah but it's t
yeah but it is uh it it is a new feature it is something special
i don't know yeah that's difficult
yeah
uh
we could make it titanium instead of rubber
oh oh can i ask something what is special colour
is that the wood uh wood uh this we have to have that one too
th then we still have too much
if we use the uh
yeah we we scrap that one
see a po three we need point three
uh it's a colour don't make it wood
make it uh
yeah but it's it's special colour is it
a all kind of colours it's also green or uh
yeah but it's a special colour than just rubber colour you have to add something to the rubber to make it green you don't say here's green rubber
yeah you can you should you have to lose
no it is the scroll wheel i guess
a push yeah
switch colours
it was such a great idea
what do you mean
oh but i think when you use the colour that's not originally the rubber then you use special colour 'cause you have to add it
yeah so you always lose the special colour you co you could make it always black like normal remote
oh right yeah yeah we should u yeah we have to make this like four or five or something that's what it means
yeah
oh right yeah is it per remote yeah
yeah that's right and you one colour per remote so then it is one
no
one
so it would be curved single curve
or not
so y you just can't make a nice remote
it's too bad for the speaker
should we change that tha that that's a one if not or not could you copy it and make it uh
the entire uh
perhaps you can then copy page or so
ooh
no oh you you made the entire could you

oh not well
would you
by the perhaps you can save this one and then copy or something add it copy page
select all
alright something went wrong
it doesn't work let's forget
yeah oh ignore that
well so
too bad
yeah the microphone
yeah a and we changed something i guess or not we
oh no
yeah i tried to copy that one but it didn't work
so we could fix it like tha that it's like this
you could select it all but then you can't erase
erase when you saw th li uh earlier when we selected it w i couldn't erase anything
just tap somewhere
yeah
i don't think i can but uh we can try
oh yeah no ha ha
yeah we tried it earlier it's very much work

yeah goodbye mic

oh i already erased half of the line
too bad oh

like this
still looks nice
oh that's erase
yeah that's a bit weird oh now i'm line
yeah
no it's weird
yeah bu but stressful you think no my presentation isn't ready
yeah
yeah you had information i didn't have and then uh
oh right
yeah
yeah
no
yeah you could
yeah
i think so too
yeah but then you can work together too when
a chat would also be uh
well i i don't really like the board it doesn't really work great sometimes i think
it does work but sometimes it doesn't erase or it doesn't uh
yeah
yeah
but
well it is useful but it doesn't really work all the time th the pen doesn't
the line is a bit off
yeah you can point to where you want the line to be
but
yeah

yeah
i

i i used it it it was you can use it it's quite handy i think
yeah i used it to y to yeah it did work pretty well
i don't think why you would want to use it actually but it it does work
yeah and then you can show it to everybody
it doesn't really write normally it's a bit
yeah
i think it was great yeah
yeah but it was because we didn't uh yeah

i thought it was good but uh yeah yeah
yeah

well
yeah
and you get get stuff from the from the computer but
yeah
you just sit there for ten minutes yeah where is that email

oh did you is it on there is it on there i didn't find the didn't look but uh i didn't look but
i got like one email after ten minutes or something

that's what we said
and it not a lot uh
no the first one i didn't know uh
nee
and i didn't know what to do for the first ten minutes before we got here so i went right yeah just looking at the screen and uh
yeah an
yeah that will be handy
yeah
yea uh so tha actually you could make an l c d  screen but no mic or it could make mic but no l c d  screen when you look at that yeah
uh i dunno
think that's about it
hmm heavier um less heavy laptops yeah
but that's not really uh
yeah
yeah everything worked
yeah but it's just the the off hours between that you will work alone
then it pops up pop up screen came five minutes in the meeting no
huh
you did well
oh right well

yeah
champagne
yeah
do we get another email
i i think we have to fill in a questionnaire again but
we do
yeah
uh th that that one
you can just yeah but it's it isn't a picture or well is it
no isn't possible but you can make a screen shot i think


yeah
uh oh export

images
how big do you want the images
yeah
this one
this one

um
well it isn't on the desktop
you can only save it in my documents
oh
oh alright
yeah
yeah
yeah
three
can we stay here

yeah
yeah alright
why can't we stay here
yeah



beep

oh

uh we should save that one
yeah save in the folder save as project
oh okay
hmm hmm
agenda

oh sorry

okay
get up stand up just 'kay
view
just example colour so uh there's one of the colours we would like to uh see in our prototype
okay
yeah just uh just an idea about how to m th that could also be possible
uh well it's an idea in a so
do not forget it
to function it it doesn't really have to be sm uh big of course the microphone could be just a minor uh hole uh on the left uh button okay um

we also made some uh ideas about how uh the options menu would work uh using the scroll button on sides uh y uh i uh um
yeah you push the scroll button
and a drop down menu or a pull out menu comes out and uh you get uh you get the options uh becoming
available for example uh t v  settings uh remote settings et cetera so
uh you can scroll down too with the scroll uh button uh as you can see oh it's here just push it
in uh the menu comes out like this and uh i it all becomes visible
um
yeah that's c yeah
indeed
okay um it's also uh nice to see that um we made a small uh menu uh
the options menu uh becoming available when pressing the uh scroll uh button and the opportunity to use the
teletext whi which is used uh which should still be used and we think that it's uh very handy to
put it uh not uh under the options menu but in uh yes
in an apart uh
in a separate button yeah
a sign yeah just like okay indeed okay we can uh modify that later okay would you like to make any comments about next uh
previous page yeah indeed
oh my god
it's quite large
okay you can see very clearly now that the uh teletext and options menu isn't uh
taking uh much uh uh it's taking much part of the screen so it's very uh
when you uh when you use it doesn't uh become irritating to see 'cause if you put it on the top you always
get see the the options menu
'cause people regularly uh read from left top to right down so
okay huh


full screen
alright
huh
my name my job
sorry you used the powerpoint
what bling
now uh the single curved idea was uh
yeah okay you ge um
yeah the sideways view uh that that that ma
ho not that pen not that pen

suppose so
ah oh my god it works
yeah that's the single curve indeed
yep
that's not very i it's also uh very handy if you make a side curve way to make the the remote control
very thin at the bottom uh at a bottom at a bottom uh make it uh rather thick on the top because uh
on the top it has uh the screen which takes uh in some uh space and the batteries can be located over there
so uh
yeah

no
yeah
okay indeed yeah
i think so it's pretty fancy
you get th
yeah

it's true it's a one very fancy

it's very true because we designed it to be very fancy so
it's very fancy i think have you ever seen a remote control like this
no okay so so it's fancy
yeah
and uh uh the scroll is rubber so s
eno enough to i think


huh
with the ones

yeah
take a harder look yeah sure
it's easier than the regular uh remote control
yeah
yeah they are a lot easier to find than uh th than on the regular remote controls where you have to uh
find out what which sign or icon means on uh every button so you have t you have to use the
the the manual to understand most yeah
i think it's uh it's a two at least
it's not perfect but
a three and why is that
it said bo both the options
yeah
a two a two
uh the next question the next question oh my god

yeah i was uh yeah
i think it's the most useful uh remote control ever to be manufactured yeah but because it has the regular uh controls li uh as you can see in the screen now and uh
you don't have all the other options uh always uh on your screen so it's t i think it's really easy to use you want these options to
uh sure
perhaps that is one of the most uh
uh because a lot of
channel one channel four yeah

yeah i think it does because all the people who can't uh
uh a two sure two oh
two
give me more
no
that's definitely our uh
a false yeah
yeah indeed
yeah is optional
huh
yeah
yeah it is it is harder to
to like
geez
we're getting paid we're getting paid
uh
yeah it's a three because you want to make it uh rather flexible but not too flexible because it has a l c d  screen
hard to lose yeah it sh and it's easy to find
isn't hard to lose
isn't hard to lose yeah
yeah this this is hard to lose
this
two yeah
and most all because of the option to whoa
uh
put the cor cursor on the
click
true
true
uh yeah uh
materials yeah
uh okay so ma uh make it make it a two
a two i think it's two i think it's two too two too too
well perhaps not
well n not exactly but uh uh if it had some games on it or something like that but it's for a remote control i think it i it would satisfy those needs yeah the speech possibility the colours
scroll options yeah
yeah
the easy volume up button
remote younger people usually use the remote control to put on the volume turn uh turn up the volume
two
one two three
right
uh
okay true yeah
i think it's easier to use than a regular remote control because when you push on the options menu you get the the the various options uh entirely explained entirely explained
instead of uh just finding out what an icon means on a button
yeah you can navigate
uh
you're not satisfied okay let's start over again then


a two
oh yeah i think so yeah
and three
the average
yeah i think so
save
it's a fly
oh m
yeah exactly




yeah it i it wasn't too much
as well as the l c d  screen whoa
count it you got excel to count
oh okay well i dra uh danny danny i'll do that because i draw the uh
no no solar cell no no no no
no hand dynamo hand
on advanced chip
yeah yeah
single nee single curved double curved was uh uh see uh ju three dimensional but it isn't three dimensional it isn't curved in a l
no no no single curved is like this uh that's the only curve you made not th uh curved like that that's uh
huh
yeah
yeah we gotta integrate scroll wheel and push button because when you push it and you w it won't just pu uh makes possible to s
not going to work okay
okay um
but now button supplements we don't got the button supplements
damn
okay

nah
we could lose the scroll wheel you could make it just a regular scroll wheel
yeah if you can't push it you have to tap the the options window uh button here and then uh scroll down with the d with uh with uh the button
normal scroll wheel
lose
okay so we don't exactly need the single we don't need a curve 's possible to lose curve
okay yeah that's meant with scr uh with s curve the curve is uh in a dimension if you make it a flat one s n it's no curve you got no curves yeah okay
no two
oh okay indeed
is it possible to make
no
the sample speaker is two d wait f s four points
yeah uh becau uh when you lose the

yeah

no that's no make it w uh when you made it uh uh uh a remote control of wood
you don't make a remote control of ah
it isn't
what
to knock the sample speaker yeah and sample sensor
but m yeah course but what we'll have let's make it thirteen or fourteen
a colour
yeah special colours fruity colours
yeah
yeah
they don't sell green rubber plants alright
no no no
if we lose the scroll wheel and make it totally uh depending uh dependent on uh the touch screen
then it's possible to make and then you can and then you can add to the colours
special c okay if you lose uh if you lose the
you lose this one you got eleven point five and you make i and then you can make uh the spec single curve for example
how d uh uh how many colours special colours all the colours you want because you want to make p
yeah but uh when you use more than one colour it's a special colour
i suppose
yeah
nee we we also want to make ano another colour
yeah indeed yeah you don't need four of those uh four of those special colours in one in one remote

hmm
yeah single curve
uh huh
okay
undo undo undo
so 'kay twenty minutes
okay so you had this list at start alright when did you receive this list ah okay
ah okay i suppose this is a
okay so we lose the scroll wheel the s
and the microphone
okay
strange
you can only re erase oh
uh no
bling
ah
just up somewhere b uh besides it right
uh we already try
all i need is no mic

bon chance

no add
yeah
s difference between lines and text and the pen

huh looks fucking boring now
deadlines were sometimes very short
but and stressful
yeah
yeah

yeah but but why not work here together for example why should we be separated from each other in those difference uh different rooms
yeah
huh oh right
but the technology was uh fantastic
work now
perhaps it is e
yeah perhaps it is easier to get one of those uh dig digital pens or so and to uh and lay it next to that keyboard over there so you can draw uh see it over th on the screen yeah
it's useful but not m
because when you put this pen on the screen uh uh for exam and line is d being drawn at at two or three centimetres uh below
alright
the project uh because of the deadlines you didn't had the time to uh have you didn't have time to uh to make a very uh
qualitati qualitative uh presentation
so you used uh this
uh the different powerpoint presentations uh in which you put your uh material in the
oh
wasn't me
but i didn't i uh
i used it too but oh well
yeah
yeah because it shou
to make some designs it is very easy
yeah
but to write it th yeah
yeah it's too big it's too fat

yeah
right
yeah
not too much not too too too too

yeah or the room for it was the idea to be creative so
you got some standard ideas in your head and this what came out
yeah
the information uh was sometimes uh a little bit too late or
yeah

was searching and searching


no w i didn't know
make a r yeah
yeah
no stepping on the table and then looking at the internet page
no
yeah more information about the costs
first of all i didn't think uh that we were able to make an l c d  screen uh first point but uh it was possible uh uh yeah
yeah
uh faster laptop
uh they were they were just fine
uh
right
yeah
mm
yeah sure
oh thank you
bling you're fired
mm
you cannot you can save it
you s uh file save as the j  peg j  peg
no
no
okay
in about five minutes
ah
oh thank you whoo hoo let's let's have party let's have some fun huh

no that uh is one thousand twenty four
yeah
if it browse
desktop
mm
i do not know
oh
yeah
okay


okay
alright
oh
oh
that's new one

yep yep
big microphone
oh okay
that's the place where it's going to be not the size
mm hmm
yeah okay of course
mm mm th yeah
small


shit
'kay

evaluation
'kay my task was this time to put up a questionnaire
by which we can evaluate the design of the remote control by the questions we requirements from the of the users my name my job okay the methods
questionnaire with seven point scale from one to seven from true to false like question is remote big enough we can say it's true or it's false by steps
one means absolutely not true seven means true
the three important things of refa are uh from th of this year is are is the remote control fancy enough
is it in innovative enough and is it easy enough to use
and then evaluation itself
uh
so
okay first question is the design fancy enough
project manager what do you think
but does it
yeah
think
yeah yeah you can
isn't going to be a little bit heavy at the top

with two batteries the whole print plate and t and top and if you're holding it quite a lot i think
yeah
yeah we have to rate is it fancy enough true is one false is seven
so fancy enough means does it comes to the younger people and the elder people
i think
yeah i have to agree all the colour colours don don doesn't matter that m that much now it's only design
and the design
so
a two
yeah i n used i wouldn i should use that one but it doesn't
okay no it's two true is a one very true is it very true or isn't that true
yeah i think two
that's fancy enough
then
okay let's give it a two is it innovative
enough
we have for the search function
the scroller a bit i think it's it's a one yeah
true
also huh uh huh the buttons are they easy to find that was a big requirement of the old people
are all the buttons easy to find not only this buttons all the buttons
i think th it's
easy t
yeah i think this is easy now i think th i think the options buttons are not the the easiest way to to
to handle
true
i would rate it a
yeah okay that's true that's true
but that's that's vantage of l c d  screen you can have text
yeah
i think it's a three
i personally think because i d i don't think i maybe it's easy to use it has to be easy to find right away i i think if you have the button at the right i don't think you can find the option button that easy
you can touch it
yeah okay but you have y then you have here s written option on here the teletext button right okay then okay good then i think also two yeah
yep

it's easy to use as well for younger as elderl elderly people
young means sixteen to forty years and elderly from forty eight to their death
also if you're sixty years old
also
yeah as well as your if you're fif sixty years old you're holding one of those things in your hand
no but we're going to th make this f for a all kind of people so it it it has to be
if you read the manual always
so
also two not a seven for this
i would also say three

remotes overwhelmed with buttons
no that that's that's yeah tha that's a one i think that's definitely a one
no oh yeah
yeah i think isn't this has to be something like isn't overwhelmed
true
remote control has uh colours that different that meet different target groups
yeah
that's true
also with rubber
yeah okay
yeah
that's a one okay
uh i have

the material used is spongy that that's uh that's a one that's m rubber
yeah i th think it's not the most spongy thing
yeah
remote control is hard to lose
y you can't you can't lose it if you're sixty years old if first time see the thing you didn didn't adjust uh set the microphone and then you lose it then you have lost it
it isn't hard no i think i think this is a two personally
no
isn't hard to lose
yeah
you can't lose it
or if you're you're sixty years old your demands
i think yeah i think also
huh
yeah oh okay
no
okay okay okay remote control mainly be sold to younger people
yeah true
very true
no i don't think very true because the colours
we have the colours um we have the buttons is aren't that that much
nah the material isn't that
so i don i think i think it's a three
yeah but i uh
okay okay i think because yeah
in the features
because younger peoples are cr critical and they wanted a lot of features on this thing
l c d  screen and scroll
i i think they'll be quite met with their expectations
no
it's three features basically the l c d  touch screen is feature
the microphone is a feature
yeah okay
i think yeah and then you have the audio settings channel setting video settings
yeah yeah so i've chos i shou i think it's it's it's a one
personally yeah i think once you've 'cause you have the channel features b uh you have the uh screen features audio features the you have all buttons on it which you'd like microphone extra l c d  screen extra scroll
thing extra
make it make it a two
or make it uh a fucking two you can see the remote control is r  and r 

has oh yeah do did have nah y you have the black one and we'll probably make also a yellow one
maybe two
x  marks spot and the menu is avail that is available is easy to use
yeah tha that's so true
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah uh
i think that wou that would be quite hard to learn to use
it no i'm not not convinc let's go th for inhalation of
air  i think it would be a t yeah two now lower
so okay we have one three a one that that have to got up
two two two two two so two yeah the average is a two that is quite good
in my opinion
that
ooh
ooh
top
okay
yes
no it's two the average is two
yeah i uh uh i uh saved it



f fifty five euros
no
yeah mm yeah maybe
the microphone yeah maybe you're going scrap scrap it
no prob
ah
count it li like write it be

ah okay cool huh yeah oh yea yeah you design it um

yeah
solar cell no it took a battery
yeah
we have
no we have sample speaker but b al but we also have sample speaker do
oh we already on nine
we have double curved
single
this one is
this one is curved like this right it's curved like this
yeah bu what
oh but we have curves like it and it there are two curves right oh okay i understand i understand rubber
push button no we don't have push button
l c d  display
eighteen and a half damn we have to lower it with six points
twelve and half
we could use
i think we should scrap the sample speaker it's four pri it four units
but w d wha
curved then it will be square
was that does that mean to it single curve
okay
yeah but tha that that only is one
no one
so we don't yeah we also have to
no otherwise we don't have an l c d  screen
single curved flat
yeah so that does doesn't doesn't that mu i think
scrap sample speaker that that's uh
yes four points
yeah but what what else what else uh do you want to scrap f you have to we have to scrap four points
ma make it with wood instead of rubber
yeah it it i yeah it also uh it also takes one point less
yeah
i think it is
yeah
yeah sample speaker
yeah okay three point three
huh
point twelve
that's a scroll wheel
yeah but a wood we can make it brown dark brown not wood
is it also no that that's just normal colour fruit colours normal colours yellow
yeah but then i d i don't think we can ever make to a twelve and half
but then we have to scrap l c d  display we have to scrap uh
s advanced chip
no then we have to scrap everything we got because how many colours we gonna make five then we have two
s touch
then we can make add two colours on it yeah two colours it
they can add two colours
but the colours um how ma uh the colours like l she told
is that all the colours we add or
yeah but we we we are we have yellow red uh black titanium
ah okay
yeah but the rubbers alls original black
yeah b
yeah but we're gonna make it yellow uh red and then you add you have two special colours on top of the one we have now
yeah but m
yeah because we have more colours than only black
i then i think i p i don i don't think they me mean they're special
yeah okay okay true
true true
we have two points spare nee one point
mm yep
y yea the scroll wheel is dropped
yep
tap
it should've work
yep
just tap somewhere
no
evaluation drops
and erase the mic


looks like a ipod
oh all i need is mic


station page
i think we it should be b it would be better if we worked a little bit together now we worked
through each other something he said yeah and you had information i also had so
some some things i had in my presentation they already told so
so yeah that i don't think that is the best way to work at for such project

yeah no or maybe session of five minutes together or something and then work separate
yeah
yeah
yeah m yeah like she told then you can work together too by mail or by i dunno chat something but now we're completely separated from each other i don't think that was the best way but
yeah the technology's okay
yeah okay but i don i do i think becau that's because
yeah
yeah like the f like a plotters or something yeah yep yep yep yep yep
yeah it is useful but
no
yep
i didn't use it at all
i didn't use
no yeah
it is it is yeah it is easy for to design something and then load it in your computer
yeah
yeah it's b bi little bit too big to write
yeah fat document those
team work was okay
only thing that we worked through past each other with some things that was only problem but
yeah yeah yeah but furthermore better
that's yeah no prob ah
yeah
okay
mm hmm
little bit uh lo yeah too late it it it took a lot of time before you got your ema yeah
i played i think seven times solitaire something
wha
oh right it is there
no i i never got that i always
n yeah


so does this i think lik oh and information was a bit low i think sometimes in in in in the beginning i didn't understand what what to do
yeah like i with with the remote and i never new we have t we had to uh yeah made a made a rec a remote control
yeah so
so yeah
yeah
mm hmm faster
yeah
yeah it only costs four units uh yeah

um
yeah nothing
i think we got it already
yeah
and furthermore the the the network was okay everything you loaded was also
av available there
so
yeah yeah but that
it's now half past four half past three so
yeah okay yeah okay
mm hm mm
yeah


yeah


no prob
mm hmm
i think you do
can you find it as a j  peg
no

in uh
celebra or shouldn't i
six hundred no i yeah
i think eight hundred six hundred is better
yeah
nah name


hey


oh my god
ten
yeah
ten
uh
celebration time come on
peace out nigger
entree


mm
you said uh targ target groups what does that mean
uh okay 'kay
so are
okay
alright
i can go first yeah


right um so f from the
right sure
uh okay
so n uh with uh with regard to the uh working design of
this uh uh remote control uh i've identified um a few basic
uh components of the remote and uh se uh from the
design functional design perspective um w i c we can now uh know wha what
exactly the components are and how how they work together with each other

so
this is the method that uh i'll mostly be following in my um in my uh role
um the identification of the components uh and uh since
since i'm dealing only with the technical aspects i would need feedback from the marketing person uh
and uh from the user interface person uh we'll then integrate this into the
product design at a technical level and uh basically update and come up with a new design so it's
a cyclical process
okay so these were the basic findings from today
the last three bullets have been integrated from uh the last minute uh email uh i just
quickly jotted them down um so basically uh the
as i told you the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it
uh and what are the different processes um and how the parts uh communicate with each other
um okay so e the mee email said that teletext is now outdated so
we need to do away with that functionality of the remote control um also
uh the remote control should be used only for television because incorporating other features um
makes it more comp complex
and the reason why teletext is outdated because uh of internet and uh the availability of internet over
television how however our our remote control would only be dealing uh with the the use
for television in order to keep things simple um also the management wants
that um our design should be unique uh it so it should incorporate
um colour and the slogan uh that our company um
has it as its standard
okay so he he here is a functional overview of the remote control um there's
basically an energy source at the heart uh which feeds into the chip and the user interface
the user interf interface communicates with the chip so i'll basic go over to the
okay
so if uh if this is our energy source and this is a cell uh it communicates uh it feeds energy into the
into the chip which basically finds out h uh how how to do everything there is a user interface here
so whe when the user presses a button it feeds into the chip and the chip then generates a response
and takes the response to an infrared terminal um which
then so the output of the chip is an infrared bit code
which is then communicated to the remote site which h has an infrared receiver
um the there can be uh a bulb here or something to indicate
whether the remote is on or communicating um so these
are the essent so a all the functionality of the remote control whatever new functions that we need to do
um make the chip more complicated uh and bigger basically
okay
um so i in my personal preferences um
i'm hoping that we can ke keep the design as simple and clear as possible this would uh help us uh
to upgrade our technology at a future point of time and uh also if we
can incorporate uh the latest features in our chip design so that our um
uh remote control does not become outdated soon and it's compatible with mot most uh televisions
that's about it so anything that you would like to know or
no i don't have any idea about what each component costs um yeah
anything else
yeah
certainly yeah so so tha yeah we definitely need to operate within our constraints but um unfortunately i i do not have any data so uh i just identified the functional components for that
yeah okay
yeah
mm 'kay
i it'll take some time
oh there it is yeah it'll come up it um uh no signal
yeah yeah it says something now adjusting
okay
oh that's strange
okay
and one more time
mm
sorry cou could you go back for a second uh switching on off channel uh volume okay that's great


so in the u user interface requirements uh uh uh we we have been able to identify what are the basic
buttons that we do want um but um
so so at this stage uh how we go about implementing those button we will not identify or
i mean in we can completely do away with buttons and uh have some kind of a fancy user interface or something like
that but uh is is there any uh uh any thoughts on that
right
yeah and it'll make the costs yeah
right
uh i think the co costs will also play a big role when we come to know about them so well we can probably
wait until t we have more knowledge on that uh i if the if the costs allow we can have like an l c d  display
and uh with um because we do want something fancy and fashionable as well so
yeah cool
try to press oh okay yep

mm
right
mm hmm

mm
right
mm hmm
hmm
right
mm mm

mm
some kind of a ring some

right
hmm
okay that's great thanks
mm
i think one of the very interesting things that came up in um uh
ka kate cat cat's uh presentation was um uh this
this issue of uh uh like voice recognition being more popular with uh younger people
so if we need to have a target group um then uh
i think as far as the m motto of our company is concerned if we want to have something sleek and uh you know
good looking uh we are better off targeting a younger audience then um you know people who
are comparatively elderly um
right
right bu but but the survey did say that f things like voice recognition are more popular with them so if you want to put in something stylish then uh th it'll certainly be more popular with this i ye with the younger people as compared to older people yeah
right and
right
mm
right but uh still if if you can go back to that slide and uh how popular was it oh oh
okay that's alright if you can just look it up on your computer wh uh um people between twenty
five to thirty five uh how popular was so it was sti still still quite popular
amongst them so even they are seventy six percent is that high amount
alright
yeah so you're more likely to b
yeah
yeah
mm
bu but even even in the case of twenty five to thirty five it's quite popular right so mm uh are are are
mm
mm
um i was having a a general outlook on um m most like sophisticated
features but voice recognition itself i'm not very sure about because one of the p uh things that cat pointed out was
uh uh how do we go about implementing it uh and uh
yeah but how frequently do we use it anyway and um uh h ho how good is it you know uh voice recognition softwares are still quite uh
yeah
right
right
okay o
right
mm

right
yeah
okay so it seems like a feasible thing to implement uh for for a limited yeah
mm w
what uh
mm
what wh uh what i was thinking is that there is this uh separation between
what the channels are on t v  and how they are numbered on the remote control if we can do with
away with that our product can be really popular uh in the sense that uh a person can say i want to watch
uh i t v  one instead of saying that i want to go onto channel number forty five yeah so if uh if
something like that can be incorporated some kind of
mm hmm
alright
yeah that's
right
mm



mm yeah and it might become very difficult from a distance for the television to understand what you're saying because of the noise factor for the remote control being cl i mean it'll it'll mm
yeah
mm so uh wh another thing uh that can be used is that uh there can be a beeper button
on the t v  so you can go and press that button and um and the remote control wherever it is it'll
beep so we we can probably come to know where it is
right yeah yeah yeah
alright yeah
right
okay

so where exactly is this i
ah okay yeah
yeah yeah in that one right yeah
no
right
i guess i'll find out
wha what was it again that i was supposed to look into con components oh

cool do you wanna give me the little cable thing
yeah
cool
ah that's why it won't meet okay cool
yep cool okay functional requirements
alright yeah
it's working
cool okay so
what i have wh where i've got my information from is a survey where the usability lab um observed
remote control use with um a hundred subjects and then they gave them a questionnaire
um so it was all about you know how people feel about the look and feel of the remote control you know what's the most annoying things
about remote controls and um the possibility of speech recognition and l c d  screens in remote
control not that they actually gave me any answers on the l c d  screens so i should have taken that bit out but anyway
um okay so what they found is that people don't like how
current remote controls are so you know definitely you should be looking at something quite different
um seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly uh the other twenty five percent have no
fashion sense uh eighty percent of users would spend more to get um
you know a nice looking remote control um current remote controls they don't match the user behaviour
well as you'll see on the next slide um i dunno what zapping is but
oh right but you have that little thing that comes up at the bottom and tells you what's on um okay fifty percent of
users say they only use ten percent of the buttons so that's going back to what you know we were saying earlier about you know do you need
all the buttons on the remote control they just make it look ugly okay cool um so this is my little graph thing
mm k
okay well i can send it to all of you what it is is um it's cones 'cause i thought they'd be more exciting um but ooh where's it go
back
oh
oh yes cool okay i'm gonna stop playing with the little pointy thing um okay so
like what it shows is how much things are used relatively and what you can clearly
see from that is the thing that's used most is the channel selection what you can't see is volume selection it's a little bit higher
than all the others
yeah so what the graph shows is that you know power channel selection
and volume selection are important and the rest of them you know nobody really uses
and so that's the the numbers along the top represent their like um
their importance you know so on a scale of one to ten how important is that and you know
channel selection and volume selection are absolutely essential and the power well it's not quite so essential apparently
although i don't understand how it couldn't be um and everything else i think you know you can forget about having those buttons
on the remote control 'cause they're just not needed and they're not used
okay this is the bit that the email messed up for me and that's what i was fiddling about with at the beginning of the thing okay cool
so um okay so this is what people find annoying about remote controls uh that they get lost
that the uh you know they're not intuitive and that they're bad for repetitive strain injury i think
if you're watching enough t v  to get repetitive strain injury from um you know watching t v  then that's
the least of your problems but you know it's up there um that yeah okay so um
i mean the the r s i  thing would be that like when you have the computer keyboards and you keep
your wrists up would be something that encourages you want something with an ergonomic t design that encourages good use of the remote
control and you know not straining your wrists watching t v 
yes okay cool right um sorry this is pink because i was copying and pasting the table
and i didn't have time to white it out again um okay but that shows how people whether they would
pay more for voice recognition software so you can see from that that you know younger people
to the age of thirty five are quite likely to pay quite a lot more f well quite are quite likely to pay more for voice recognition software
whereas as people get older they're a bit more sceptical about it and they're less willing to to try it um
so clearly voice recognition is something to think about but um you know i d i do wonder how well that
would work given that a t v  you know tends to be people talking and um you
know how are you going to stop it from just flipping channels whilst watching t v 
um okay
cool um okay so these are my personal preferences
so you have sleek stylish sophisticated you know so something that's
you know a bit cool um you know functional so it's useful but minimalist
um there's a there's an important thing that you know people use when you know when you're filling up your
home you know a lot of people fill up their home with bits of crap basically you know and you've got all this stuff and you're just like what the hell is that who is ever
gonna use it you know so things should either be functional or beautiful or preferably both so i think we need to aim for
both um okay then a long battery life like you were talking about earlier and um you know
i was thinking that solar power would be quite cool because you know your remote control just sits there and you could just sit it in the sunshine and
save the environment a bit um and then like a locator so you know kind of like you have for a
mobile phone or not a mobile phone
yeah that's it you know
i know it's weird my flatmate and i were talking about this on the way into uni this morning and i was like i need to get one for everything
so yeah so maybe something where you clap and then it beeps something a kind of sound that you don't often hear on the t v 
you know 'cause you don't want your remote control beeping every five minutes 'cause you you'd then deliberately
lose it by throwing it out the window or something so okay cool that's me
cat's ca
yeah i mean that's the thing is that it didn't say in the survey you know whether you know these are the people that will pay more for a more stylish remote control but i'm assuming you know yes
well that's when you go to uni isn't it so you know
yeah
oh i've unplugged it do you want me to
yeah
seventy six point three percent
yeah
yeah i kn i mean i know what you're saying about the fifteen to twenty five year olds but i mean it has been proven that that people of that age group
have a higher disposable income because they don't have like i mean you know if you're at university you're paying your rent
but you don't have a mortgage you don't have a life insurance policy you don't
normally have a car yeah so you're still learning to drive actually so that just costs more than a car but yeah um so i mean like it is an age group to target really i think
no i mean that's what that's like fifteen pounds you know i think
yeah i d i don't know many people without a t v  we didn't have a t v  last year and everyone thought we were off our heads you know

yeah i d well we've we've got quite a d decent t v 
yeah
i think i think the fact that you know ninety one point two percent of fifteen to twenty five year olds are saying yes
i would pay more for a voice recognition remote control does say quite a lot really you know so i
mean that and the disposable income and i don't think it's something to ignore
you know
is not a massive difference you know no do totally
you do have it in your mobile phone though don't you because you have like i mean every mobile phone now has like call this person and it calls them
i don't know
yeah
s so
y you'd maybe need a code word do you know what i mean so like when you say change except that's
being said quite a lot on t v  so maybe like you know remote i mean how often do people say remote on t v 
although i only watch charmed so really i wouldn't know but like so you'd just say remote five
you know remote ten remote one two nine
i don't think there's a lot of uh voice recognition remote controls
yeah that would be another way to do it
yeah but then the code word would be even more important because i mean sky advertise on every channel don't they you know so then it would be you'd be watching charmed and then the sky advert would come on and it would change to sky
yeah yeah and that would be really annoying
yeah
do you not think that defeats the object of having voice recognition on a remote control though
yeah you know so you have to have the remote control it's more like if you lost it and it's down the sofa sometime you can yell at it and it'll just change it you can look for it later yeah
yeah yeah i suppose nearer to you but a b like if you have surround sound then
yeah
yeah 'cause it's it's quite important that you don't lose the the bit to locate the remote control
yeah definitely yeah
oh so y you want our um powerpoint presentations in there hey
okay
there you go
but is everyone's called functional requirements
okay so that's good that's me done
okay cool



all hooked up
okay so now we are here at the functional design meeting um
hopefully this meeting i'll be doing a little bit less talking than i did last time 'cause this is when you get to show us what you've been
doing individually the agenda for the meeting i put it in the sh
shared documents folder i don't know if that meant that you could see it or not
did anyone no oh well um i'll try and do that for the next meeting as well so if you check in there there's a shared project documents folder um and it should be in there
project documents yeah so i'll put it in there is it best if i send you an email maybe to let you know it's there
yep i'll do that next time um i'll act as secretary for this meeting and just take minutes as we go through and then i'll send them to you after the meeting
the main the main focus of this meeting is your presentations that you've been preparing during the time
so we'll go through each of you one by one um then we need to briefly discuss
the new project requirements that were sent to us i just sent at the last minute i'm sorry about that
but we can see how that affects what you were you were doing um and
then we need to by the end of the meeting come to some kind of decision on
who our target group's going to be and what the functions of the remote control that's the the main goal
is to come up with those two things target group and functions of the remote control
and we've got forty minutes to do that in
so
i would
say yeah
as uh who it is that we're going to be trying to sell this thing to yeah
so we need to yeah we need to have a fairly defined group that that we want to focus on and then look at the functions um of the dem remote control itself
so with that i think it's best if i hand over to you does anyone have a preference for going first
you wanna go first okay so we need to unplug my laptop and plug in yours
i assume we just pull it out
just before you start to make it easier would you three mind emailing me your presentations once we you don't have to do it now but when once you go back just so that i don't have to scribble everything down
hmm
mm hmm
okay
do you have any um i idea about costs at this point br
okay
'cause that's something to consider i guess if we're if we're using more advanced technology it might
increase the price
yeah
that's fine
are there any more
questions or shall we just skip straight to the next one and then we can discuss all of them together at the end
yeah i think that will do okay so do you want to
yes shall shall we pull this up i think that has to come out of there
yeah
yeah i thought those last minute things they're gonna hit you the worst
it ta takes a little
oh and have you you need to then also press on yours function f  eight so the blue function key at the bottom and f  eight
now it's coming computer no signal
maybe again
okay adjusting
there we go there we go
oh if you press if you press function and that again there's there's usually three modes one where it's only here one where it's only there and one where it's both
okay so one more time
should yeah just wait for a moment adjusting
okay
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah if i mean that was the the directive that came through from management but if we had a a decent case for that we really think it's important to include video and d v d  i could get back to them and see
it's w it's just whether it's worth arguing about
mm hmm
yeah
mm hmm
okay are there any questions for clarification of maarika before we go on to the next one
mm hmm
mm
mm
mm hmm
sure we can discuss that maybe after the next one do you want to yeah
oh i'm getting hungry
you set
uh we need to do the function key thing so that it comes up on here
hello
is it plugged in prop it's working okay
excellent

it's um switching between channels sort of randomly going through

mm
ooh that's a bit difficult to see
if you explain it to us it'll be fine
yeah
i liked the i liked the litt ooh come back
no

okay
mm hmm that's the next one along yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm

the remote control

mm hmm

that's alright
mm
keys and things like that yeah whistle and it screams at you yeah

mm hmm

that's you excellent
um
i'm just gonna tick yes
so we've got about ten fifteen minutes to discuss
mm hmm
yeah
mm hmm
yeah then again i guess the th where it was most popular was the fifteen to twenty five bracket and the i don't know how often they're buying televisions
yeah but you don't have much money generally i would've thought it's it's more that twenty five to thirty five when people are really moving out and they've got their first job and they want their nice toys and
o oh it's on sorry we unplugged it
here let me
yeah
mm hmm
yeah
yeah they've got no commitments and
usually not a car and all of those things
kids yeah

yeah and if we're if we're talking twenty five euros as a price that's not unaffordable even for young people
yeah


yeah
but do they
but the t v s are often kind of someone's old t v  that's blah blah and be a bit strange to have a fancy rome remote

mm
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah if we ta if we take fifteen to thirty five but that then does imply that we should try and incorporate voice recognition is that gonna have a an implication for the technical specs
mm hmm
yeah
yeah with um but with a t v  remote it's gonna be quite limited if we're t saying the main things people want to do is on off channel five
louder tha that should be relatively simple
mm
yeah

mm hmm
yeah but maybe if you wanna look into that just to just to check um so if we go for the the fifteen to thirty five age group
and then of course we're going to get th anyone who's older than thirty five who wants to look young and hip and trendy and has the money then they'll they'll still go for the same advertising
yeah i think we need both
yeah
mm
uh huh uh huh
so that if that was in the the voice recognition that would be great
yeah
yeah

watch sky and yeah
mm hmm
but that's definitely a possibility
yeah
so that you can yell at it yeah


yeah
alright
mm
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
mm hmm
that's but then if you're buying the remote separately but y you could have something but i if it was something that you could like stick onto the t v  or something some like a two p if you bought it in a two part pack so one part attaches to the t v 
the l
well that's right but it solves the problem of having different noises
yeah okay i think we're gonna have to wrap this up um
but if we go away with that that kind of general
um specification in mind that we're looking at fifteen to thirty five year olds we want
it to look simple but still have the buttons so it's easy to use but only those key buttons
the major buttons and then one sort of menu one and then voice recognition included
as an option um but that obviously needs a little bit more working out as to whether it's really feasible
and some of those problems we were mentioning um
what we have to do now is to go back to our little places complete our questionnaire and some
sort of summarisation which y you'll get immediately by email send me your presentations so that i can use
them to make the minutes and then we've got a lunch break and after lunch we go back to
our own little stations and have thirty minutes more work um i'll put
the minutes in that project documents folder but i'll send you an email when i do it so that you know it should be on your
desktop so on the yeah so i'll put it i'll put them there
as soon as i've written them
yeah and email them round
yeah that would be great
oh yeah put them in there yeah then you don't have to email them
no they're all called something slightly different technical requirements and something something yeah so if you put them in there we'll all be able to see them and refer to them if we need to
um as to where we're going from here you're going to look at the components concept yeah whatever that means
yeah
you'll be looking you'll be looking at the user interface concept on something conceptual and
you're watching trends to see how we go and surely voice recognition'll fall off the map or something that
um we'll keep keep our options op hmm
components yeah
no we have we have after lunch we have thirty minutes to ourselves to prepare so that's fine w before lunch we just have to complete the questionnaire and some sort of summary
okay right on time okay so you can i guess we'll see you for lunch in a sec

no
mm
um um wi on on a what oh project project documents yeah yeah yeah okay
oh okay yeah
yes i think so
yeah the last minute yeah yeah
yeah
um
okay hmm
mm
okay yeah afterwards yeah okay
thanks
i think we need like some general discussion at the end probably
yeah yeah i think since since we were discussing some um design issues then i i i would like to continue okay yeah
thanks oh i

okay i hope wait should it just
there's just nothing
oh right right right um
okay
nothin okay something is coming up
no signal why
oh my my computer went blank now
adjusting
but i don't see anything i don't see anything on my computer now this is the problem but
um
uh now it's okay no no
oh okay
okay that's fine that's good
okay let's start from the beginning so i'm going to speak about technical functions design uh
just like some some first issues that came up
um 'kay so the method i was um adopting at this point it's
not um for the for the whole um period of the um
all the project but it's just at th at this very moment um uh my method was um to look
at um other um remote controls uh so mostly just
by searching on the web and to see what um functionality they used and then
um after having got this inspiration and having compared what i found on the web um just to think
about what the de what the user really needs and what um what the user might desire as additional
uh functionalities
and yeah and then just to um put the main function of the remote control in
in words um so the findings uh were um that the main function
of the remote control is is just sending messages to the television set so this quite
straightforward and uh w some of the main functions would be switching on switching off uh then the user
would like to switch the channel um for example just
m changing to the next channel to to flip through all all of the possible channels or then
mm uh the other possibility would be that um she might just want to choose one particular channel
so we would need the numbers and and also the volume is very important um
um i als okay
'kay
um um among the findings i found that m m most of the curr mm presently available
remote controls also include other mm functionalities um in their design like
operating a v c r  but they don't seem to be able to deal with d v d  players but then there
are surely there are many other functionali functions that could possibly be added to them but according
to the last minute update um actually um we do not want to have all this complicated
functions added to our design so my personal preferences would be uh to
keep the mm the whole remote control small um just like the physical size
and then it must be easy to use so it must follow some conventions um like whereabouts you find the on
off button and maybe the colour tends to be red or something
um then yeah the must have buttons would be on off and then
the channel numbers and then um the one that allows us to go to the next or the previous channel
and then volume has to be there but then um other functionalities um could be just
uh there could be a menu button and you could change things on the screen then um for example
brightness and mm similar functions could be just um done through the menu
and yeah the last question i had about whether we wanted to incorporate n uh more functionalities
the answer was already no because of the last minute update so at the for the time being that's uh that's all if
you have questions
yeah and also it's it's um other question is uh because there are so many different
and there are so many different things that could possibly be included because besides video and d v d  there
are the mm um video c d s and whatever so it might
be problematic to to choose between all these possible things
um well i think the buttons are still mm kind of the most um easy for the user to use i mean
um what other options would you have a little screen or something but this would be really kind of i think a
lot of learning for the user and and i mean the user just wants to get um get a result um
quickly not to spend time in like um giving several orders um i dunno
i think i th i would i would think the put the buttons but if if you have other mm proposals
um
yeah
yeah
mm hmm
yep
uh am i going in the right direction no wait
okay here it comes
okay here you are

um that's very good very interesting
mm hmm
yeah yeah you share a television or something that yeah
it was seventy something yeah yeah
yeah this this is not unaffordable but the problem is whether people need it whether they do have a t v  to use its full
yeah
common the students yeah yeah the s the stu yeah and the remote control might not yeah it might not even function with the old t v 
yeah we're still yeah or w maybe we can just kind of uh uh
yeah but at the same time i think maybe we can we can just decide to to have both of these groups as our target because actually i mean they're all still re young people yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
an
yeah
yeah
yeah but uh um
yeah yeah sure yeah yeah
yeah
yeah w well now the v the voice recognition if if it works wonderfully w we could possibly do away with
all buttons but i think this is not really the right moment yet because people are just so used to buttons and um yeah
it's it's kind of safer so we we need both so the voice recognition would be just an extra it wouldn't really
reduce the size of the remote
yeah but m but on the other hand remote control isn't as close to you you probably might just just uh speak into it and and the t v  would be already further away so it might not pick up the other things coming from there
yeah but then the remote control i think i mean um the idea is kind of it's it's not that it's sitting there
on on top of the television because then you could already yell at the television and you wouldn't you you wouldn't need the remote control so the
remote control is still something you keep n near yourself
yeah yeah yeah
no but i i i was just defending the the fact why why we want to keep the remote control close to us a and uh not to yell at it from the distance
okay
oh yeah yeah
okay yeah mm hmm
the major ones yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah
did you find it it's just yeah yeah
oh so so we'll just put them i there we we yeah w we won't even okay
yeah
yeah

uh something conceptual yeah
hmm sorry but um the next meeting um are we going to have it um right after lunch or shall we prepare our
to prepare okay yeah that's good
okay
cool

okay see you
okay all set welcome to the conceptual design meeting
the agenda the opening i'll again be the secretary and make minutes
take minutes uh and it will be three presentations just like the last meeting
so um who wants to start off technical uh designer again okay
uh yeah uh before we begin it i want to say i've i've put the minutes of the uh second meeting
in the shared folder but they're still not uh quite okay it uh it uh still some
technical difficulties so the the first part of the minutes are very hard to read because there are two documents
that uh were layered over each other so but uh from now on i won't use my
pen anymore so will be p just ordinary keyboard
i think it will
will be more uh easy for you to read the minutes
twelve and a half
actually
what are those t tooth uh brushes or so
but it's actually kind of uh well it resembles the design i had in mind for this proj you know the the cartoonish alessi kind of design
and we can we can steal their ideas
huh
well it's a possibility too
uh uh
okay
next time we're here
oh okay
okay
oh we decided upon that in the last meeting
didn't we
oh okay well tha i didn't receive any new requirements or somethi just no but we decided to use only b basic functions only
okay
well we maybe we can think of that later w just these are the ones you already summed up in the
okay
yeah
that might get redundant also maybe i don't know what kind of information it would
yeah yeah it's okay

okay that's not
it was not a good idea
okay
no no
but you do mention the next and previous uh button

oh okay o okay okay
huh
mm hmm
well w when we only use basic functions we have the possibility to make the buttons larger
well i think we already agreed upon the fact that the the the skip buttons and the cha and the volume buttons th th those two have yeah they have to be large uh i mean th th the the two two basic buttons you know the to skip channels and to uh
i think yeah i don't know why but i think that is that's t trendy too because that's the mo it it you know it's uh acc acc um accentu uh how do you say it
it puts an extra accent on the the on the simplicity of our remotes to j to make these two most basic functions extra big like t
yeah
and you want to acc accentuate that you know
so
okay
no uh that's coo it's cool

well maybe c then we have to do something with sponge bob then
it doesn't stroke with the with the dark colours
not the dark colours okay
okay
for diversity or something uh
no but i i i think that uh our design already resembles so a piece of fruit it's like a pear or something
no i don't think you have to do it like
yeah but it that doesn't have to remind you you know like explicitly of s our f of a of a specific piece
of fruit but just you know like the the the the round curves and so y i i think this y it already sem resembles
uh something like a pear to me or something
yeah
you do get the idea eh the fruity kind of round 'kay
yeah uh yeah i don't know uh this is a b yeah
yeah yeah of course we have uh
we have a very big uh the s
of d design team yeah
yeah but
it's pear i guess

no
no but i think it's it's already what we were were up to uh it's it doesn't have to resemble uh what i already said a specific piece of fruit but just you know like a fruity thing going on and it's it looks fruity to me
and uh but i do like the yeah i do like uh the f uh to the idea of making a a y uh a catchy colour design and a d because i do i think a dark colour would be nice too
maybe it's too much you know
okay but what are the this is yellow
but i don't think our our company colours are this fashionable
yeah on uh n uh on the bottom of the remote you can do
okay
okay you can you open the conceptual design presentation
see what was on the agenda
this is his own remote because um maybe we can start with the technical uh functions but i don't think it's there uh yeah um do we want to um use an l c d  display for example
me neither
yeah but it's so
i don't think we should do it
yeah but no i do i think it's a bit redundant actually and it's also not i don't th even think it it looks s like sexy or something it's
but you're already watching the t v  you're not gonna watch your remote control


i really understand you want to make your job more exciting by putting an l c d  in it but i i really don't think it's a good
n goo because it also doesn't stroke with we wanted uh c when we talk about the materials
uh it's a good idea to use these plastic materials with soft rubber stuff on it it was our idea you know to give it a more sturdy
look and that you ca like you can throw with it but i don't think a l c d  display fits in that image you know it's like
more vulnerable and it adds nothing really you know
yeah yeah you could make it but it's just it it doesn't i don't think it it's coherent with the design we're after
but that's my opinion well you you y okay we can vote for it you want the l c d  display i don't want to and he doesn't so it's up to him if we wanna
and i've read somewhere that i've got some kind of veto veto uh rights
so i can also say
but did we skip the yeah you could do m but what what i so what i but do you think we should
we're not even sure what what information we want to display on it so
nah that's not gonna work
yeah
oh well uh i've seen it done before do you know th like the the bigger rem uh universal remotes they have d l c d  displays but then it's very functional to indicate which what uh uh device you are controlling so it's that that's what i've seen
but it just it j it doesn't doesn't match with the our whole basic concept
well yeah yeah okay that's maybe not the most important but it's just
i don't think so
yeah well do you ha do you have to you haven't looked after the trendiness of l c d  displays have you

yeah yeah yeah
yeah but we're gonna if it
then uh then you better don't yeah d

uh uh i really don't feel the whole idea of an l c d  display i'm sorry it can't co you cannot convince me i don't know how well how to with you guys but
i don't really feel it we already we're uh yeah we already have the the th th th base station gadgets and want and it uh uh do it has to be a simple design which sturdy which soft
i don't think
i j uh and really i don't see how the the l c d  display is gonna add anything you know on a design
level uh i think it's slicker to have no l  ceds y we want to
it's simplicity w you have two big buttons and you can do whatever you want with these two buttons so you don't need
an l c d 
it doesn't fit in our philosophy uh behind the whole remote
yeah but we already have the docking station which is
it has to be developed but no but it that's that's our that's our killer feature that's our what makes it special
yeah we're gonna develop our own r n docking station

uh but re we really have to cut this off i re i know you i i i i i get the idea you really like it
you know the the l c d  thing but i i think it's it's not a good idea and we have already mentioned all the arguments
i don't uh do you guys agre how do you guys think i d
okay we s skip the l c d  display i'm sorry maybe you can do something if we are at your own place or make it make it make it happen in your basement or something
but
probably so okay but for the technical part the m material i think uh it was a good idea to use the plastic and uh the rubber uh
yeah yeah yeah p exactly this is what it w yeah but it it was already what we're uh we're after you know to give it uh you know
the soft touch in your hands and also to know like yeah that is y the b airbag
kind of thing you can st throw it at your little brother's head
yeah no no no not that comfy
yeah yeah yeah okay that's a that's a good point and that's why i like the dark t col dark colour bit you know because it may be the design uh it's uh maybe it is a bit of the
it's a bit nineties maybe what we're what we're up to rat fun to this point
yeah that's that's true but but it has to be a little big solid it mustn't be too n you know th too overwhelming then when you put it on your just
yeah
yeah maybe so
no uh i don't like the yellow and black combination but it is our company colours apparently

i don't like yellow and uh maybe i don't know
but
okay but what uh what are other tef technical things we have to discuss

should we do that i don't think you we should do that maybe just bring it out in different colours but not af that you can switch fronts afterwards that's also too much people don't wanna spend more money on their remote control i guess
yeah yeah
but uh without gon uh okay so are we through the technical part then
okay so we uh agreed upon uh n uh well not u unanimously or how you call it but yeah
the materials you uh mentioned in your your personal preferences were all were quite okay o o only only the last point your no titanium's not not out of question i guess
but is it possible to use both the the plastic and so uh soft things and t p titanium as well makes it in a homogeneous uh design

it will it will break other stuff w when it's plastic as well
yeah
no but uh uh you should ma yeah
okay think of the possibilities and make it in completely titanium well would it be more trendy more chic
yeah but i i really like the idea of the the the plastic and the big kind of thing but the question is i then it's you know is is it fits in our s philosophy to make it uh sturdy and simple and uh know like uh
when you make it titanium it becomes more like some kind of gadget you actually don't need and when it's big and plastic it's like some fun stuff you can always have around it's always fun to have something big and plastic around
yeah that's beautiful
oh maybe th maybe this is an
no i do like the idea of maybe a t titanium kind type of body w and then with s plastic colouration around it you know like the the soft stuff but i don't know if it's possible
but you can't make the plastic give uh the ti titanium look but make it just like shiny maybe we should uh shou
and uh and
maybe we sh should we t i don't know if we should talk about uh how how much time have we got left
forty minutes
okay
you putting in different colours
okay
okay yeah but w yeah well it is it's a possibility but let's think about the bas
mm hmm mm hmm but wha th our basic idea y i mean you gonna we're probably gonna have like two
type of materials like the d d b the plastic uh enclosure and then the the pads that surround it and and pro and lights
we have to incorporate the lights too but uh do w gonna gonna are we going to give it a two tone colour look
like the the plastic mould is in in one colour and the s the cushion pads around it are in another
colour is that the idea is that a good idea
how many colours are we how many colours are we gonna we're uh uh f uh f only five minutes left by the way how many colours are we gonna give it like two tone colour t
i think maybe the case itself should be in one colour and then the rubber of the buttons and the cushions as well should be in another colour
okay but not more than well yeah it's no maybe we should talk about it on a l in a later meeting
okay but we have to uh think of some other uh important things uh oh yeah the the functionalities of the the buttons
no

i think this is okay the so we have the basic then we have the numbers we have the power button we have we have a teletext button
and maybe want to access a a menu or something most t v s have a menu
yeah but i think you ha i really need a menu button that's just i the only button only
you know i
no i think most t v s have an uh a menu nowadays to access the uh uh screen settings and so
but that that covers all the all the other settings it covers everything then
no you can use the
and you al can also use the normal skip buttons for that th in that way we have like only the numbers the power
button skip and volume and then uh uh ten uh rem uh yeah mute a teletext
and a menu and then then i that's it it's all we need okay uh
another stuf some stuff about the the the design of the docking station something important about a s uh no uh which sh
uh should remind us of the remote itself i guess
uh in one colour just use
i think the spongy thing already um comes forward in the in the in the cushions pads and things on the s uh side and we will make it spongy and and uh and uh well the fruity thing is just the shape should be fru i did i think this is kind of fruity you know just round shapes with uh
yeah but we're gonna have to we really have to think i think colours is very important because it has to be flashy but and but it d it doesn't
have to be annoying that when you uh know some things is just over the top and when you have it on your table for more than two weeks you it just
gets annoying because it's so big and flashy uh it has to be some level of subtlety but we have to still have to think of
how we manage to uh
to get to that
okay guess we're through then
but we i think also we just so we have to do something with colour but also i i think we have to keep the dark colour thing in mind i think that's uh adds to the too much colour maybe m um
but our des design experts will uh work that out okay well i think the meeting will be over within a minute so we will wrap up
or is there anything we'd like to discuss
that's right
okay
okay
well you will read the minutes uh in the you can find them in the pro probably yeah uh no for su for sure because i'm will now type them out
uh y yeah
i think uh
but toilet paper roll and uh
okay
yep i was waiting for the l last message but
mm yeah
uh okay
again
hmm
mm hmm

uh may be better yeah
yeah
oh
oh titanium is
probably trendy i think
well maybe a little bit expensive
i don't know
yeah production cost


i
different colours also
yeah
okay
uh
ah
well i shall go to the next slide um
um i still don't have any information about user requirements i was thinking about just uh the basic functions and i got uh
yeah but but then wh i don't know when there are new user requirements i ha i ha i have the i have
nothing
well i have here a couple of basic functions i could think of
i dunno if they're maybe a little bit more but
yeah
yeah i i uh well i pointed them out here just to make it a little bit easier um
another function uh is of course we already discuss it on the side um
i don't know what costs of it uh i've no idea about it uh i was also looking
for what you said for i got an email uh uh about uh l c d  in in in
front of the remote control i don't know if that's a good idea or maybe it's a little
bit
too much for twelve and a half
production if we got already uh something like a base
yeah i don't know i d i uh ju i was just thinking about it then i got a pop ups to go to the meeting but
the remote control a little uh too a little bit
a little bit too big i think
exactly
um yeah well the functions are are not more to discuss i think it's it's just the base things we already discussed that the no v c r  or that kind of uh so that's very easy
um
mm hmm well that's next channel i mean next channel uh
um oh i i got an email with with an uh a remote control with a base so it's uh just an idea
and i um
uh thinked of the button sizes and i'm not sure uh if they have to be big or uh just small

well i'm not a e i'm the expert for user friendly but not for trendiness
maybe it
well uh okay that's your point um yeah yeah okay
yeah i've nothing to s
uh with a little bit larger yeah i thought so but maybe with the
yeah that groups large
yeah
most the most used uh buttons
true yeah
yeah
okay uh that was all y uh personal preference i didn't have i didn't had any time left so yeah

it's there
yeah click on it
couple time





well how uh
but how do we use uh fruits and vegetables in christ's sake with remote control uh make it a banana


yeah but th yeah but that
yeah but that's
yeah uh uh
but d don't we need a creative artist or something like that to m make it to feel like a a a a vegetable or fruit

yeah


but we we have to um there have to be the the the the firm colours our own uh colours has to be in it yellow a real reaction
uh yeah
we uh f
a yellow do
uh yeah
yeah and the button then
okay yeah
okay
lazy
yeah
well well what would you display on it then
but is it isn't that a already on t v  a lot of new t v s
yeah
yeah and we also have to yeah

and i also


yeah i dunno
oh okay
we can you away
yeah i don't know uh uh i i if it's it's a simple p
no that that's right and uh i also have to think about new functions maybe buttons or something like that to control it kind of l c d  or something or
but how does it display then w when i go to the second channel what what does it show me
about that programme
yeah
is it fashion
i don't know that's not up to you that's up to market if i if it's trendy because our our motto is we put fashion

yeah if you want to be trendy you have to be coloured coloured
if you have black and white or something or grey that's

it's too much uh maybe uh with with the l c d  and the docking station and
with one thing special not a whole package of specialty
and uh the
yeah
it's just an it's just an idea it's a it's
true
well uh i uh
yeah i dunno

no it's too much
it's overdone

democratically

with a spongy bob feel
yeah
yeah you just can drop it yeah
yeah
but not black i think
well if if it's fruit and vegetables it have to be colourful
but can we ge uh uh
can we combine it or something uh with uh yellow and black
make it a bee
a bee
yeah it's our yeah we we have to use yellow

different fronts
yeah
uh you can you can l uh let choose the customer which colour he wants yeah yeah three three or four uh four uh colours or something like that
well yeah the
three to one that's
and tita uh titanium is uh is is it a no is
it's just like that th this titanium
no not all not all of them

uh i think titanium nowadays is way more often used than plastic
in trendy things
yeah
it's cold in the winter
yeah
you have that uh m p  three player of nike i saw isn't that titanium with a little bit of rubber
isn't it
is plastic well it's titanium looking
yeah he is here he is uh the i don't know if you know the m p  three player of nike 'kay uh that that's very uh with rubber so it's very
rough
true
yeah yeah true yeah maybe that's good idea yeah but if you want to la uh yeah last longer than two weeks or something like that you can maybe
i don't know what time does

the rubber
yeah uh no not too much i think
or you just make uh one colour uh maybe with a a z a kind of like a big wave or something like uh
in in another colour not more than two colours i think it's a g a little bit too flashy
the funct yeah i was i was thinking about th the st do we still want a joystick idea
yeah
the volume teletext and

yeah yeah yeah yeah b
yeah but wha what kind of menu is uh isn't that different from every television

mute
yeah
okay that's not mu not much functions so

okay
yeah
too much colour i it uh when you got it in a living room it's too much maybe it has to be
yeah
no
oh okay yeah
yeah i hope so and the other thing is that you don't have kind of prototype or something like that you see a kinda prototype you can a little bit more uh
yeah
with you laptop yeah
oh my god
well you are we're not

yes

okay when we talk about uh components design um it's really about the material and the and uh uh really the stuff we build uh the remote controls of
um a remote control consist of uh components and the components of a remote control
consist of uh properties and material we have to choose th uh these uh wisely and
it could affect uh uh a kind of grow of in uh in buying uh
the remote controls
um the components of a remote control are of course uh the case uh the properties
of the case um it has to be solid uh in hard material like uh hard
plastic uh with soft rubber for uh falling and and uh
uh yeah it feels uh good in your hand
mm the buttons has to be uh solid too and the material is soft rubber uh i've got a uh email from the possibilities of real reaction
um
uh they're telling me that um when we build uh a remote control of um of plastic or rubber the uh buttons have to be uh rubber too mm
it's okay yeah
i when we use a rubbled a doubled curved case we must use a rubber push buttons
to uh the the rubber double curved case is a is a t uh three dimensional uh
curve in the in the design which is uh necessary when we want to be trendy uh
um
the energy source uh i've got a lot of possibilities for that too um
uh the basic battery which i thi prefer because of its uh its non uh non depending of of of uh um
uh here you have to have a hand uh yeah kinetic uh
energy also in uh this one like in the watches but a remote control can lie on a table for
a day and then you push uh a button and so you don't have to uh walk with it all
the all the time mm solar cells are also uh a bit weird
for uh remote controls
um
uh also the case material uh i think that plastic is the is the best with rubber because uh wood or titanium
would also be a bit weird
uh they don't tell anything about the cost of uh titanium
um
the chip uh the chip set uh and the board is uh all off the shelf also the speaker in the remote control when we want to retrieve it um the base station is also off the shelf all the materials and the
components are uh just available in uh
in our uh factory
mm
i've told about uh the three first points mm the simple electronical
chip uh is is available uh with the led transmitter
uh transmitter uh it's all uh off the shelf and even the speaker and the wireless
retriever are all uh available in our company
um another possibility i uh
yeah i looked up on was uh the l c d  displays could be uh
something special to our uh remote control and it's possible but it only cost a bit more but maybe it can be uh within the limits of twenty five euros
ah yeah
i th i got an email with uh some examples and it these were were the most trendiest one you see uh a covers which can be
um i don't know um
yes
yes maybe we can uh bri uh bring a couple of uh couple of types of uh maybe a kind of uh whole uh
um
a whole set of uh different uh remote controls maybe we can bring a whole line uh with uh
with a huge variety of uh
uh house uh stuff like uh maybe radios and uh television also uh in this in this in the same style but
yes because we have to uh we have to we have to bring the logo and all the stuff uh back into it
thank you
uh huh
maybe we can bring t uh uh teletext to the t to the remote control

but you're the expert


you did the research
it's from your research

















grapes


for a big team of artists
but uh but i think we don't have to make
we can't make all uh ten designs we have to make one design i th i i think
but pictures of fruit vegetables vegetables
yes you can put a logo on top of it
yes it's really fruity
with a strawberry on top
only if we
maybe maybe we can make a t v  guide on it for the channel you're on
no no only the t v  channel with the with uh with uh four programmes you can uh zap through them with the page up page down button
yes it can
on your
no on your mobile phone you can y you can read text also so why not on your remote
uh programme uh information or or or or g or a guide
on t on teletext yes also on the internet but
yes but you also want to know what's next
yes that's uh really possible




no



no uh um
y yes you can use uh buttons uh uh w that are already uh on the remote control for double functions
uh then you push a button
the title and the information about the programme but but uh yeah what he said was right about the televisions they have to be uh customised to the
but maybe in future it will be a giant hit and when you are the first
you have the biggest uh
yes you can put uh a little l c d  display on it with uh with lots of information but uh i haven't thought about it
but whe but when you put a a a transparent uh plastic uh
uh screen on top of it it i it isn't vulnerable you can throw with it and
when when you put uh maybe a colour l c d  t uh screen on it it's very special and very trendy to have uh a remote control from

but uh i've got a the email with uh with the possibilities and l c d  was a possibility for the remote control so why don't we use it
no but it doesn't sa say anything about a colour or but mm
i alf i also got a possibility to put uh a scroll button on it but

i didn't think that
yes but o on the
no when y
but it look
yes but that remote controls are already on the market the simple
yes but but when you want to have something special
yes but you had a picture of it from another company



yes it was already made tha the remote control on the docking station
yes he have a picture of it


okay


mayb
i will rule the world with it
yes maybe a bit of a cushion is
yes
like a b yes
maybe it but then we have to look that it uh w uh will not um be too childish to see
yes real real good colours
hmm
but that's not really fruity
uh fronts
of the
we can have uh different uh uh fronts of the
telephone
are these designs
yes
it this a real uh young young and dynamic uh uh styles
yes
yes
but also w
yes b bu but when we use s soft
mm
mm
but it it then it uh you can't throw it it it will uh make a huge noise or break other stuff
when you throw with uh titanium with your remote control no uh
titanium is a bit uh it's a bit harder but also on the colours the young
yes but a titanium remote control when you're uh watching t v  uh or your hands are a little bit sweaty and the
yes
sports and gaming define
yes it's w but it is uh plastic
yes w we can do that on the on the
we can make this as a style too uh this is uh just a
no we c we can make it from the same kind of plastic
uh
i don't have the information uh i i didn't got it
yes
like the m p  three player
uh in a lot of other uh
in a lot of other product uh categories like uh even in b in bags industry
uh they began with uh t typical uh leather bags but then they became stylish
with all all si all sort of colours and w kind of fon of uh of fronts
like we can use on the telephone and it
like eastpack uh began a revolution with it with all this uh kind of bags and and colours and and
yes and and styles they have uh also uh a kind of uh um
uh roses on it a and uh
then we can always uh use the same design for a greater resemblance but with new uh with new colours new yes
there there are three uh components three components type you have the buttons the the case uh itself and the rubber and th
yes
yeah or or when you use the buttons as black it you can use two colours as well uh

but then you have to put uh up and down and uh left and right
okay
uh
what are we going to do now

i will make one in the next uh twenty minutes
back to the pen


okay

keyboard work yeah
alright

that's true i guess yeah

huh
yeah

yep

yeah that'll be for the future i guess

yeah
yeah definitely
alright
yeah that's okay



mm yeah
then you and then you've got a flag s very big r c  yeah

no
next channel previous channel
i think it depends on the function
well if you save uh perhaps uh s tiny buttons aren't user friendly then we wouldn't im implement that of course


oh that's right
yeah
yep
those are probably the the th
yes
those are probably the b four most most used buttons on the th in the remote control
sorry
yeah sure

you don't care no sorry
yeah
oh
go away
come on
oh great
well i've done some research again about trends on the internet
um i've done some investigation and uh well
i uh got some information from fashion watchers from paris and uh milan
some uh some findings the most important thing is fancy look and feel of the remote control uh
well we were going to imply that so that's nice the second important thing is uh innovative technology
in the r c  uh our market really likes really likes that and uh the third
point there in this uh order if of importance the third point is a high ease
of use and uh well for the idea i've put some trends uh for the
market of elderly people dark colours simple recognisable shapes so we probably won't do that
the younger market likes uh well the themes of of this
year are uh surprisingly fruits and vegetables and
spongy material i found this image which is uh
well it symbolises the idea of fruits and vegetables i don't see the spongy part in it but with a
little bit of fancy
exactly i got some ideas uh well yeah pictures isn't really good word but um
some symbols of fruits or vegetables maybe uh catchy colours fruit is uh
yellow green red whatever so remote controls in in catchy colours uh
no we don't want dark colours no i just put them there to uh yeah uh for general
idea and uh the docking st uh i think the spongy material is is very
irritating for the uh remote control itself but to
yeah the to implement some spongy thing maybe we can do it in the in the docking station at the bottom
of the docking station or whatever and uh we could bring one line with a dark colour uh to um
uh p uh yeah uh uh v how do you say
yeah also a bit for elderly people who are a little bit crazy and want maybe want a little
younger design but still the dark colour i mean it it it reaches a different market uh
but it it it doesn't cost really much effort to b to uh bring uh like a black r c  on the market or whatever
yes
yeah there's there's always a
well there there's always empty space of course on a remote control i mean i think this part of the r c 
uh well the upper the upper part or whatever is uh is not
not used with buttons i guess so you you can put some fruity things
no of course not
especially i
yeah yeah yeah exactly
if we make it little bit greenish
a and we could use one of these for the uh w what is it
uh
isn't
wha whatever
yeah sure
yeah
well w we can uh w we can we can produce multiple uh multiple things this is
then the uh pear i don't know the english word so forget it and um
maybe yeah a b a banana is uh is n not easy for a remote control but m yeah
mayb maybe two or three
yeah
no sure but but
b but that's great and and and what i was what what i was saying the catchy colours
yeah
yeah uh not really pictures was a was a bad word but
well we c yeah
yeah sure
maybe we can if if we got our docking station over here i can't draw with this thing but i'll try if this is our docking station we can make our logo over here it doesn't work and then
well the button button over here or whatever i don't know
on the front of course because else you can't find it
well that were my ideas a little bit
i'll close 'em down um go away
conceptual design yes
the agenda
well it's nice of course but i don't i don't know what to display on it i mean
yeah but it should be li like this big and i don't think
yes sure but it it has to to show an entire title of a programme or at least a q a quite quite large part of it and then you get a very large l c d  screen because
yeah i don't know
programme information but
well a lot a lot of t v s indeed show uh when you uh zap to a
but then we also uh w need to bring out a line of t v s which we were planning to but whatever because the t v  has to send information back to the r c  and i don't know if that's possible
yes yes o of course it's possible but you gotta uh implement it in the t v s and i don't think everyone's gonna buy a real reaction t v  within a month after the release of our uh remote control

yeah
that's true that's true it breaks f yeah it it it's not very solid it's uh frag fragile
no no i don't think so ei either
ah
bastard

yeah i guess
no
yeah that's true if you uh yeah
no
well i think it's uh i think it's pretty trendy to be honest uh but um i don't know if if if
well i'm coming back to the costs again but i think uh we gotta build a b pretty cheap design to
to stay within our limits and i think uh especially colour l c d  which is indeed pretty
trendy but i don't think uh i think it will be too expensive
uh did it say a price also uh for for uh monogramme uh l c d  or uh coloured l c d 
yeah really if y if you c i
i in in two thousand and four you can't uh put something on the market which is a monogramme really

yeah
w we've we've gotta find a balance of course and i think
we have a pear

is that so was it it wasn't just a prototype
exactly i've never seen it in a store
i think it's a little too much yeah
okay
no

yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah for the spongy uh feel yeah
yeah airbag
if you drop it if you drop it the airbag comes out yeah

yeah
no
yeah b yeah that's what w i i was pointing at
what oh a bee oh
yeah
hmm
well we can as as i
draw really nicely over there we can put the logo on our uh on our base station uh yeah and maybe very very tiny on the remote control itself but i
yeah i guess that's that's enough
that's way too nokia
yeah definitely just bring more designs on the market
why not yeah
sure

yeah that's true
yeah i think it i think it does
yeah o
on the other hand if you want to make fruit fruity stuff with uh
yeah that's true that's true
yes yeah
what
oh yeah okay yeah
yeah i see
yeah but but but
yeah i th i think that's difficult because uh that's different material and then you gotta have like uh uh uh two material lines of of of
yeah if it's just a colour uh which you uh which you change then i guess it's it's nice to have one of these
uh
yeah
mm hmm
yeah

yeah
uh yeah yeah
yes
new prints on it yep
how do you mean th th the uh base in a in another
yes
how the buttons yeah
yeah
no definitely not
yes definitely
no i think that's too vulnerable
yeah but that's that's i was thinking that's gotta be on the television
mm yeah if it's c if
yeah i think it's okay to to add a menu button for uh and if the t v  doesn't have a menu then
yeah
yeah you can put that on the two eight four and six or whatever
mm yeah
a mute and a teletext and a menu
that's all
hmm
great yeah
yeah definitely are we gonna do something with the uh spongy thing there
yeah that's true that's true
yeah it's kinda fruity and with th with catchy colours uh uh w
yeah definitely
yeah
okay
i guess so
yes
yea yeah
yep
something like that
i guess not
do you guys
no
in the shared folder
you'll see in you email i guess
yeah i don't know i don't know
construct one yeah

alright shall we get back to work great
yeah
bastard
you lazy
g good morning
oh yeah
are you ready you should put the laptop uh right into the square for i for the cameras yes good morning sebastian
i'm fine
um well actually i didn't go didn't feel like it so do you want to open it as read only um i guess i should close it here
okay the waiting is for our marketing expert ruud um project kick off
yes there is actually um i will li list the agenda for today for this meeting
good morning ruud
uh it's important um yeah great it's important that the laptops are um exactly on the square um for the cameras
okay
okay um we're here to develop uh a new product um i'm
sure you've had a mail from our account manager about it um and um this
is the first meeting to to generate some uh uh some ideas about it um
you are here in a specific role uh ruud is here as the marketing expert roo is
here as the user interface designer and sebastian is here uh in the role of industrial
designer is that correct okay um we're going to
do um uh uh a little tool training uh for the tools we are going to use uh during
uh the meetings we are going to have here um then i will tell you a little bit about
my idea of the project plan uh and we will have a discussion uh this meeting
should take no more than twenty five minutes so we should keep that in mind
there is yeah there is
no problem um okay this new product we are are g are going to develop um
it's a remote control a television remote control um and first of all it should be original it
should be trendy and user friendly those are kind of easy um uh uh
goals um and i'm sure we can find more goals for the for the product we are going to develop
um we will discuss uh later on more ideas about uh how the remote should
look and how it sh it should function and all those kind of things the market we should have a look at the market
um we are going to use a a pred a project method uh during
uh this development um which consists of three different design stages
uh the functional design the conceptual design and the detailed design um
all of these stages um um mean that we do some individual
work prepare and then uh meet to discuss our uh uh
the the the progressions yes um the first stage
the functional design um we are going to search for the user requirements
and we will um make a specific uh specification of that
um the second is the technical functional design um what
effect should the remote have well in this case control t the the television
i think
um and the last one is the working design how exactly does it work in the technical sense
um the other design stages uh we will discuss that later so we'll kop it keep it
with the functional design okay um before we think about remote control we will um
work with some of the tools we have uh here um as you see now i can give a presentation
um it's also possible to use this one as well you can uh uh display pr uh two
presentations if you want to um
to um presentate to show us uh a file you'll need to
uh place it in your project documents folder which is on your desktop at least it should be
um then we have this electronic white board system um
yeah i will show that now um
you can draw on the board using this pen there are little um uh sensors so do not grab it here but a lit more a little bit more to the uh to the end um
well it it's on the um eraser now so we click the pen button
okay so not too fast writing um
you can insert a new um slide or or white board uh uh file
um by either using the insert function or by clicking the next button or the
blank button it's quite the same um all our um whi um
uh smartboard um notes should be kept in the same file so
do not m make a new file just use this one uh during the day um
you can use the eraser to
make something go away
yes
yeah
yeah in the meetings only in the meetings it's really like like a regu regular whiteboard um you can choose the format um sorry uh
let me see
um
well
i guess it's maybe because i'm not s uh pen selected
yep current colour you can choose another colour and um for example
black and you c i can choose the line width um so now i d have a different
line width and uh colour okay quite easy if you uh do have any questions just c ask me
um to um oh well i'm i wrote down the documents uh should be in the project documents
folder if you want to uh discuss it with us um as a little training
um i will ask ruud first to draw uh uh your own animal on a new
slide uh with uh a different colour and a different line width than the one
uh now selected

a rabbit okay well great um roo could you do the same please but a different animal with a different colour and a different line width
sebastian is thinking about the animal
okay
it it should be a cat okay

i'm guessing a horse


yes okay
beautiful
okay so um you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to
um any questions well just just let me know um okay back to our project
um the remote control we are going to develop um will have
a selling price of about twenty five euros uh the profit we are
looking for for this product is fifty million euros
which is quite a number um we uh we will focus this internationally so the product
will be sold um if there is market uh interest uh in in more
than one country and um the production costs should not be more than uh twelve euro fifty
so we should keep that in mind by uh w w during the development um
because uh well those are important numbers um then
the discussion maybe the time for sebastian to show his presentation
limitations
okay
okay great

yeah
okay so the the main por uh the main points you are uh telling us are focus on the inter uh operability and
okay and and uh
okay okay good um that was your presentation okay okay um okay great um
i'll go back to my own presentation um
mm okay um i i do think it's time now to to discuss uh
mm some things um sebastian told us a few things about the technical implemen uh implications
um there are other things like um how to make it trendy which
is i think uh um most uh ru uh ruud's uh role
um the way how it should be controlled by the user which is uh roo
uh r uh during this part um so let's start with you h how do you think
the remote should um function for the user
yep
okay so we're we're going business to consumer not we're we're it's not a
no no
yeah
uh ruud y do you agree okay okay
yeah
so is that ease of use or uh is that more like um
okay
uh huh
maybe not even pointed yeah
okay uh
okay gentlemen um uh just a reminder we d we have five minutes left for this meeting um okay
okay s yeah
yeah
okay

uh i'll write down glow in the dark is tha okay okay um uh
i just want to hear uh ruud's um input for this meeting um do you have anything already
w um ab idea about how the market uh will respond to the such a product or what we should take
um in account when developing such a product
mm hmm
because
mm hmm
okay
okay
okay sebastian did you have any other ideas


okay yeah yeah okay because because we wa we want to develop a trendy product so
yeah twelve euro fifty yeah
okay
okay okay
okay um i ha i have one point f um which which comes in mind now um
uh d i think the device should either be rechargeable very easily
um or it should not consume too much um power because it's very annoying
if you need to change the batteries every s uh uh every other week
so um
maybe we could um for example uh only light the buttons that are um uh applicable at that moment or yeah i dunno it's uh that's more sebastian's uh um
well does it i'm not sure uh
yeah
okay gentlemen i'm afraid we do not have any more time um
so we will go back to our own uh work um next meeting starts in thirty
minutes and um well you know your o your individual actions or your personal coach will probably
email you about th it um so
this was it see you in thirty minutes
good morning flores
marketing expert
right

for the cameras
alright


geez

you have the same message of uh windows cannot um
sen oh stand by close the the window
so
that's right ruud


mm hmm
mm hmm
alright

okay
progressions
it's for the vision yeah
sensors
but we all use the same white board file
so we can work together on it while we're or should we only use it in the in the meetings
yeah okay
yeah alright yep

it's a bunny
but of course flores
blank
yeah i'm think about it too format
well it looked more than a bunny than a cat but it works right


with a very small legs
you should feed that uh that animal


okay
okay
and for a cell phone
yeah okay
yeah
but
yeah but the infrared it's uh well a little bit old fashioned if you would call it like that but all the t v s are uh equipped with infrared so
y you you can
most of them or you shou sh use a you should equip infrared and bluetooth together in one remote
yeah
mm hmm
well i had a few uh things in mind um
well the interoperability just like uh sebastian said um the remote should work on different
t v s or even different uh um
yeah uh what is it devices
um so i i i think it's a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in
uh a store it's not for uh for uh for uh philips or whatever
to buy our remote for their own product right
yeah i do i don't know that it's no i have uh don't have the information for it
no okay
yeah
um
well the techni fu technical function uh what you said is just by pressing the button you should change
the state of the t v  that's just the basic f technical function so that was my really my part
for uh this session um
well that's just the fu the technical function is pure what should the remote control do wh what
is his task uh as an uh as an uh device it just should
change the t v 's state so that's it um but furthermore
yeah yeah with buttons yeah or maybe you want a touch screen or
but
yeah
they're very vu vulnerable
yeah
yeah and for other user interface i had um well it's more industrial thing uh
point at a t v  i think it's it's quite disturbing when you always have to point directly to the t v  so
you must point everywhere so maybe infrared is
yeah just don't even point it so in that case infrared should uh maybe uh be restriction to that
yeah if you g if you go to radio or or yeah for t v  you're always in in the neighbourhood of a t v  so i don't think think
the range should be a problem to that but if you want to uh get it working with a radio and you're in outside your garden with just one uh speaker then maybe the range should be uh
but
yeah
two more things um
you should able to feel the buttons without uh it mis um you have
to know what you do without looking at the buttons so it should be as user interface
um for feeling should be uh good to understand you
must feel the buttons for volume or whatever i think and of
course you don't always know where all buttons are so it should be visible al um in dark too
so when it's dark
those are two really uh user interface
yeah that's perfect

yeah
yeah well maybe i um but it it can be quite simple you can just have white buttons
with a black mark on it the uh the the digits in black uh then it's already visible
in dark so it it don't have to be a lightning or or a fancy well it can be for design of
course
just remind something the digits of uh the the painting on the buttons should not fade you have a m uh
always have s the soft buttons always uh
clear the the the paint on it the marks
yeah
but um
necessary yeah
yeah but then bluetooth uh might be problem 'cause i think bluetooth uh
yeah i know it from the cell phone
but you can't you can't use bluetooth all the time twenty four hours a day does it
it's over
okay
great
good morning mister p m  how are you today how was your business trip to boston
is there a schedule for this meeting
i shall close the door
that's correct
okay um is there any room for a little presentation uh maybe during the discussion uh section
okay


alright
i'm just uh guessing what should be my favourite animal
well i'll give it a try
mm
very good

i was very good in drawing

well i guess you uh get the idea
beautiful

yes um i have some technical uh issues which i would like to present to you uh before we start the discussion because uh there might be some uh influations influences okay
okay
um first about my role role of the industrial designer i would like to think
about uh the implementation of uh of things and the technical possibilities and
impossibilities so if someone of you comes up with uh ideas uh i'll try to translate
them in technical functions but uh there might be some impossibilities
so that's one uh i also will propose some uh um
uh some implementations for that but well these are quite the same sorry about
that um and i also will remind people of some new technical possibilities
which are available and which might be interesting to implement in our product
i have some uh initial ideas about some things um which are maybe nice
to take with you in the upcoming uh discussion one thing about uh interopera operability
um i think a modern uh remote control should
uh control a device diverse subset of equipment uh for instance uh d v d  players
cell phones video and audio equipment so one re uh one remote control for all your
equipment
well there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them
i think it could come in handy we should discuss that um and we should think about the way how these things uh should communicate with each other we're not uh living in the uh nineteen eighties anymore so infrared is not uh
is not really uh hot uh technical stuff anymore but you should uh think about the things like uh bluetooth
mm hmm
but it's cost effective
yes
mm hmm well not all not all so that's the point so
maybe but that's uh something we should discuss and uh about every everybody should think about
it so that's just my role i'll just uh give you uh everybody some technical input and i think now
the time is to have a little discussion about what uh the product should be and how it should look but
take these things into account when you start the discussion
yes so one thing uh one remote control should uh control one or more uh pieces of equipment and the way of communicating with these equipments
okay
that's it

yes i think it should be something like that
we're not developing this product for a specific vendor are we no we're just developing this product and we want to sell it to a very broad uh public so it should fit to every device
yeah

mm hmm
and you you see uh the buttons as a as a means of doing this or are there any o other controls are there only any other cont
well i i've seen these remote controls with uh this little stick uh which you can move forward
sidewords you know these things and um it's very easy for a user to to switch w yes
to to switch b uh between uh channels or uh change uh between tracks on a on a c d  on on a
chapters you know on a d v d  player so maybe that's an idea i don't know
mm hmm
okay
mm hmm uh is that uh are there restriction for the range the operating range too so when you're not able to point at the device um the range is very limited
mm hmm mm hmm
mm hmm
okay
okay

okay do do you
um well yes i had uh about three minutes ago but i've seem to forget them forgot them um oh yes i remember um you said something about visibility in the dark um
uh would it be nice for a user to have display on this uh remote control on which you can see functions
which makes it easier to operate it
i i don't know
mm hmm
okay
mm hmm
okay
okay
yes but there's a cost limitation too well that's more
so that's a big problem i think i think the the financial part of this project uh implicates that it's not going to be a high high end product the cost price is very low um
okay very good point yeah
okay
mm hmm okay
okay
hmm
it's use uh a lot of uh well well cell phones have uh integrated bluetooth also and well it's it seems to work uh quite okay so uh technically it will be possible
no you cannot
okay
okay

okay
good morning
okay
um green
an animal okay um
uh a wee rabbit


yeah


yeah i think i think they're right yeah
uh i think most most things have already been said like uh control multiple devices
and uh yeah infrared might be an issue
uh well he said about n abo what he said about pointing but uh lots of devices already use infrared so
we'll probably have to implement that
yeah

i'm proud of it



uh huh how how much do we have forty minutes yeah
okay so
presentation
okay okay so um basically going with
our trend of vegetables and we selected the colour and approximate shape of banana
um

yeah um
yeah
um so basically it's the it's the flip open thing again so now we
we have the okay so ma maarika will explain you the user interface there and it flips open on the
side so it opens like that and we have the user interface
o in here and uh the the l c d  and and the scroll are inside um
well everything else is probably user interface so yeah yeah
oh yeah yeah it has yeah
yeah well but i since it's made of rubber anyway i i think it's it's uh
yeah
mm hmm


it's on the side
uh no we we'd not put so on on the cover we have the the bare essentials
uh on the l c d  we r you know the main menu will have various options
mm
mm
yeah it's hidden in there somewhere
cool
we ran out of resources here so
you can have a look




yeah see the budget




i guess we'll give it maximum points in everything

so
yes
okay
but we can we can i can i can take note uh uh

um the the only thing that we were considering was that uh this thing is kind of more for right handed people than for left handed people so if you're left handed you're kind of left uh scrolling with your finger
but then yeah
yeah so bu it's it's not a huge problem because i i it is operatable
right
yeah
yep
mm
mm
one more thing is that i
it might be a little clumsy when when it opens up right so it opens on the side so
yeah yeah yeah i mean yeah so you guys can decide wh whether
oops
yeah but we which makes it kind of really big yeah
uh this this kind of uh makes it more and two it might interfere with the i r  channel
okay
right
okay
no we have a locator
yeah
yeah
intuitive completely intuitive
intuitive
and uh even the scroll it's a it's a new technology so m m might be a little more difficult for people to get used to in the beginni so it is kind of not very intuitive but uh it's a good technology i mean once they get used to it
yeah
so l
yeah okay i'm gonna give a seven in everything so
mm
yeah yeah unless you are a all the time sitting
yeah
yeah i i think it is ergonomic
mm yeah
and moreover it it has um l c d  and everything so that uh you know uh we minimise the pressing of the buttons anyway
absolutely
so it has voice control
yep

anyway it ha yeah it's the most sophisticated remote that i ever seen
yeah but they've been brought together in a remote
yeah



absolutely the carrot banana remote

i think that's a
yeah
there are how many sixes one two three three
and one five
okay twenty eight thirty eight fo forty six forty six and five fifty one fifty one divided by

mm i guess it'll have to wait for a bit

mm
advanced yeah
yep
mm anything uh i think which is not more
yeah
mm
no uh we we have uh yeah
mm no
we don't have we're not using any of that
huh wh wh what is the limit uh
mm i don't think so no no it says what what is the kind of interface if
it is pushbutton then you got a zero point five it's a scroll wheel so we we've put it's pushbutton
and scroll wheel and l c d  display so that's that's the three kind of interfaces
that we have
wh wh what's our criteria
uh okay
uh it does not have for voice recognition but it does have for the feedback speaker when you say when you press one it says one or it says hello
mm and the locator also goes away
a also i in the case i'm not sure that you will evaluate this as a curved surface because it's just rubber so it's probably a flat surface rubber uh i mean uh um yeah
um
so tha that mean that we cannot press how do we how do we make a selection in uh in the l c d  if in the l c d  we can scroll right but how do we make a selection if we d cannot push the button
no w w w but ha it's it's the scroll wheel and i thought we were referring to this as a scroll spinning wheel and pushbutton thing
that comes with the l c d 
oh so so the the this is
so we're adding costs for right okay uh i mean i think this is good
instead of scrolling here we have two buttons here up for up and down on the side mm uh it sounds good actually yeah

we have yeah
not really no because we keep all the features we keep voice recognition we keep l c d  display we instead of having scrolling we we just push the buttons um yeah
yeah
but we lose the locator
so instead of speaker
'kay






i think it mm

i think uh n one thing that was lacking uh was that we did not know what the various things cost to begin with um we kap kept a adding things randomly so had we known
yeah that or not yeah
yeah so d all the random decisions at the end could have been prevented
mm
yeah mm



yeah yeah yeah that's it's it's i wonder what one of these costs

yeah
mm yeah

yeah

yeah
mm i guess it was a fairly small group so all of us got to express our opinions yeah
mm

hmm

yeah


mm hmm
i thought that was good though because if you're given too much time then you got nothing to do with your time and um yeah although we could have made the r s better had we had five more minute
we certainly are mm yeah

yeah same here
mm uh no i don't think so

was there a questionnaire already sent

it does look very cool
and then do we get to make a remote control
yeah
yeah
you think bananas are a safe thing to use it's a bit um phallic
oh your remote control oh that's just bad
is it to scale or do you think you can make it a bit smaller
yeah
it l does look like the curvy and then the whole shape's curvy so i would say that this curvy does look quite like a vegetable
i wasn't very keen on that but yeah
so where's the volume
ah you did get that in then mm hmm
oh okay
cool oh the thing we forgot was like a mute button
yeah
on the wheel like if you hold the wheel down then it will mute
yeah but it's a scroll and click isn't it
okay cool so that that solves the whole mute issue
yeah

yeah oh we hold the remote oh but it it does feel all cold and slimy i hate play do it's just minging but yeah uh that's cool cool
mm hmm
okay
wales
mm cool okay right okay
fabulous yeah okay cool so what we're gonna do is prefer
prepare the evaluation of the new design um so we're gonna be using a seven point scale so one is
you know yes it totally meets with that requirement and seven is no it really doesn't we need to go back and start again
um you know
basically what i did was i went through all the like user requirements and things that we've done
and we've worked on and like made a list of them um you know so that we can evaluate each one
and like so it was about going back to the start and saying oh yeah we did manage to do that or oh no we really forgot about that okay
cool so these are what they are oh
yes i did have a  b  c  and d  down here but it seems to have turned into like just bullet points okay but if you can imagine that they say a  b  c  and d  then that would be really good
well i thought we'd um kinda said that you'd have a little thing to stick on the t v 
yeah
cool okay so be attractive to look at
that's this one what do you all say
yeah
oh we're all so proud of the okay so that'll be a seven for a  could oh no you can't whilst that's up there okay um uh what i've done on the next page is i've set it up so we just put the marks in
yeah but that's alright if you take a note of them and then i'll put them in in a minute okay so we're all agreeing on seven for a  cool okay does it match the operating behaviour of the user
yeah i mean
yeah
i th i think it's not it's not like it's a pen
yeah but i mean because it's not like it's a pen you know left handed people can't normally write right handed but they can normally do most things right handed so i would say it's not such a big issue
yeah i mean you can you can use your finger to to scroll rather than your thumb so
i mean that does kind of negate the whole r s i  issue so maybe we need to put that needs a little bit of investigation
maybe give it a five i would say what do you what do you all think
okay
yeah yeah
i th i think the alternative is flipping from the top
yeah um
but you were thinking about making it smaller yeah
because
so you have to keep that side flat
so it works like a mobile phone flipping but y you know as long as that side's flat than that will work
okay um okay so c 
are are we admitting defeat on c  or are we saying we're gonna stick a locator on the t v 
there's a locator cool so that means you need a that does mean you need a little speaker on it though doesn't it
to make it beep or a buzzer
okay
so that's two so that's seven yeah it's locatable fabulous d 

yeah
yeah and i mean d
so should we maybe say f a five and say it is intuitive but it's different so do you know i mean it's obvious how to use it but you might have to think about it first so we give that one a five you think yep
i'm glad you're accepting this it has taken a little while hasn't it um intuitive
but
sorry it's really hard to write on those i just went a bit mad didn't i um okay cool e  okay
um i would guess this comes back from this whole b  thing links in here so possibly for left handed
investigate
so should we give it a six six

i used to send fifty texts a day you know and i never got repetitive strain injury from that so i find it quite hard to believe to be honest
okay so we give that a six yeah okay f 
hang on how come it's showing up with the things there but it only had bullet points there that's just
oh okay cool um right so
yes so that's a seven then um cool

yeah but i mean you don't
they're never been used i they've never been using remote remote control before i don't think
yeah what do you all think six
well that's it i mean
yeah but i mean everything has been used in space before it gets to anyone else really hasn't it so i don't think many peop
that's it they can take it with them
so we give it seven and we write
there we go
cool so we need the average here so we got
seven
so we've got four sevens so that's twenty eight three sixes eighteen
two three four
seven eight
okay that's pretty good i think


um no that's it yeah
cool there we go
there we go and there are the marks

yeah
yeah but rubber comes coloured doesn't it you know
yeah you might end up having to take off the
sample sensor
no
we've got more than one pushbutton though haven't we
'cause then you have
that means you can only have twenty five push buttons in total doesn't it not counting anything we'd still be in budget
twelve point five
no well it doesn't but it uh
and l c  display
this sample sensor
yeah the sample sensor will have to go 'cause that's the most expensive thing on there
yeah
but that's a bit of a gimmick anyway really isn't it we can afford to get rid of it
so that means no locator does it
i mean does
yeah
yeah
okay yeah
see i was gonna say the scroll wheel pushbutton thing 'cause
but that's well you would just have to to spin it down
so that's point three
yeah i mean that wouldn't actually cost any more that's the spin wheel though isn't it didn't that come with the l c 
yeah
yeah
s so we're point three over
unless we just take off the scroll wheel altogether and just have pushbuttons for the volume
could b still put them on the side
but yeah i mean the scroll wheel's pretty cool but
yeah
yeah
yeah well we could admit to the single curve couldn't we
yeah but
yeah
yeah
no no i don't think so
yeah
we just got rid of a gimmick that was never anyway and the scroll wheel is i mean essentially the two buttons that was it's not a great difference i don't think
really
cool
that's not a very exciting colour i think you should make it more vegetable like
oh the the beeper thing
it
yeah i think jen wants it to vibrate
you know your pen vibrates yeah

cool
yeah
if we'd had that sheet at the beginning should've been like okay so we can have that lot let's just throw it together and do what we can
yeah
i think 'cause the meetings were so regular you know it wasn't like we were alone for very long so you didn't st go off
and think wouldn't it be great to have a vibrating remote control shaped like
a banana and then you know come back three days later and jen's going look look it vibrates and it looks like a
banana um yeah so yeah
uh i like the pens i want one that would just be so cool to d do all your notes and s
i don't think you should say that was the recording okay cover up the microphone alright let's take it okay
it is a bit limiting isn't it yeah
yeah
the thing flew in you didn't have the whole whooshing thing 'cause there wasn't time for that so yeah
not that you can do that on the board either we could make some little
yeah totally i mean that was fairly tight anyway i mean especially with that last minute alteration back it this is just had to be changed and yeah so cool
are we supposed to say nice things about jen now

yeah definitely you weren't like a a dictating leader so that was always good
i know you've got the pen you might attack me with it
yeah
yeah
i don't know i don't go shopping for remote controls that often maybe somebody's already though of it
yeah
yeah
i'll be looking out next time i need to write an essay that looks boring i'll see if anyone's made a remote control
yeah yeah
i think we'd like to think the ideas were new but we've got no way of finding out
that vibrates
yeah but that would just come up with like other things really wouldn't it
yes
and it's fabulous
it's in the project documents
yeah yeah sometimes it's like a little bit rushed


yeah we've got like five minutes left
yeah
'kay

we could draw animals on the board again

i don't like play doh no it's just minging it smells so bad
it does
mm
no it hasn't been
do we have to go back into the other room or can we stay in here now
okay so the other way

okay this is our final meeting the detailed design meeting
and again i'll take minutes the what we have to get through in
this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two so you can show us what
you've been working on so diligently
um then
then cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be
evaluating this against then i need to say some st a few things about finance 'cause we have to check that
it's within the finance criteria um and then we'll be
making sure that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from cat and the financial
limits um and then we uh will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of
production and design that we've been through so we've got forty minutes s
'cause we missed out
so
it's now i guess that we're supposed to start at fifteen thirty five so we've got until four
fifteen
is that right
yeah until about four fifteen so yeah
go for it do you want
yes



dual use perfect dual use perfect does it vibrate when you press the buttons sorry sorry
mm hmm
mm hmm
wow
and it's the whole thing's made of rubber is that
mm hmm
yeah

huh
mm hmm
yeah
six seven eight nine i like that
yeah
uh huh
yeah
mm hmm
yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
y or you could have it so you on the wheel if you
but if you hold it in if it's a scroll and click so you hold it in
no
mm hmm very good
and it's with the the black and yellow you're even in the right colours
mm hmm

very good let's have a look test it out

uh it's a sort of intermediate colour i guess

very good okay so maybe if we go on to evaluation cri criteria and then we'll there i suspect we're gonna have a couple of minor finance issues but um we'll se i'm sure we can get around them somehow
we'll just send all of our manufacturing to
some nice poor country and
cut some of the prices that way
wales for example
marketing expert
mm hmm
mm hmm
so for each of these we need to give it a one to seven is that right
mm dots never mind
yeah i agree
yeah just prepare one now
i reckon it
yeah
seven yeah it's terribly sexy yeah
ah okay
excellent except we can't uh we can if we then yeah i'll take a note it's fine
yeah
i think it does
alright
but that's gonna be a problem 'cause you don't always have all left handers or all right handers in a family
yeah
yeah
mm hmm
yeah
mm hmm
yeah
um
six
yeah i think i think for um i mean most people are right handed so in in terms of our greatest target group i think it's pretty good but we might want to flag it for management they want might want to um
they
mm hmm
yeah
the length is gonna be difficu
mm
no we're gonna put it like we've got th there's the locator dot
mm
yeah

yeah
i'd say six 'cause the i mean the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one rather than the way you've got it i really like the way you have it but it's not the immediate thing that you're used to
so
might be
but it and it's something that they will be experiencing in a lot of different places soon
five
yeah
i'm happy with five yeah

yep but otherwise it's superb
six
yeah
well we've banned them from

yeah
yeah it's varied
yeah six
voice control have seven
ah that's the second one so you must have changed it on this one where it's got score but not on the previous slide
g  technologically innovative
but in terms of the actual technology none of it is actually new
yeah
all of the components have been used in other things before but do yeah yeah
yeah what do you reckon five six
yeah

space remote
put fashion in electronics



very good
yeah one
or a seven
fifty one one two three four five six seven eight
six point point about six point five close enough
now wait until we get to finance and then we'll see if we can afford it
that's all you've got at the moment or did you have anything more
that's it alright so finance
and we'll see if we can
unscrew this first
sorry this is i'm just um
beautiful not anymore
computer no signal
adjusting
there we go
okay so we've looked at the prototype presentation and the evaluation criteria
and now we have to calculate the production costs so i've got an excel spreadsheet to help us do that
can you read that almost
more or less um i started filling it in but
of course these are provisional so we have to go down no hand dynamo right one simple battery
no kinetic energy no solar
the chip we're going for an advanced chip on print we also said the sample sensor and sample speaker
um single curved surface so that we can fold it
case material we said rubber i don't know what special colour means

it could be
rub rubber comes coloured it's i would maybe it's like if you want titanium coloured or wood coloured it's different
yeah let's leave it as zero 'cause it's easy
we we're definitely going to have to so we've got pushbutton and then we've
scroll wheel with pushbutton we had no s for the muting
yeah
and button supplements
no
no
but the the spinning wheel's not there i have think maybe it's integrated with the l c  display

i think the pushbutton oh
i don't know if that's one
yeah
that seems unlikely
push what uh whether whether pushbutton means that p count by button or do we i don't think that makes sense
no
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
so as we can see that's way too expensive down here
our budget's twelve point five
yeah so that has implications though for the
for the locator
yeah
yeah
what else does it need
yeah 'cause the sample speaker was i think more complicated then just a beeping thing
yeah okay so we
uh huh
right so we need one fifty off
take it down to just a scroll wheel
we could do
yeah
you can have to scroll it straight r roll it straight down for for mute
that's with the l c 
we decided 'cause it's not on our list
the scroll wheel is on the side
we're point three over at the moment
it's nothing n
yeah i have
yeah
rather than having three different things that people have to do
there we go oh look we're way under budget and we'll make huge profits and we'll all get bonuses
or or that we have to have some sort of special colour
so that's alright we we'll leave it at that and then i'll take i can send it back to management and say we weren't quite sure
about the colour if that costs extra then we've still got some space for it yeah excellent
alright so did we lose um on our evaluation criteria
as a result of doing that
mm
yeah
yeah
yeah alright then
we're gonna have a beep
yeah
yeah
tha
'cause we we won't have run out of our pot of play doh
yeah i know i know my pen vibrates but only for a very short time um
okay
so
looks like we've designed a
banana well done team um we need we've just got
about ten minutes or so left of the meeting so it would be good if we could just have a little talk
about the project itself and how it went um so that we can feed back
to the management for next time they're designing a product
feedback ideas
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah
mm hmm
but in terms of the process of um going and working individually and then coming back to a meeting that that worked in terms of
mm hmm
mm hmm banana

mm hmm the whiteboard digital pens we like the pens
yeah you could take it to lectures and just write stuff down and have it printed out when you got back to the office they great
do you think they'd notice if one went
oh okay
yep shh yep but that worked well having having a whiteboard that we
could draw on as well as having the powerpoint 'cause the i find that the problem with powerpoint often is that it's
so static and you can't change it once you're in there yep
mm hmm
yeah that's alright that always irritates me anyway yeah
mm
yeah
yeah
and presumably you don't you can say nasty things as well
i have no stake in it
you have to say that 'cause i'm taking the notes i'll leave the room and you can have another go
better than that than the banana
i think it worked quite well did anyone feel that they were getting sort of covered up and not being able to
say their bit
yeah
new ideas found not quite sure what about yeah
yeah

mm hmm
yeah that's right


banana remote
yeah or you can always go to google and type in banana remote control flip vibrate and uh yeah
nothing that you really want true yeah
okay so costs are within budget well within budget including a little what have we got one euro left over for bits that we didn't foresee
um we've evaluated
the project you've got the scores can you put that in the project documents file it's in there already
and the process wheel didn't really have any major problems with were there any was
there anything that you found difficult or anything
that didn't go as smoothly as you'd hope
yeah

okay then um i think we're still well within our
time we've got about five minutes left but if we've finished then we've finished we're just too too efficient and you should never drag a meeting on just because you have extra time
so i would say that's the end of that meeting
thank you team it was very productive day and
mm uh no
right so we have to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary when they send it i don't know if it's already sent or not um presumably i have to
i don't see why you can't stay here really

did i save this one production costs
it was supposed to be pink but it was blue on the board

yeah


yeah about four fifteen yeah
so you said um are are we starting with the the so will you maybe start with like
the mm the shape and things and and then i will explain the the user interface th
uh things like the buttons and the scrolling things and

well but it's it's just an a approximation


uh yeah
rubber
yeah
um it could be made a bit smaller and and of course it would be and yeah but um one thing we actually kind of um forgot while designing that one side was supposed to be rounder so we said the back side round yeah
yeah
yeah and it's spongy as well so
so uh the user interface as as we discussed last time uh mm on on the on the
cover we just have the very basic things so we have that n uh channels here starting from um uh one
two three there would be numbers in in the on the actual one so it's four up to four
up to seven up to nine and zero z zero here
yeah and then well this is on off button it's it's quite standard mm place for
it and and also the colour is quite often red so it's it's kind of user friendly and then
these ones would be for flipping the channels back and like the previous one and the next one and and we would also have
a l little um thing saying here previous and ne prevon prevon next
the volume is is scrolling on the side this one yeah you just do it like this and and and it's it's on the back is mm cover or back lid because if you flip it open you can still do the scrolling here
see so the volume is you just scroll but then once you flip it open okay there there you have
the screen and and you have the mm spinning wheel with options to choose you can
move back and forth and then if you need to m choose something on the screen you just push the cen mm the middle button
a mute button
well we'll have this on the screen on the display
well but the but the mute yeah the scrolling is kind of you have to scroll all the way to make it mute right
okay yeah okay
yeah
and okay so i so the the voice recognition is also just part of it you can't really see it in the interface
yeah and we do have the logo on it as well
so i think it
yeah
yeah i think um we could do l the logo in grey as it is on the website
in the actual one
yeah so if you have questions



yeah
yeah the yeah it's definitely attractive
oh the locatable thing we actually forgot
yeah shall i just prepare it now
it will be red too
s seven was th the maximum yeah i i go for seven

i would think yes yeah
yeah so y so we we might do we might want to do like a uh another m model another another version which is like exactly the mirror image of this one
yeah
but then then i think left handed people are already used to discrimination anyway so they just
yeah
yeah because i mean anyway right handed people would be able to scroll with it so i if the majority are right handed it's uh
or maybe six because it's just one one i one among the issues i mean yeah
yeah
no yeah but mm but we have it nicely with the hinges here yeah so it won't be a problem it will be and it will be it won't be heavy
yeah well yeah but it's it's a bit long it's a little bit long well i mean it can be opened like this of course and yeah
s uh slightly smaller
yeah but if we flip it open only as much as that
mm that you stick on t v 
yeah well w but l but the speak sample speaker is included so it it has some capacity to mm to do some to make some sounds so yeah
yep
yeah if uh uh if this means intuitive if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things and it's i th i think it's
yeah
yeah
um uh the ergonom ergonomic design well mm i mean i d uh i dunno
i mean the the repetitive stress things but then who would be really pushing the buttons so much on the
on the remote control anyway yeah see
yeah so it's kinda
yeah
yeah it does have yeah
technologi well
yeah
well mm we have we have the sample speaker as well which is yeah it's kind of new
but at the same time they are all they are all relatively new
six
i mean how how far can you go with a remote control really it still has to do what i what it has to do

yeah isn't it fashionable yeah sure
it's the maximum fashion fruit fruit and vegetables are fashionable these days so
so i think we've done very well but
what's the assessment
the average is about six and something a little bit over six
no wait a little bit under six no wait
oh three sixes okay yeah
four sevens
six point something yeah
six point five yeah
yeah

yeah
yep
yeah yes
rubber
i think something coloured yeah probably so i think this is probably special co no
yeah
or maybe maybe if you want some kind of pattern thing on it yeah yeah okay
yeah
we have pushbuttons
scro we have scroll wheel as well
s yeah yeah we had for muting yeah and we have l c  display and yeah
um
yeah but what do we ha we have l c  display but but the wh but the s spinning wheel
yeah
okay let's yeah
we have to count all of them or yeah
but it was very no innovative innovativeness well um yeah
well the speaker uh the sample speaker is is expensive but we could just have some some very very easy device that just beeps
this would be
yeah yeah yeah there you record your samples your speech samples and
yeah then then we would be in the b budget
yeah b no no you can push this one but we don't have a pushbutton uh we ca we don't have this muting mechanism for this scrolling thing
mm hmm
but i mean we can put an additional mute button on the top as well
if you
mm
so
mm hmm
okay yeah
okay
yeah
well we're going to have a beeping thing but yeah it's it's not like sample speaker but it will just beep so we still have the locate
which colour the the colour of the phone or the colour of the
but it can be yellow as well it can come in the same colour as the the case


yeah mm as far as creativity is concerned yeah i think there was there was room for creativity the only the only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the the budget we had
yeah yeah yeah

yeah
yeah the m the means were very very good the means we used
and the pens
yeah yeah


yeah
yeah and and and this time also the time limits but actually preparing the
yeah
but yeah but i mean already just just preparing the slides before before the meeting yeah
yeah

yeah i was i was satisfied with with the leadership yeah
mm hmm
and then the teamwork i think i think it worked quite quite nicely yeah
to express them mm mm no
well it's it's it's pretty new pretty novel solution for a for a remote control really all this flipping open thing and
yeah neither neither do i but i've never seen anything and and none of my examples were was was like this actually so
yeah maybe w maybe we could have a patent on this one
patent patent patent mm
mm hmm


yes
yes
and my main difficulty was the the time pressure otherwise it's it's all fine
yeah yeah yeah
yeah
yeah
yes
yeah it was a pleasure working with you
you can make some animals oh you don't like anim
it doesn't smells quite nice smells very sweet
i made your animal for you
okay welcome to the second meeting of this uh design group
um
i'll briefly go through the uh
notes of the of the last meeting
uh just done in in note form and i haven't attributed anything to individuals because
we're working strictly as a team here and uh n nobody's working equally
so uh um we we s we saw that the the problems with
existing remote controls were the uh b a boring shape and boring colour
um and and we s we saw that the um what we needed to do was to to make sure the device um controls several items that switching was easy
that you shouldn't need to point the thing at uh anything in particular um
that it need to be contoured to make it interesting that the keys might be
concave simply because that hasn't been done before that we know of um should
have interchangeable fascias so people can personalise it um illuminated so that people can see it in dark
rooms um and that people might want it as as in addition to their existing remote controls
um and that it sh it should just always work whenever you uh um
mm uh use it and that it shouldn't be too small mm that it it gets lost
um

now uh
uh i'll shortly ask for for three three presentations uh before i do that however
i will go through some new project requirements that um the the management have
placed on us and uh will be challenging in terms of what we discussed
at the first meeting um the uh
the ma the management has had it's own thoughts on this and uh the they don't necessarily agree
with with what we uh we thought um and and then we'll as
a result of that we will then talk through the the functions that we see the the device um actually b
carrying out and we have uh forty minutes to do this in and i uh
anyway okay
now the n the new requirements are um the the management
team see that um teletext is no longer of any importance
given the uh the rise of the internet um and and they want it only to cover televisions
um now what is not q quite clear from their directive is whether they mean th they don't
want it to cover teletext or whether they don't want it to cover you know videos
d v d s um satellite boxes which uh i mean
we saw as being fundamental to the uh to the exercise the um
the actual wording of the directive is that it should cover television only
um and on that basis um i i think we
we need to bear that in mind um but possibly uh keep at the backs of our minds
that the reality that people even when they uh no longer they don't look at teletext anymore
they certainly do look at other things um the device has to incorporate the
company logo and colours um the the logo uh
being at b the bottom of the screen there the the the two r s in grey against uh a yellow background
um now this doesn't necessarily mean that we have to give up some of our ideas about making it attractive
to the t to the market but uh do do introduce some some constraints as to how we might do that
um it also has to be simple which to some extent goes along w with the first one and that we've
already said that it must be simple 'cause that's what people want anyway um but they also
want it to be simple to get it to the market quickly which um
mm uh is is is their choice but uh um
we we need to talk that through um
okay so uh
after the meeting it'll be summarised and uh
um notes sent out and uh etcetera okay so we'll
first of all mm have individual reports from everybody um again
i there is no order of precedence here um so i i
i'll leave it up to you to who who who thinks they would like to go go first
p fine
oh sorry you can indeed



oh if you click on the um uh the one that that looks like a projection screen no the one to the right of that that one
mm
mm
gosh must be some telly addicts out there if they get r s i  from their television remote is all i can say
mm right
mm
yeah i must say that um the uh i c can't remember what um f you know phone service i was using the other day but that had sorta speech recognition which worked uh remarkably well so that is indeed a uh
um
a thought and it it cuts out uh
i was was gonna say you can't get a lot of r s i  j just get jaw ache okay sorry

yeah
mm hmm

mm hmm i mean
yeah
mm
hmm hmm
uh
should we actually bite the bullet here if people really don't use those buttons to any extent at
all um remove them altogether we we could actually have
we could actually have a remote control with um
i wonder whether we could get the remote control with no buttons at all if we went for voice recognition given that um the
um now the the age structure we were looking at um i mean w we had usage
by age structure what we didn't have was what proportion of people using remotes were in
those particular age groups now do we know whether they
forty no sorry for forty five to fifty five age group uh to put myself right in the middle of it um u use remote controls to a great extent yes we
that would 've speech recogn right so we're looking at um well again we don't know the relative proportion the relative numbers in the age groups
if we wanted something
different truly different then the buttonless remote control w would be it
but if you just lift it up and say channel one or b b c 

it c well it i can i can see technical problems with that in terms of the you know the sound from the television because if somebody
actually on the television says uh uh you know i t v  and you're watching b b c 
then then it might um change itself so it probably needs to be um possibly actually need
a button on it
just to activate it or or something just to identify that you've lifted
it up and it's use and and then just say oh i don't know a thought and and then
uh i mean that that would certainly be uh truly different
um 'cause uh you know audio settings nought point eight percent i mean if they weren't there
would people miss them

vol volume yes um th w we need to s identify things
that people actually need and and it's a function of frequency and relevance and um i would
say ignoring ig ignoring power for the moment um the channel and volume
and th w w given given that we've been told to ignore teletext uh channel and volume are the only ones
that
uh would appear to be essential
um
so we if we can design something that that looks interesting
know or looks different um incorporates the the logo and and the colours and um we can still have our interchangeable fascias even if it's the yellow and grey um
and uh i dunno buttons or or buttons as an option
do please
mm hmm
you cer certainly could

depe uh i depends whether um if we want to make this
so simple that anybody can walk into the room and lift it up and say
b b c  one um okay i mean you could
print actually print it on the uh
device itself
um
s th this i th that's always gonna be a problem i think um and i i i s so i suppose one um
could make it so desirable that if people lose it they immediately go out and buy another one anyway sorry carry on do you want to just carry on with
or no no no uh b i was in the middle of in the middle of your report there
mm okay

mm hmm
s s we could we could make it dual function voice recognition and still have buttons on it um 'cause we're
certainly could yeah yeah

the i mean the the advantage of doing away the buttons altogether is it makes the thing cheaper
no it cou certainly opens up the possibility for making it uh you know visually very distinctive
um 'cause you know it does not have to be a oblong box
mm yeah
okay who sorry have you have you finished there andy yep yep
um given that we've already had a extensive discussion uh
ah there we go
alright
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm yeah
okay can i um i'm actually gonna use the um it's gonna cause great technical problems over here i'm actually gonna use the
yes rather than the uh the the traditional in fact um i won't even go that far
um something like this shape you know sort
of something that you can that's sort of a more vertical shape um that you you sort of hold
in your hand um well i'm trying to think
uh uh uh l uh l such as i mean um something you hold up like that possibly with a couple of buttons like that but with the the entire top with the you know the uh the infrared or whatever source
uh so that you know it's
flying off in all directions so that uh um uh again the n need to look at the the the technicalities of um
actually achieving that in terms of whether the you know the power requirements of the uh such a source um you know compromise the our our need for uh you know it it being
um mm permanently
uh you know available uh whether whether different technology um i mean th
all all these remotes are presumably infrared and like they have been for a long time uh we we possibly need to be
looking at at at something different um you know short range not like the old uh radio
remote controls where you'd change next door's telly when you change yours um
but uh uh i think basically i if we're going for i if minimum number of buttons is our priority then
we should as i say r know really bite the bullets and and reduce the buttons to absolute minimum
you know possibly with backup channel and volume buttons and on off um and nothing else
um so that it can al it could uh almost end up like that but
again except that um you know the risk of losing it um anyway okay um so kate wh what
are your uh your thoughts on this
okay
uh it seems seems to me there are a number of fundamental decisions to make before we
um i think your point about the the big energy source is uh a very valid one
um i don't suppose we've got any statistics on the the life expectancy of uh
remote controls particularly sort of independent ones um given
you know the number of things you buy these days which you know have a a a lithium whatever battery in that's uh you know
never needs replacing um perhaps we should have the the disposable remote control uh
um you know one some sort of typical usage you know the the the battery will last
know five ten years
by which time i mean when all's said and done the digital television
will be taking over in that time scale um
uh uh p perhaps we should know reduce the uh you know the sort of moving parts even more by not even having a battery compartment and uh
yeah and if if anybody manages to run it down we'll we'll give 'em a new one um it's
you know it's what it saves in cost and you know there there's a well it's actually a marketing
gimmick i mean it's hardly a gimmick it's uh it's totally practical uh so i th think you know the idea of a rechargeable one is
um
uh unless you're really high tech and it sort of just recharges itself if it's n by you know magnetic waves or whatever if if it
yeah are are people really gonna use it though um
i i th i think
yeah it's um i mean i know that somei times my my wife goes out in the morning and says oh i should have put the phone on to charge and then then she's had those for so long that if she hasn't worked that out by now um
when it yeah wh when it's died is a problem yeah yeah yeah so uh um what so wh what what do we think about the um the the permanent mm battery
is the uh you know we we we are really going for the ultimate in ex uh external simplicity here um you know cut cost within the
manufacturing and uh
you know if we have a high tech interior then then that that sh may well be cost effective
i mean th th certainly um i can't think of anything off the s top of my head but there are certainly things that you buy i mean calculators for example

som well some do i mean th th but there are battery ones that um are you know sort of permanently sealed in in fact i'd
yeah uh uh
yeah i i mean th th this needs going t into the technology a bit i mean the the actual time that a remote control is actually operating
i would think is
i is is probably you know no more than minutes in its entire life
um
if but i say if if people are getting r s i  from it then uh then uh then then perhaps we're looking at the wrong market n
right
oh i must admit i hadn't um i'd i'd missed that that does sound excessive
yeah
well that's right and and i i don't i don't even know whether the i don't even know whether the s the signal lasts as long as you actually keep the button pressed or whether it's just a
sorta tenth of a second no matter how long you press it for i don't know i don't actually know um
yeah
mm hmm
mm

right so i've got a message to say five minutes i dunno how long ago that appeared um 'cause we're we're getting um right so i'd i need to sum up very quickly here um we're looking at extreme simplicity
we're looking at a
radically different shape
possibly no buttons at all um but if you can incorporate um
channel change and volume buttons um in into the design then then that's fine
um in the i mean the the role of the of the um the user interface des
designer becomes b you know more important here because you know shape is no longer an
a uh um a serious constraint but we clearly only need th the main buttons although uh if clearly only need the main functions
um i don't see why we shouldn't go for voice recognition um and the the only buttons that i think we need are channel control volume control and on off
um it needs to incorporate the corporate logo uh the the grey and yellow colour scheme and there's no reason why we can't introduce um interchangeable
uh covers um uh d so does that accurately summarise what we've discussed
right
so uh
yeah
we are doing just the television no
i think that's quite clear from the the information that we've been given no
right
oh yeah well th that's one i s that's one i sent you which which was my interpretation of uh of the uh what came down from from head office um
that's that that that that's their uh their view
okay so uh we can all give some thought to that uh for for the next meeting thank you very much indeed




mm
mm
mm
mm

p
well the only problem i can think of with that is if you've got a lot of people that don't wanna be bothered learning how to use new rem remote controls if you just kind of take away everything that they're used to knowing that's gonna be quite a change it might
mm
mm
yeah
yeah
but look at the importance of them the volume settings
yeah
they're not used often but they are quite important when they're used yeah
mm
mm


mm
mm

hmm
oh you have to hit like function and f  something
f  eight
dunno
oh yeah it's going
oh yeah they might be movable oh yeah they're all they're not connected to anything on the table you just leave 'em on and walk around with 'em

mm
mm


yes mm
which one does this plug into
that one

i can't did you could you see it on you screen when it

that's not cool oh well anyways um alright yeah so um i'll just do my presentation on the working design uh
oh there we go
okay um just at the m yeah the whole sort of method of how the remote control works uh the basic function
of the remote control is to send messages to another sh system the the t v  or the d v d  player or whatever um and it does
this uh by well you need to start off you need an energy source and this energy source will feed into an integrated circuit
chip and the circuit chip is the part that actually composes the different messages uh within the remote um
which will then be sent to the uh the television the d v d  to tell that what to do um and you need a user interface
which controls the chip and thus the messages and uh the user interface is that's basically just you kn the s sorta design
of the actual remote which you hold in your hands and what buttons will be on it um
oh shoot okay uh just general
findings uh what we need uh technically speaking for the remote control is some sort of energy source uh
some sort of user interface which i think we've mostly been talking about the user interface and the design of that um a circuit chip
within that to uh control and send the messages and um a sender and receiver
and um oops uh huh
this is just sort of a little schematic diagram of what we're looking for uh this just kinda represents the energy source which feeds into
the circuit chip uh which maybe then we could have that feed into a switch which would send signals f to um
a subcomponent and on to a light bulb between so it'll light up once we start once you start pressing buttons um
also send signals to the um infrared bulb which will be the part that actually what
sends signals to the the television and then you've got your happy little t v  watcher there
and so my personal preferences i i just think we need sorta big uh energy source that won't die out uh
perhaps some sort of rechargeable battery or a battery dock you could place it in so it'd constantly be charged so you wouldn't have to
uh be worrying about it running out of batteries and not changing channels for you uh a wide range uh sender receiver
so that you can hit the buttons from basically anywhere in the room and the channel'll still be changed uh also
definitely a user friendly interface um and i think we've all sort of mentioned adding a a locating device
on it so when it does get stuck under the couch cushions as they inevitably do you can find them easily
and that's pretty much it
mm
mm

mm
just having one that's guaranteed to last five to ten years oh cool
yeah fair enough
mm mm
mm yeah
mm mm
mm
'cause i only remember to charge my cell phone uh when battery dies and that's pretty much yeah yeah when it turns itself off that's when i plug it in yeah
yeah think that's a good idea
mm

they usually have the little light uh source i dunno what the heck they're called the but yeah the little cells that
yeah
mm
most of them don't they have sort of a combination of the two like when there is light they'll work off the light and if there isn't they'll kick into this battery so we
can maybe do something like that whereas there is a battery but if there's enough light then it's using the light so that it's not actually
draining the battery all the time but you will have the battery there for when you need it
mm
mm
oh it depend if it's uh depends who who's using it who's just sitting there clicking clicking clicking clicking yeah yeah then they're clicking a lot yeah
yeah yeah
yeah yeah
mm
mm

yep hmm
mm
mm
yeah
okay

cool
sorry


it could be oh uh i was just gonna say uh maybe like the flip phones that they
use have you seen the new mo mobile phones that flip out and they have the like texting and then the numbers on one side so
you could have the most used buttons on top and flip it out or something
yeah
that might be the
maybe i
yeah have a big kind of like the satellite box or the cable box and have it just go on the t v  and then it doesn't matter where in the room you are you won't lose it
no
oh
yeah that's true
yeah


okay well i can do mine
yeah let's see if i can make this work um
oh
is it doing
okay
oh okay
okay so this is just about the technical functions so the method i looked online
for examples of other similar products and then just kind of was trying to brainstorm some possible design ideas
and um identify what the necessary things are what people are what you really wanna
have a remote control do um and then there are two different kinds that i found there's a user centred one
and an engineering centred one which i will have pictures of and then we kinda have to decide which one this should be
so these are the two different ones this one um this is
the user centred it has uh quite a few mm uh um fewer buttons and
then this is the engineering centred which has a lot more buttons and probably this
is one that people complain about about having too many buttons that you don't use so
basically what a remote control is is you it's to send messages to the television set you
know turn on off switch the channels and the volume and things such as that and so for this
product it's gonna be television only and then it has to have the uh logos
for the company and the colours and so for my personal preferences i think this one is easier to
use and has quite a you know fewer buttons um we want something that sends
messages easily to the television and i was kind of wondering about this example that they have it looks kind
of narrow at the top and i was thinking maybe if it were wider at the top then that would be easier
um and so we have to decide what's gonna make our product different e the unique style
maybe have it light up so it's visible in the dark um the changeable face plates and the lighting up and visible
i was when we were talking about havi losing it maybe to have a button on the television that you press and it maybe
if it makes a noise or lights up or something like that so it's easier to find if someone has hidden under the couch
or something like that
so that's my presentation
yeah
f they probably clip to you

oh
hmm i think it's all there
h
oh yeah that's kind of strange


yeah people are pro i would think that people might forget i mean people forget to put their cordless phones back on there so
yeah

no
um
do they make batteries that last that long
yeah they have that little solar
yeah
mm
yeah some people are
yeah yeah
per hour
wow that's a lot

yeah
though i think with digital t v  like i know on my cable box you're not supposed to do that because the channel can't keep up with it if you just press it like that so you're supposed to use the menu and go through the different
channels that way instead of
uh oh
yeah
um
oh i just have one question so are we doing just the television or are we doing so not d v d  players we okay okay
okay
yeah
oh okay
okay

uh i don't mind
uh can i steal the cable
cheers
i got a how do i start there
that one cool well these are functionality requirements from the our our
guys down in the the research lab took hundred people and
covered all the aspects of what um is needed by people and what they want to see
um everything kinda from functionality and how individual functions
are how mu how how often they're used and how much their necessary and stuff and general opinions about current current
remotes see that as we kinda noticed seventy
five percent of people find their remote controls ugly
so some kind of a new style should be incorporated that's less ugly uh along with um looking less ugly if it looks better eighty percent of people said they'd spend more money on it
which is a a plus for us if we can make it look better it'd be uh
more cost effective
and we can put the price up
current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user i can empl i kinda take that to mean as um

they
they don't uh they yeah they only use they only work for the television or yeah like as in in my flat i've got six
remote controls for a stereo system a digital box a d v d  player a video player and t v  if it was
uh i mean th my behaviour is to use multiple things at the same time and multiple remotes aren't
really matched well to my behaviour
uh again seventy five percent is seventy five percent of users say they zap a lot i took to mean that they just they use it a lot they use it regularly rather than standing up and
manually change channels or volume
and uh
yeah uh i think the big issue is fifty percent users only use ten percent of the buttons 'cause
uh wh if we got a remote that like well we'll have some buttons taken off by the lack of teletext but
uh oh and we're going to see uh on the uh that some of the functions like audio settings
aren't h hardly ever used and used very aren't considered relevant by the user so i think maybe fewer buttons
which also make the design look sleeker i dunno
uh um yeah and
uh frustrations of like people losing remote control i dunno maybe some kind of system of you press a button on the t v  or maybe that's b it would have to incorporate but like some kind of system where you can f use something else to find the remote control
maybe like it'll beep or something
and um yep the uh time taken to learn new remote controls is
uh don't want to make it too complicated easy to use for uh new like first time users and stuff
and uh repetitive strain injury i suppose we should make it more comfortable and make ma possibly even use have to make it yeah fewer buttons like i was saying about the whole mice the mouse idea of it feels more comfortable maybe don't even have to hold it as such

but uh yeah it also asked um if we would if people would pay more for speech recognition and younger people say they would
and uh there was another section on our on the report for uh l c d  displays but the data wasn't there so i don't actually know what the results for that were so may be incrementally emitting but yeah
and uh it would cut out the r s i  as well if you
yeah um oh yeah so possibly the speech recognition is possibly something could add into the design oh i've got some other things i couldn't fit onto this presentation
um
you see this okay almost no it's sorry it's a bit i'll read out to you uh functionality uh like people's opinions on functionality the relevance to the remote and how often they're used so um
like the power using the using the d swi the power switch to switch on t v  is a high relevance of nine but it's not frequently
used you see what i mean whereas channel selection which is very high relevance is used the
most so m we can maybe even start to cut down on or i was possibly even thinking of
a design that maybe some of the buttons are hidden from everyday use maybe like uh a folding ledge or something
so that we can maybe go into the channel settings and the audio settings which are low relevance and rarely
used and keep the v volume selection and channel selection very easily
oh yeah
yeah like the one that like slides back and the buttons are concealed underneath
just remove them completely
uh yeah

um no this is for pay more for speech recognition
yeah that's true
or even i mean you could even just have it left on you could just put it down once on top your t v  and never have to
yeah
b b c  one

oh yeah
mm mm
relevance of two out of ten yeah
yeah
stand out
uh i just had a thought actually sorry to interrupt uh you were saying about um it could technical problems of like uh someone on the television saying a channel number and it changed we could maybe have like an activation
word
'cause i've seen i've seen this used on computers before where you just you address the remote you address the computer and then give it a command
oh i see oh yeah i see
mm hmm yeah
i mean i'm just thinking of the point of view of peop you could still like lose this remote
mm

oh no i i interrupted you sorry
oh okay
um well i was just kinda wrapping up there yeah i was thinking um yeah maybe such things are relevant we could make things much more f i think the the eighty percent of people would spend more on uh a remote uh that looks better
combined with uh decrease the or take out the limited functio functions that we don't
really use much alright take out teletext but as for channel settings and stuff
it might it might um turn people somewhe peop some people that want the whole functionality away
but since if we're marketing a more kind of fashionable approach then it'd it would be fashion and
fashion over practicality
oh we could yeah
we c yeah we could even have it as like a yeah the buttons control this and the voice functions control the f things that you would do all the time so
so uh yeah if we could uh power on and channel selection and and volume selection wouldn't have to really
yeah and probably it would look better as well
yeah yeah
lined with numbered buttons and
uh yeah yeah that's everything

do you want the cable
f  eight
uh give it about twenty seconds or so

yeah


hmm
mm hmm
it could have like uh know like a cordless phone in your house it s got like a base that sits there all the time
i suppose yeah

yeah


uh that sounds pretty good yeah
mm hmm

w like like this um this uh market research thing says number of times per hour that it's used channel selection a hundred and sixty eight
times per hour
yeah
but then again if you think it of the amount of you know amount of use it's like
that's it's less than a second um
yeah
mm hmm
yeah
yeah like in the email of television only in fact they're in the constraints email that i got
didn't you mention the teletext just television only
oh okay oh yeah


okay everyone's ready
so we are here for uh for uh functional design
okay so we are here for the functional design meeting mm so first i will show the agenda so
we will uh i will take notes during this meeting so
i will try to summarise it and put that summary in the shared folder if you want to look at it afterwards
so then uh each of you will uh lead a presentation on the task that has been required last time so user requirement specification technical function design and working design
then i will uh present you some new project requirements i received from uh the management board
then we will take uh the decision on on the remote control uh needed functions
and then i will assign you the task for the next part
of the meeting of the of the process so uh
who want to start the the presentation of what they did
you can start

you have uh powerpoint
ah yeah maybe there okay who are you

ouch
and
we have a technical problem uh
you put it on
yeah
you have no
over
okay
there's no
we have a technical problem
if you remember yeah but that's
yeah
yeah
okay
okay so special navigation linear access random access and there's a fourth one no
so the better now for special navigation
okay then linear access then random access
ah yeah parameter okay
okay
okay
okay and and voice command did you uh
okay
okay
okay
so that's uh that close your investigations
okay
okay maybe we can have a look at the user requirements with
i dunno if i can open it maybe you can s
it's
messenger no
in which folder
short cut to ami shared folder
maybe you can send it to me by email
just to participant one
at ami
i will try to show it to everyone that would be more comfortable
you send it
yeah
uh this is this email
okay
so maybe i can switch slides when you whenever you ask that will be more convenient so okay functional requirements
mm
yeah

we can just keep doing that
yeah
okay
okay
okay
okay so fewer buttons maybe would be good
okay
yeah
yeah but in fact we it it seems that we are going to make a t v  remote control according to new requirements i received from the management bo i will present them in the following okay
yeah
to find it yeah
yeah
okay
what is her other side

oh yeah i did not knew that
okay so you we have to make it uh more ergonomic yeah
it's your job oh
uh sorry got a message from microsoft
yeah
yeah yeah
yeah
okay
yeah
okay
yeah
this function should be very uh accessible yeah okay this is the main function okay
yeah
yeah
yeah

to have l c d  and voice
okay
yeah maybe this this is important moreover th maybe those uh like those
teenager customer could advice their parents to buy this equipment and
so we can we have to take care of that point of view i think or so
yeah
okay
yeah
okay
okay these are the user requi

yeah
no no no we w it seems that we no want to have a t v  remote control from the management board i receive an email cos it would be costly
uh and and also it it would take more time to develop to have a a general generic remote control
that it would be too long to develop
oh yeah because i received that email from management board and they seems to tell that that
if we want to be on the market as early as possible we should uh focus
on t v  more where it seems that the market is more important
so maybe it's a good decision i dunno what's your opinion


okay
maybe you can go to the whiteboard if you have some drawings to do i don't know



okay are you okay
u c  is the central unit
okay yeah
computation
okay
okay
okay so this is quite easy there is not that much constraints
to have a you s you speak about with voi voice control
standard button one
so do you have any idea of how long it would take to have voice recognition now

okay so i it's a bit long yeah
one month for the standard one with button even if we have a l c d  display
okay yeah
okay so we can take this into account so who think it would be good to go for uh like speech recognition
yeah it will
euros yeah yeah
well each unit is is sell uh twenty five euros
because we are
it seems that that we want to sell like four million units from the first meeting
okay maybe we can uh we can look at the new requirement i receive from the management board and discus discuss all function we want to have
yeah i i will continue well ask your question if you want
okay it's not intuitive first
yeah
but but also it seems that
yeah
yeah
yeah maybe it would be more complex to configure it to be simple than creating a simple product
yeah but also we we see that that most people find it find
remote controls too complex because they have too many buttons and they mainly use only channels and
volume buttons so we may just uh make a very easy to
use remote control with mainly those buttons and maybe also um
some lightning stuff too
because most people find also hard to to find the remote control
losed lose it etcetera
these these are these two points are the main frustrations so maybe if we design something very simple and easy to uh find when lost it will uh add uh a serious competitive advantage
without making something too complex and too long to develop
so but le let us see first the new requirement so we don't have to so this
this uh is uh is um in the this
is in the same direction as we were speaking so we don't have to make a very complex remote controls
to access teletext and stuff like that
yeah but then you have to you have to define the buttons to surf amongst pages and stuff
yeah
so well
yeah so anyway we don't have to include this feature because it's it's not used any more by users they prefer to s
yeah i dunno if i one button is still one more button if if if we want to make it very simple we have to reduce number of buttons compared to th to our competitors
well anyway i have this point we can discuss also um
so as as i told before uh it would be better if it's only
for the t v  um
because we want to be quick on on the market
and then also we have to make very uh uh clear that this uh
this remote control is is part of of our products and show our corporate uh logo
and and colours on the on the design as well so that uh they identify
it as one of our product
so this is the the key point
so before uh finishing we can uh define uh
what would be the characteristic of the o th of the control of the remote control
and which button do we need which function do we want etcetera

so
do you um so so from from the the marketing expert i think
a key aspect is the easy to use aspect it should be very simple
and most button are never used only ten per cent of the button are are used often
so i think we have to do something very simple and i think we all agree on that point no
yeah okay so yeah the key point here is simple
maybe so few buttons channel
volume control
and what el what function do you see
in addition to that
yeah maybe switch t v  on and off

yeah yeah volume maybe a mute button and then on off button
and that's all
mm
okay yeah this is cool maybe we can include that also previous previous channel button
so we have like channel button the previous channel button the volume button plus a mute
button and uh just the the traditional on off button
yeah i i talk about that yeah
yeah incremental definitely because zapping you you switch them
we go faster
mm
maybe we should have also a digit button

yeah
maybe we have also to have digits or only incremental i dunno bec because if you have the
uh
yeah because you have your previous channel button if you have incremental only it's not uh
it isn't worth it because the previous channel is eith either minus one or plus one
so i think we need also digits maybe we we can make very obvious
the channel and volume button button and smaller button down there with the the
digits
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah maybe we can have a wheel for incremental okay so have a wheel for incremental have the digits uh on the lower side that can be closed so as you say protected
and uh yeah i think this is the basi
and do we do we have a
no a wheel is better i would say the wheel is better what is the expert of uh
okay yeah that's a good idea
well also we have to decide uh so it should be lightening in the dark i think because most people lost their remote control
okay
yeah and do we put an l c d  display because it was important for young customers if you remember
okay
so no l c d 
and so no speech as well because it w it would delay too much the development process
yeah that would be cool but eight months is really long and
maybe we can just uh

okay so um i i will uh i
will so i we will move to next meeting so in after the lunch
break uh here are the individual uh action uh you are required
to do but you will be uh recalled to the actions by uh email i think but you can
take notes if you if you want but well the instruction will be sent so
thank you for uh your suggestion and i i will make a summary of that meeting that i will put
in the shared folder you can't see and uh and then you will um
you will be able to to see what has been uh has been said on on
this meeting and and what has been decided uh maybe for next meeting
uh send me your presentation before by email so that we can see them uh altogether
that would be easier
no it did not work she send it to me by email
so maybe this is better to send it by email okay so yeah i i'm it's in the first uh email so i'm participant one at ami uh where is that it's here
participant one at ami
okay
so see you after lunch break


hello


make a start yeah so cable camera
should be in my in their folder no up
um at three i think
no mm

do we think w s in the in the wrong folder maybe
it is possible
it was somewhere in something like this i don't remember the name actually must be something like messenger ami or something
go up
yeah go up
again
no go back
uh maybe messenger ami
messenger
no there is nothing
let's go and check i'll go and check
okay
yeah
yeah so uh basically what we want here is a remote control right
so um the question well first of all what to control so most people want to have a a
remote for their hi fi and t v  and stuff like that and but other people want th also remotes for
controlling uh and toys like robotic pets and little robots and stuff
and other people also want to have remotes for controlling um whole house
yeah so there's a project i think called x  house or something like that that does that uh you can integrate your remote with uh computers stuff so there is one that is one thing the other is the
the finder feature yeah by whistling or whatever uh if you have the finder feature then you can also have
uh at the same time as and general voice commands if you want yeah
so i think it should be a package in that case uh so the user interface will
consist of two parts one is the voice command part and on one is the actual buttons part
uh and th the buttons part would be uh a set of buttons for choosing devices a set
of buttons for special navigation in space
a set of buttons for linear access of medium and a set of buttons for random access
yeah
like a video tape goes forward backwards uh fast and stuff yeah
um
mm
yeah for special navigation for example you might have a t v  in the menu and you going to change yeah uh
mm yeah and also parameter changing so if there are common parameters
maybe we should put special buttons for that um or maybe we could have everything uh generic
but uh there are a lot of uh remotes on the market right now and
basically this is most of the almost everybody has this stuff
voice command w we could specify anything we could assign any button a command to any button if we have enough processing power i guess so yeah
yeah
yeah uh yeah i think so not so far
where did you put it
mm
i'm designing the user interface

but what kind of remote controls did you look at
what kind of task was it it was a t v 
huh
uh huh
ah good
other side yeah yo wa your wrist
it i can become painful you can have tendonditis
yeah
if you also up on a computer in a strange position
ergonomic but uh have to say ha ha
mm hmm
the first question
mm
mm
mm i it's not true i think
the the second claim that you put
yeah i think that should be the same
i have uh i've no idea i mean i should know a bit more about how fast we can uh design it i don't think
uh yeah
yeah okay yeah
yeah
like a you feel a bit like a dog with this stuff


this will think this will take more time to develop also yeah
soon
yeah so the only time problem is the sp voice recognition yeah yeah
ten years

but we don't have time to market
i think we should contact management
well uh
how muc how much do you get how much do you if you buy one million units h no one hundred thousand units
eh chips we're gonna need chips right
yeah how much will it cost for one hundred thousand
okay
so you have any idea for a powerful one that has uh good enough for do speech recognition
yeah okay
so no it doesn't
okay
four million
mh hmm a a lot of people are uh if you have the l c d  screen if you can do it completely the way you want because
the buttons also look the way you want them but it will be hard to configure i mean imagine
i uh so it's really something for the expert user so
i mean there are markets and markets i think the young people are th uh are uh christine here
said uh you have a uh it is yeah so for our young people uh
it will be cool they can be able to use it th maybe their parents will not but they will configure it i guess i don't know if there is
study about that
mm
and there are another thing is that if we make something that's simple and easy to use that's bas to use immediately that means that it will be exactly the same as everything else all right
otherwise if it's different then of course everybody has somebody has to learn to use it first
mm hmm
yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
but teletext is just one button
you you just write the write the numbers
so will you add with the channel keys right
so

i am i'm sure that uh it don't like but uh i don't see just one button
so
mm hmm
capital
well if it is going to be just a t v  remote control it is going to be very simple
well if it's going to be as simple as possible then just have the remote control there is no other function that i can see
really
uh no you want to keep television on so that the advertising can revenue can come back to us or something

it's a memory yeah
and uh and of course the channel changing buttons
how should they how should we implement that because uh could be numerical only or could be also incremental
mm hmm
mm it's an interesting idea that if you press it for a long time it does something else in general so if you you have your ten buttons for the for the numeric the numerical buttons and you have instead of having just one memory
you have if you press them for a long time
no doesn't work does it
maybe we should have a complete keyboard and just type console commands change channel to eight
no
well if it's useful like if if you want to change between three channels for example then you h you cannot you cannot cannot work with just memory being incremental
yeah yeah
yeah when you zap usually you will have to press the same button all the time and
yeah
mm hmm
hey i just thought this thing there is a i mean you know there is are some with a wheel like this instead of having the up down buttons for uh you can have the wheel yeah

yeah
mm hmm
on the lower side i think it you have to turn it no if we do that
yeah
because of that
because it's uh it's it's not like a volume which is smooth yeah the channels change one by one so you have to the user has to like to should feel the the the discrete sense a bit
yeah
yeah even if i l e d  uh or a if if it's the l c d  feature uh whatever yeah
yeah
i think it's only put on if cou have multi function if you do not multi function then there is no p point in having l c d  just increase the cost the user does not have an advantage really
well if it's going to delay yeah but uh it will be cool it would because a user could say c n n  for example and it would go c n n  mm
yeah

yeah what is the folder that you put yours in and did it it did work
ah yeah mm
okay
okay what is your email
at participant one okay
well during lunch break actually
so next time we should have a fight
how about uh management or something
who happens to be your friend



okay
f do you want to start
okay
no
what do you have in short cut
participant two
yeah otherwise could you just describe
by hand with the the whiteboard
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
okay
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
what do you mean by linear access then
ah

mm hmm

mm hmm
mm hmm

i'm just thinking of some thing um
we want to have a no i don't know if this is a good idea we want to have a a general remote control for everything
okay
yeah
yeah yeah yeah
yeah
no no

finish tonight but basically yeah maybe i can continue with my presentation
it would be al you you but i think we have some technical problem or so so i'm just going to describe
briefly what we do in the remote control if fact
yeah but
do i have oh yeah now i have enough cables
okay so i'm just going to describe in fact for for a remote control this is quite easy we just have sorry i'm going
like that i'm just going to describe basically we have a a battery a power supply here after that we just have um user interface let's say that
um
something like that which could be um a l c d  let's say or um an array of push button something like that
push button or a l c d  after that we we feed that into um
uh an electronic chip so i say u c  and i feed that
to uh l e d  which is uh infrared um which is a
an infrared um component and so what we for for myself this
for for us this is quite easy
yeah y it's a it's this just a chip which does all the um numerical
numerical computation according to your display and so for us uh this is quite easy we
just need to take to define what we want to do when the user interface
um wants something and after that we just do the coding to s
and send that to to to the not the to the television so for
us this is quite easy
yeah um we just have to define the processing power that we need uh especially if we want to do some uh speech recognition in that case that mean that we are going to use more for simple
yeah of course of course and um but for a standard one this is really easy it's a question of one month and so on s
no no no no i say yeah standard uh standard remote control takes maybe uh one month to to do that
yeah definitely
i would say i would say uh about eight months to have the first results
yeah i can
um
yeah
yeah even i mean that this is really standard devices now
um eight
for uh speech recognition
and also how much uh i think
during the kickoff meeting you say that we we shouldn't we shouldn't go up to
twelve point five euro per unit so how many units
should we sell to have a
yeah but how many yeah
yeah
usually this is less tha at two dollars per chip
yeah we can
mm hmm
um
i just had a question uh do you want to continue with your presenta is it

um you say that i don't remember by heart but thirty per cent
of the tested people say that's it's quite difficult to to to use the remote control
do they say that this is difficult but for the same reason or do they have other reason
to to maybe to keep in mind maybe to access to that menu you should do something like that
mm hmm
mm hmm and
but yeah maybe and what about if we design a remote control which can be configure as you want you say that i want i have six button
yeah
yeah
yeah
okay
yeah
mm hmm
yeah yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah yeah
yeah
mm hmm

mm
uh i know that som you say that many people are doing plenty of a lot of zapping
i know tha i discovered that when i did a quick look uh they do now som they do something which is quite nice now you have a button you you press it and this is uh the previous channel which has come back
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm

let's say that we can do something like that this is uh incremental but once you press it for a long time you go five by five
to go fa to go faster
yeah

yeah
okay
or we can do something like that we can design the remote control to have access you know some remote control have uh protection and so you you y
you
yeah a kind of joystick
mm hmm
or a or a ball yeah not a a wheel but a ball and you say uh to
yeah
yeah
yeah the yeah
's quite it's quite easy we do that w with back light on the on the wheel
a blue a blue l e d  and we sell that um
yeah
mm hmm
okay
ten years
mm hmm
okay
okay okay
mm
yeah um i dunno if you can open the uh m is not here
uh in
yeah okay no
in document
mm computer yeah
here here
but it's not
um
mm hmm yeah i can do that
okay um
it's participant one
okay you can uh
yeah
okay so you can you can go
okay so in our usability lab we observed the remote control use among one hundred subjects and the subjects also filled a questionnaire okay
and here i have the results so you can see that um
seventy five per cent of users find most remote controls ugly so we have to find something
to make them more
more nice more kind eighty per cents of users would spend more money when the remote control
would look fancy eighty hundred per cent of users would spend more money
when the remote control would look oh to it's not good so
okay so it's not in theory but i i can i can say yeah
fifty f uh seventy five per cent of users say they s zap a lot so mm we
have to have a remote control uh very um out for that
uh the buttons have are to be um uh uh like you say
resist resisting to to shocks um and fifty per cents of users say
they only use uh ten per cents of but of the buttons in the
in the remote control so all the buttons we we have to put are
have to to have um a use a real use and not only
or
yeah f not many buttons and uh and uh uh u useable buttons
sorry
yeah uh most for most is t v 
'kay you can go so
so there are other frustrations expressed by users so they said uh they
lost uh often the remote control in in the room so
they want to have a way to to
to find it um and um lot of the time
they it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control so they want something
s really very simple and uh easy to use
and uh remote controls are bad for
r s i  um
i dunno
yeah


uh
okay um before that i i have some some some thing uh to say before um

we know that uh the user use uh a lot their um remote control um
to to change channel um and um to
to change uh volume selection of the and uh
and not uh a lot for setting for setting the the channels and
uh thing things like that so it's better to put uh
uh uh something very easy to set and uh and
very accessible yes
that's right
so then we asked some questions to them and um we asked this question
if they prefer an l c d  screen or on their remultific function remotes control and
if they mm pay more for speech recognition in remote control and you can go
we have here the results of
of the questions so you know that um
for the younger it's very important
to have the s yes and speech recognition and uh and the others is
not so important but uh we know that uh uh people between fifteen and twenty five
are people who watch a lot t v  and uh who who wh can
use a lot this uh so maybe we we can have a speech recognition in
yeah
mm okay and if there is th the conclusion now so
as we say before i think uh um a remote control lightening in the dark it's it's a
good thing uh not to many mud buttons like we we said before e easy to use
uh a way to find it easily in the room and uh
uh resistant to to shock and to
to
an i s no yeah i dunno if you see something else important or
mm



yeah
mm



mm

mm
yeah
oh would j
uh yeah w i i think they they say that it's uh difficult to learn how to use it but i when you know how to use it it's it's okay but
yeah

mm
mm
mm
mm

mm
mm
mm

mm hmm




hmm
mm hmm

mm
no
no no i dunno i dunno it
'kay thank you
so we come again for the the second meeting
uh for the aim of this
meeting
now is to
to make presentation about
uh the work for each one
and take the the decision about the the design and the functionality of the the remote
control and we have think i got a new project requirement so i think
uh teletext becomes outdated
so the popularity of the since the popularity of the internet and i think we don't need lighting adaptive so the remote control should be only used for the the television
and of course we should have our image
in the in the design
so let's start with the
the industrial designer
or y you can use the whiteboard if you want
here
oh okay
this one
do you want to open

ah

wow

this
you can i yeah
ma

yeah we can change the b
yeah
um
it's mine participant one no
mm
oh we have so let's move to
to user interface design
participant
during the weekend
that's good
mm hmm
this are usual functionality
tasks
and they are small
mm hmm
yeah
what do you mean by the pa pa processing will be done on the t v 
than the
so we should have specific t v  or we can use this
yeah we don't
yeah i think so j j just the remote control
mm
yeah we
yeah
speech recognition
keep the navigation but
so you are
mm
how the this remote
yeah of course small

participant four
so harry

mm hmm
but do you think what they sug suggested s possibility
yeah
it
yeah
but is it useful or not u
i don't know there is in the
mm
i think i
if it's necessary can you can do that we can integrate small microphone in the remote so it's not really a problem
what about lighting adaptive options according to the re to the new requirements i think we don't need that
yeah
mm

so we have i think we have s still we have
couple of minutes mm mm

so any things to
to discuss
or any suggestions
expensive
price
i think we we can we
is the
yeah
so you have to anticipate the the future
in future
okay
so let's go for the the lunch break and
we will meet after
mm hmm

okay



because it's open you mean
f  five





did you draw it
this what is the other chip for the one on top

for men
to the in
okay
mm
what is f p g a 
so why's it how is it different from the bluetooth
yeah programme it
okay
yeah
uh
so this are the they have to work together or do they have to work together or two separate choice
okay
is the is the software par alri okay
okay okay so you can control if you want right
mm


mm mm
mm you can put it on the charger when uh you when you don't need to use it
yeah
yeah yeah
yeah
mm
uh mm y yeah yeah because you are using because you are using bluetooth if some people have p d a  they can use their p d a  to control the t v  if they want to right
i dunno


so is mine
oh
yeah this your
yeah so you can open uh three
yeah
so
so i'm working on the technical functions design
can you show the next slide
so the the purpose is to to find uh the important questions to ask is
what effect should the apparatus have so so i found on a webs
on the internet yeah i spent a lot of time searching
and uh and i found that uh the function of remote control is to send messages to television set
for example switch on switch off switch the next channel and so on and so
on so i found two very good prototypes for for this interface from our
competitors so can you
yeah yeah yeah ours is a bit uh different so these are two example one
is from the other one is from yeah
uh engineering centr yeah this is the most competing prototypes i've found
but then uh loo but then i found if you look at you see on the left one there are too many buttons
yeah o on the right i tried to play with the problem is that uh if i have hundred channels
i have uh i have to choo press the other button to choose the hundred channels and i have to compose
the number so it's very lousy so you so you move to the next the next one
yeah so i talk about the problem and then i i look at the user manual they are a hundred pages thick so we don't want
that so i propose the easy to use uh prototype
you can navigate on t v  screen and we can the user's preference and we need to have
the t v  connected to internet so we end in order to access the t v  programmes by x m l 
and we need some to do some preprocessing from the technical aspect the processing should be done on the t v 
set than on the on the remote controller right and then we
the speech recognition as uh harry says we may just put in we may k i v 
yeah all the processing is done the t v  is a compu has some processing power the
yeah
yeah because are you just wondering what controller okay
yeah
okay
yeah
okay so i the processing on on the remote controller so it can u be used in any t v  any conventional t v  sets
mm okay
n yeah that's all the next one so i come up with a simple design just keep the v navigation buttons
yeah
yeah
yeah
mm


okay that's all

mm
mm no because you choose by channel so you choose by t v  program so you don't have hundred channels to choose from
if you go by channel you don't have to do that
ah
ah a big jump
a mouse or
yeah
mm
mm hmm
uh it's gonna be small yeah so it'll beep
if you wanna find it you just uh shout y h just it just has to re
respond to you when you look for the device i dunno how
bu
and responds to you and




i  mm but i think if you to recognise numbers it's a well studied problem i if you just recognise uh numbers is a limited you have limited vocabulary
mm
yeah
mm
mm
mm
but

mm
yeah
i no i i think that uh i if we go for quality people may tolerate for high quality and of course comes with uh reasonable cost maybe not less but they may be willing to pay
little bit more for comfort yeah extra features
mm yeah
mm
mm
mm

what is the teletext
mm
it is interesting but we are only concerned with the remote controller
so you need s special t v  sets to do that or it's it's done via this remote controller
it's very complex

mm
yeah then we can conclude that
yeah
yeah but it's quite possible but maybe not in this project


mm
mm
okay
yeah okay
mm
mm
using the t v  to access the internet or what i didn't quite understand
yeah okay
yeah the future demand market demand
the functionality in the future alright
yeah because all the t v  sets will be digital right all the programmes everything will be in digital than analog th the system will change and we have to anticipate for those change
okay thank you
okay
okay
yeah alright so uh
well i have a powerpoint pr presentation stored in my
in my personal folder so i i i think you can reach it from here
participant two
yeah
uh open
right so um i will talk about the the w working design and
and um well i i will present my my first idea on how to
build the our new remote control for television so uh can you
go one page down please so i think the first things to do is to define the hardware
components neededs to achieve uh what we want to do so uh mm i'm
thin uh i think uh i i'll do a survey about what
is uh what is available on the market and what what is the the cheapest possible
things we hav we can use
then uh i will try with the technical team to to build a prototype and to see uh
with uh h how this little box would uh look look like
and how an and we can uh start troubleshooting first uh com communication problems or
things like that and when we are ready with this first prototype i i think we can add some software
functionalities on a programmable chip like browsing by content or um things
like that okay so can you go down uh
so wha what i think for now is we
don't want to have a remote control w which is wired so uh i think we u
we can use a battery for the then two programmable chips
for both software functionalities and communication and the communication with the t v  set
is uh made through uh infrared communication
so uh this is the the schema of the
o of the future uh remote controls so uh you can you can see the components uh battery
and uh the two chips goes to the infrared uh connection to the t v 
set
the one on top is for the um well the functionali the functionalities and the
the th red um sorry the green one is is to well putting things together
um f transform the data into uh qu into the format to to uh
to communicate with the t v  set
and that's it i think we should use a f p g a  for for the functionalities which is easy to to t
it's field programmable uh something array yeah
well uh a f p g a  is just a chip you can uh you can pr programme it uh wi with
wh whatever you want and uh well the bluetooth chip is just responsible to uh make
the communication uh between uh the two devices
no well th the f p g a  will produce the the data to send
yeah
yeah alright and that's it for the working design so if you have any questions
uh no no no no i think uh we have uh to to uh have uh embedded uh b batteries
in in the yeah into the t yeah yeah and uh i i don't think it will need
um very uh much power to make it run so
yeah
it's a good idea
yeah
that's a good idea
also but but i i i think uh the the goal is to sell our
remote control s
okay so charger for is the











yeah
of course

so we have to t
we have to sell a t v  with the remote control too
i think there there is there is al there there is a a technology like show view who is
already available on most of the t v  set on recorders or thing like that and we can try t to get
this information on to the remote control to to do the processing on the remote control
because
yes that's a good idea i think we d we don't we we don't need really much buttons to i if we have a screen to navigate on on the t v  so uh
well f four five buttons it's sufficient it's easy to build
it does not consume much power
well then y you you go to the main menu and uh you have uh go to channel and then uh you can
yeah maybe you
but uh i i think i i if you if you want to to make uh well a a big jump
but uh well you you have to to have a a a device when you could
you could
well not a mouse but uh something that that says more clearly that uh right left
up down well the to have the ability to to to write something
to the navigator maybe directly or
so we can think of buttons like in the telephone to send messages or things like that
but we'll see



okay so uh next presentation
mm
well i i think it will be a yes a bit complicated to um make a speech recognisers runs on the small uh ts
yeah
and this can allow to choose the the program for instance without uh adding uh buttons
so it's a good idea

yeah
yeah s s speech is a important extra feature i think
well uh

well we are we we just have to find a mean how to to add a m a a a microphone or uh well yes a microphone into the the remote control so
i well it will be alright
yeah
okay
yeah i think it's a bit complex too
for our next product our new t v  set with uh automatical uh sound adjustment light

function
yeah but well what about the the new project's requirement i i i think we should give up with teletext no
yes
well so maybe we we can j we can already think uh about a way to to access the internet via the television
because if
yeah but uh we can think that in a few years there will be t v  set that can access the internet
so it's a good idea if i i if we i if if we uh
think about how to to to build up our remote uh control
w with this functionality in a w which will c which will come in a few years so if
we already have it in our remote control
yeah yeah
yeah to desi well not not to implement it but to well to find a way to to add to add this functionality in a yeah in an in an easy manner if is possible
yeah yeah
okay so
okay thank you
just go to explorer
or open
participant two
open uh
slide show view slide show

one is a communication
gateway arrays it's a field programmable gateway arrays
yeah
or it's something like isn't hardware the first one and the second one is for the software yeah to run th to make it run that's it
no
okay and how about the battery power uh you mean that battery would be somewhere there and the remote contro the power to the battery comes through infrared
into the more compact and uh okay
yeah yeah okay
yeah that's right having a charger rather than putting the battery cells always people don't like it to have to buy the batteries when they run out we just make a small charger and put it

bu
our remote we do not want to make it p d a 
g

yeah not the t v s
yeah
yeah that's right
yeah that's right
oh but you have a catch there um assume that um if you want to go to if you are watching channel two and if you want to go to channel ninety nine then
uh huh huh huh huh
mm hmm hmm hmm
but
yeah then yeah that's right
mm hmm hmm okay
okay
too small that it goes under the sofa and we can't find it
yeah that's
just give it a name and we call him yeah that's right yeah that's right
okay after having the inputs from industrial design and user interface i
think most of the points which i want to are already covered here and to find the most interesting
features what the users would be interested then what we have done is we have put a feedback forms in all the magazines
and the users send the feedbacks and based on that
these are the findings which we got and yeah adding of a speech interface is always good for a t v  remote but the technology
we already know that as discussed earlier
an it does how feasible it is
oh we can put an limited vocabulary as in the mobile phones we just have the
it's not going to take much space also it's going to be very slim and next one was the size of the remote control it has to be of course a very slim and small one
and of course most of the people are interested in if it's less expensive so this is an important criteria here is
i mean we have to look for a trade off the features and the cost

little bit more if it's with extra features
okay
yeah yeah that's right
i mean for a lazy guys they could say nine and the nine channel comes or they say movie name or i don't go for movie names but only for the numbers on the channel or volume up volume down brightness contrast
so i think this should be a good idea to put this features and the fourth one was the teletext in various languages
mm i think

yeah as discussed in the earlier meeting but i think uh not much people are really interested in this point if it's not really required
i mean
i mean yeah it's for the um industrial design and users interface designers to decide if it's going to be working or not
i think
i think as i discussed th that four points would be good for um marketing
the speech interface and uh less uh reasonable uh cost
and the lighting adaptation and the teletext and regarding the teletext uh these are the
subtitl these are the text information which you got on the televisions if you are watching an foreign movie
you get subtitles sometimes and uh if you are a french guy watching an english movie you would like
to have it in french and if i am a german then i would like to have the my options in german so the
remote it should have some it should give me some flexibility of choosing the ch languages
that should be a good uh point
we already have some
yeah that's right
yeah
okay thank you
okay
could could i see the scroll bar as uh as as a sort of shortcut
a a and the voice recognition as well th maybe you could uh could uh

yeah okay okay good and and the case is is rubber
and the buttons
okay and uh the colouring
with with grey or black
okay we'll we'll come to that later um
okay anything else to add or
yeah
m uh yeah m m but maybe you do want a programme button to uh for example activate the voice recognition or train the voice voice recognition
yeah al although by pressing the button for i n don't know two three seconds you could also say it you'd disable it with a little beep and and but o okay that that's not really really important
the basic okay
okay um you thought of some evaluation crit criteria
okay
you are nameless

no
okay so this these are the cr uh the criteria
okay well
the then we'll switch to my presentation um
the production costs the costs are not under
can i
um this is the
yeah it's it's w way above um uh above the the the twelve euro fifty
and what makes it very expensive is uh for example the solar cell so i guess
we should skip that because it's not that important
yeah the the price the the number of items and the the sum um well this is
what i would call our luxury model um if you would if
you look at the uh w w w what we could do to make it more um
to make it just between the twelve euro fifty um then i
did the following changes twelve euro forty cents i came up with by
leaving out the solar cells um by not using the voice recognition feature
because it's uh it's a four euro uh addition to the price
um
yeah i believe
uh push button well
it makes it the thirteen yeah
push buttons are buttons are are not the most expensive but do add extra cost so um yeah th this design is not um
within our price model
um
yeah
it's still too expensive yeah um
i i guess if we leave the if we leave this one out um oh
and uh maybe not use the special form
it becomes a very dull remote control i know but it's the board decision um
and um yeah
yeah
yeah i know maybe we should look at an uh focus on another uh
yeah m uh maybe not not all that fancy but just way way more easy uh uh um basic and uh m maximise the profits and um
yeah
yeah
i know i know
yeah although i think we yeah but we could still make uh a remote control that ap uh
um applies um more to young people uh by giving it
another colour already um so it is possible to make uh uh a device
that attracts a little bit more to young people
um but uh i agree it's it's not a fancy high tech uh device definitely not no
it's not that innovative or however you s pronounce that um so okay
um
oh this is the wrong one
so uh that means redesign
we do not have the time o uh now to to redesign the product um but we can evaluate the process and um uh
uh the satisfaction on how things went um i'm not sure if we need to evaluate uh the device first
i guess
yeah
yeah that's true
we l we can learn
yeah
yeah
i agree well
i d it is it is
yeah i think so
you like the rubber uh roo

yeah no i'll i'll i'll give it a two
you like tita
that's a flavour as well
right um
yeah i know but but it but that's fancy in the way um

i mean fancy has has a lot of
yeah
yeah
it applies it yeah
yeah
yeah i i agree
well with the voice recognition feature and uh
no we are evaluating this this uh design now
this prototype
yeah
that would have been a thrill
yep
i'm not sure
i'm not sure
yeah
yeah
uh i'm doubting doubting as well um
yeah
okay uh two or three three wha wh what would be your guess i mean ease of use um does not only apply to the most basic functions it's the uh it's it's overall is the device easy to use
yeah
yeah
um
okay uh roo a three ruud
okay
so i could make it e easy
roo
no i haven't said anything yet
okay but if i would say a three then it's six and four is ten divided by four is two point five
but i'm filling in a three does it will so it will be a two point five
yes it is i have a veto exactly it's not about the content it's about okay um is it easy to f
yeah definitely
yeah or beeps or yeah
i'm here i'm here
yeah
yeah
yeah
well i uh we should not uh stay too long on this subject uh because of the time but i personally give it a one um sebastian
right well the feel of the remote control is spongy well uh it can't be more spongy so
no okay but but
for the options given it's the most spongy one
yeah yeah
they're out there yeah
i'll give it a one
yeah i know but you have to name a fig uh a number
because we need to go on in for the time
you are okay the remote control offers enough features well ruud what what do you think about it
yeah
yeah i know what what we didn't talk about is um uh
i think it has
yeah bec because you can um we didn't talk about it but you do have uh remote controls
that are able to adapt another signal so you place a a regular uh
remote control in front of the other one hit the one or the two or the three whatever
and it r records the uh the um the the signals
so you could uh uh uh
enter any comment you like as long it's able to as long as our device is able to reproduce the infrared signal
so i think th this uh this is uh a a remote control with a very high level of features although there are i a few buttons but the inside is is quite uh advanced
yeah
yeah
yep
yeah okay um let's give it a number i'll give it uh a one for for the for this t uh type of market i think it's a one
yeah so high quality low acceptance
the product is is is uh b high qua uh has a high quality and and is uh advanced but

whether or not our clients are are um willing to pay twenty five euros for this kind of device is doub is well is not sure d do you agree
yeah maybe we should have a radar uh function
twenty five euros
yeah
mm hmm
bu but well yeah i know but you're paying for th for the brand because there are uh remote controls which control your stereo television d v d  c d  player for under twenty five euros
yeah
yeah
okay um you had an overall rating um
that's counting
okay
okay um we'll go further on with the the rest of the evaluation
about the project itself not about the product
um
what did you think about uh
the process the project process
ruud
try to translate that
any any other uh roo
roo
yeah
better decision
yeah
less
yeah
so we could we we could be we could've been creative but um it was tempered by the choice of components and the the price
yeah
yeah
okay roo
any other thoughts on that
ruud
you agree okay uh leadership okay roo's on for his promotion
okay
i think so too it's it's it's uh of course a laboratory environment i missed it
um to be able to contact you in between and uh say uh hey roo uh
um
yeah so um
yeah but but si uh w w w when taken in account the the situation uh i think we performed pretty well
yeah um the means the smartboard the digital pen did you like 'em
because of the response or
okay
uh
okay so it it had to be um
better aligned or what's the word uh yeah
it it was calibrated just before this meeting uh the one before the third meeting so uh it's not the calibration it's the thing itself i think uh ruud w uh did you use the pen a lot or not at all not at all
okay i thought it was quite a handy uh thing although i would like to see um o c r 
yeah
to digitise them
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
i know
yeah okay um
what w uh ruud what did you think about the smartboards
yeah okay you can't really decide no i missed a feature to easily
select uh a slide and uh distribute it to the laptops i think that would
be very easy if you could say okay i want to use this for my own work or my own presentation further on or
or the other way around that you could show but m
i know
i know but
i know but we couldn't use that feature so i missed it
we weren't able to do that
at least the um i wasn't explained how to do such a th
okay
yeah
okay so y it it's not even as advanced as paint
yeah
okay
uh no yeah the project is evaluated um but well we need to redesign uh the product
celebrate
okay
um you're dismissed no i think we are uh ready
private room roo
that sounds quite scary
no let's find uh the way to
i don't believe so well maybe we'd
get an email
thank you for your
forty minutes
a minute or or ten maybe
m yeah ten or five
so we can uh
redesign our uh
uh i would like to
oh yeah
yeah
it's blue tongue
yeah this is a new model but
blue tongue
it's spongy
that is uh it's a new feature next to bluetooth to um disable all bluetooth devices um
yeah we're done here
gentlemen thank you for your cooperation

yes

that's the same as uh on the top of it uh with the the round uh button
but uh we don't uh we don't uh we do think it's um well what if with ease of use w
which prefers the which the the customer of the user prefers
plastic or rubber well yeah

and a button for disabling the voice recognition
yeah
that's the basic idea yeah
of our prototype


so just walk through it step by step i mean is it fancy everything i believe uh
i believe it's fancy
oh sorry
twenty two
yikes
why does the price and and the s oh one uh exa yeah
the number of uh yeah
and and does it
but that's that's only for the buttons so the button we can use plastic
and the pla uh
and a plastic b just plastic buttons a plas uh instead of rubber

yeah too bad
mm hmm

um the yellow rubber i think so
i'm into it



it's trendy trendy fun yeah
well just give it a two
it's not the ultimate uh fancy two but
yeah but that's sti that's uh
looking at the user uh needs we only uh don't we don't have the double curved case we w we do have uh the rubber we do have the colours that's two out of three
so i believe uh we are close uh to two

but that's not in it ov or can we
okay
and the scroll uh wheel the solar not many remotes
have the solar i think
yeah
well yeah the voice recognition of course is hard to learn i think
well hard it's not for the for the e for the elderly
they won't use it
i think
i think a three wouldn't give it more
yep

if you make it a four it will be three in general
if he makes it a four
not a three
darn nee
a seven a three no a four and a three together yeah you have a two he has a two three and a three nee i know
yes so if you want to have the conclusion as a three three then you would make a four if you fill out a four
yeah we haven't re uh re uh really worked it out but you c you can you can just say find and he repeats find
yeah but that's the that's the the basic idea of the the speaker uh
but even without it
yeah
me too
was it one of our options
so in the in
yeah
but i think in this case in this case we've done the best we could
i wan i'll take one
it will be a one



yeah but it ha doesn't has the digits i believe it's
if you uh ask yourself it offers enough features i don't i don't think
it is it has all the features um a normal remote has
yeah
i'll give a two


but we could couldn't uh what what's the selling price fifty uh twenty five
and costs were twelve fifty but even now if only our production costs w uh were exceeded the double
think production cost was were t uh was twenty two
so uh selling price uh would be uh yeah
that's price but w w
no an original remote control of any t v  kind uh a phillips remote control y you pay uh
yeah i kn i know uh from a few years ago it it it costed hundred gilders
four six seven eight
nine divided by six

hmm
yeah i think uh
the process was good
but w um we weren't aware of the prices of the costs and and that was the the big deal i if we knew that before we c we could have made the the choice between what yeah
no no
fantastic


yeah


yeah
yeah
response and
uh it it has yeah yeah it's not accurate the p the pointing of the pen is not um the place where it it writes its um uh where it uh
yeah where it draws it's uh the drawing on on the b on the board is r right from the pen
so uh
you to take in account that your you m yeah uh
it's too slow
hmm
yep
if it has o c r  uh i think uh i would use but uh i i just uh took notes for myself and and and that's it it w it w yeah it was necessary for me to uh
yeah because if i want something on the computer i just type it i type faster than i write so
economic


yeah
but y you can if you save this image you can open it in your shared work folder so it's almost yeah
yep
mm hmm a and the function of of filling an an uh an oval or an an object
i it's not possible yeah
oh it looks like paint actually
great
it was a privilege working with you

to private rooms


but you see the problem y you can't continue your uh your line
well it's fluffy alright spongy
a giraffe



right

leave it here
that's alright
like this one
it's important
uh i think th this is device which which has a learning curve um novice users u
use this device as uh normal users use uh a c a remote control and after a while they start to
develop uh some skills in the the voice recognition functions and then they will
not use this dial as often but other users who are new to this device need something
like that they n they need to understand what uh how to change channels and
uh change the volume so it's easier for them
yeah maybe so yes it's
well it's it's it's another approach it's more that our um there are there are many ways of doing uh things uh on such a device it's it's quite easy
yes rubber
there are plastic or rubber
uh yellow with uh
grey or black or something like that whatever cost uh cost uh the least

no uh maybe we should uh think about these buttons but
yes but it but these are tasks that are only executed once i think or not
well okay okay yeah that's right or something li like that
yes


is it spongy
i believe it's fancy too
okay
well it's very expensive
okay
okay
mm hmm
mm hmm
hmm
okay
but i'm afraid it's not complete because we use spec uh specic uh special materials the last item and you have not added one item there
so it's c way too expensive

but it
yes
well b basically it when when this is our only option we should even consider
changing the casing because i think there's very little added value in uh an enhanced
case with these dull functions so
type of m maybe another market segment
yeah
yes
that's maybe that's better maybe we could uh we should go for straight and simple but that's not what uh has been asked
so we should kick the board's uh well
hmm
yes



well maybe it's good to do it anyway because if we evaluate it we we can also determine if our objectives are good so
is it fancy


i think so

but it's not that fancy
i mean
i think uh i think it would have been more fancy if we used the titanium housing the casing it would be even more oh you really like titanium i'm i'm into it
it has flavour yes that's right you should taste it
it has to do with fashion i guess so do
okay
yes i think i th i think it would have been i would have think uh it could have been more fancy by using the
double curved case it would have been even more fancy but we decided not to because if
we use a double curved case we could not use solar so
yes
yes i agree too it's okay we did yes we did good
well let's let's this product
so i i i think it is i think it's innovative
no it could have been a little bit more innovative u by using the kinetic uh energy source but it's it's way too yes but
i think uh it's a two

well but there are two parts in this remote control what you see here is is the basic part everybody
can use it so that's easy to use that's for a novice user when you have a more advanced elaborate
user well such a user really would like to explore all these additional functions
so in that in that way it is advanced
and i think it's easy to use for for both uh types of users
so uh
it's maybe it's not very uh easy for
okay
yeah that's right you're right in that but i i guess uh an advanced user will will find the voice recognition function easy to use
because he is already he or she is already an advanced user so
after all i think personally i would give a two but
so it's two two and three two threes so that's ten
so that's w
no two and a half
six and four six and four is ten divided by four is two and a half
so
yes

four
two
divided by four
that's not even
but that's not possible to fill in so we have to round it
yes
it it most definitely is it's very easy
yes
maybe uh i i think i think something like that maybe you have to uh programme it once
so to that l respond to uh a certain word or a certain sentence something like where are you
and then it will sing i'm here so something like that so i th

yeah me too
well it can be there are cases um in which the outside casing is
um can be uh how d how do you prono is is moldable no it's not one of our option
but when you look in the market when you look
uh yes but that's not that's not uh what they are talking about i think because we compare all these uh
characteristics characteristics with uh market uh with with the real market so there are
uh remote controls out there which are a lot more spongy they're out there
yes but it's not good enough so it's a two
you take one what do you give it
no no no uh i'll i'll change it i'll make it m my my mark will be a four
basically it's it's completely programmable you can add very m much functionality by uh using the voice recognition mode
so it's quite advanced
yes
has uh the signals sent to it
absolutely
yes
but that that's its power i guess because uh a regular programmable uh remote control contains well uh really
a lot of buttons at at least uh forty buttons so it's it's quite s complicated
to get uh to get used to and this is quite s simple you can use your voice to to
programme it it's
yeah i'll give it a one
yes i i've i think we've uh succe succeed in in developing a product that's actually quite good but not for this kind of market and not for this kind of price so
hmm
yes
mm hmm
mm hmm
yes i agree i
yeah okay but
yes
m about fifty euros
that's quite ex well it's not it's not very expensive for a remote control that that has this functionality
yes it's more than fifty euros it's quite expensive yes
yes yes but you can you c
yes but you can learn this thing all these functions and it's easier to use because those uh remote controls don't offer voice recognition and this one does so i think it's worth its price
well it's it's about one point five something like that

well
well i think

mm
actually we had
yes we had we had too little information actually so and uh um the the the well looking at room for creativity there was
w way too the the choice of components was way too narrow so there was not really a process of uh
well
yes
well in the first meeting we we already were very creative we we thought of possibilities who are not possible uh with the the current uh offer of uh manufacturing components so
we're tempered by that yes

yeah okay
i think we're a good team
yes

well i tried once but that was not allowed
i think so too
uh the digital pen was okay but smartboard was really bad it it's
the response is very slow and the possibilities are very limited it's not accurate
maybe it's it needs to be calibrateds
it is okay
okay
i i think so too
yes
yes
mm hmm
but i think it's a great solution for uh for uh a known problem uh writing down some notes
some some inf uh information and then um forgetting your notebook somewhere and losing
all that information because you have everything in one place and it's quite easy quite
easy it's it's possible to make this information digital and share it with others in a quite easy
way i think it's a good product i only think it's th the the shape of the pen is too
big it's not quite uh ergonomic
eco ergonomic
yes
yes yes
that's quite what powerpoint does
an object yes yes the drawing cap capabilities are very limited
and and uh w you were when you're using uh windows you're used to a certain interface and certain buttons uh which you can use for drawing and a lot of these buttons don't appear here so it's
not not uh n not way it's quite uh limited

okay oh very good celebration
pop uh pop up the champagne
okay
i see some action over there

okay

uh we're done we're finished i believe so
are there any more cycles in this process i think not
but um how much time did we get for this meeting
and how much time is left
ten minutes
okay
okay
well i think we we we all know what the redesign should be a simple dull uh one coloured box
no it's it's just the same product that is already on the market
what is that
it's a giraffe eating a eating leaves from a tree
so you're actually promoting bluetooth or blue tongue


blue tongue
okay
let's wrap it up

thank you mister manager now let's have uh a bottle of champagne
well you could use two of them to programme the um channels on the two channel button 'cause you have to assign two channel new channels
you
yes
uh my name is not name but
uh well i used the the uh documents
and these uh
were the most important criteria
it should be yeah that's uh how the fashion guys uh state it fancy look and feel so
uh well appar
yeah but apparently uh we shouldn't evaluate yet so
yeah i think these are the most important criteria
so uh that's about it
um well since we're not gonna manufacture it anyway
uh
yay
is it
is it fancy

so uh one

is it uh
and w yeah w what they want wanted was uh colours and soft materials so in that way
it it's fancy
okay and uh was it
innovative

yep
yeah and uh
so uh also a uh two
is it easy to use

well the p the most important function is easy to use
the the zapping channel switching volume
but the more advanced functions are probably
a bit harder
good question
uh i'll go uh for the two

hmm huh
yeah i yeah
yeah two two three
no


is it easy to find

yeah i agree

no uh this this was a most spongy option

well yeah it depends 'cause it's the most spongy we could but yeah
well if i give it a one
there'll be one hell of a calculation so i'll just give it a two and make this a one point five

well the basic layout doesn't offem offer much but the voice recognition could add a lot so
yeah depends
uh depends on what you uh implement in the speech feat
signal
um i think think a one 'cause v with a voice recognition you could add anything you want so that's like um
maybe even because it doesn't look advanced

yeah but uh with these ratings uh
should be about one point s seven yeah



ye
the prices
i agree




draws
no not really
oh i only use it to draw a rabbit so can't say much about it
no or the other way around
yeah

and no added value
at all so
in interesting design

oh uh it it does uh have a natural uh feeling so
yeah


so
i hope you're ready for this uh functional design meeting
um so i will take the minutes you mm you three are going to do presentation
um uh we want to know to at the end to know the new project's requirement
so we need uh to know the the user uh needs
that we want to fulfil to fulfil the from the technical part we want to know how
it going to work and um
third part uh i don't remember which is not very good
ah of course how to to design this uh this yeah
so
um let's go for the three presentations so first um marketing expert
so wait a minute mm
sounds uh
mm uh
hmm
okay
f  five
mm hmm mm



why not

okay uh tha that's look great
mm hmm okay
or something we don't know mm hmm

okay




i have been told that we uh don't consider teletext that it's out of date now because of internet
mm hmm
mm hmm

mm mm okay
mm i think it's good okay you done a good review
mm hmm
mm hmm mm mm okay that's good point
okay
so um now i think it's the turn of the
the i'm not sure um
of the technical function so
uh
what effect
okay
wait a second argh
so you're

okay let's go


oh sorry
okay oh sorry



it's off it's on

or you want to go to the kitchen

mm
um i see that you target uh several s application not only t v  but i like we talk about um universal uh remote control
yeah
hmm
mm hmm

hmm s
mm
since we were targeting a really soon uh uh date for the the
the um i issuing of this uh remote control i think we will only concentrate on t v  for the moment and
then maybe m make it more generalised yeah
yeah it's it's the same solution i think hmm
yeah uh on zap it's only next next next next next yeah
mm hmm
maybe we can make uh different modes for each button and you can change mode zapping mode or
uh current chan
yeah
mm hmm

okay
uh you're finish okay so now the technical aspects of this new device
mm
you prefer it
mm hmm
okay
to make it quite uh an universal uh device uh
mm
okay
okay
mm hmm
mm hmm and from from the discussion we had do you can you make it on the whiteboard or mm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm
on
uh train it okay
mm hmm

mm and what about the price of this component
it mm okay
mm
okay
mm hmm
mm hmm
with a keywords and yeah
mm hmm mm
mm hmm
okay
okay


no in no not only speech yeah
i it's an option
okay
sho to to train okay
mm
and well what about the idea of automatic on off on the button yeah

wouldn't that make uh arguments i want uh
and we can increase this the strength y you can buy one with
mm hmm
okay you have mm something else to say uh
no
okay thanks
so
mm
mm i think okay we're just on time
um mm mm
so we're now going to l have the lunch break
then we will work again for thirty minutes individual work and um
we will uh meet again for the next meeting and uh in this one want to
to be more focused on the individual actions the um on the components so
uh
you will focus on the component concept um
uh of course the u i d  mark will be uh focused on the user interface
concept and uh our m market expert sammy benjo
uh on the trend watching
so um of course like before specific instruction will be sent to you by your personal personal coach
well i think that's all
and we have um maybe we have to we say only for t v  not teletext uh i think automatic on off control uh it's not possible
yeah maybe in the next uh step if we make it work um
yeah implemented o okay we can think about that
and um
do you see something else
uh yeah that's
or maybe you want to phone him
since now all yeah
think
uh huh
and uh
and it's answered

clap clap clap it's a good i i think it's universal
what about people without hand yeah
mm uh okay
mm hmm okay
mm hmm
mm hmm so let's to think s so that yeah i think that could be in the component uh concept uh
it yes
okay
so yeah let's go to lunch

sammy benjo i know this name uh we met before
f  f  five
agree
r s i  mm hmm
no i don't think so
okay but twenty six percent do you know
twenty five
every fourth you know every four some of us knows
one of us
mm hmm
functions

mm hmm
i got one question uh you are a market expert so should we aim at the young people or not
okay then teletext is used less
okay
mm hmm mm hmm
mm okay
that's me
that's but this but number three yes
mm hmm
so my name is mark dwight and um i am responsible for user interface design
however uh mm project manager asked me to give you some presentation
about technical functions design
uh as i'm a more an artist that's gonna be less technical functions but more user interface and current intentions and everything which is linked with this so next slide please
and uh a general method which is seems to be very useful for our task is not to
forget about uh occam razor we should never complicate things too much we should
only make a remote control nothing more nothing more than this just a remote control
'cause current remote controls they are never easy enough to use
so make a click please
so here is this remote control
it's quite a standard one but it's not from a t v  it's from a much
easier device like air conditioning or something but you know we can use it for a t v  easily
only buttons we need is on off volume channels and maybe some options or something else and please make a click compared to this one
which one would you prefer i guess this
sure sure
yeah and our method is going to be provide simple
simple desires into simple actions
findings
our question of the style we should remember that our company
puts fashion into electronics
and we should never forget about it
concept be simple be simple and you'll lean on this market market is a of remote controls you know it better it's very
well it's
it's not an easy field to to play you know
so be simple for personal preferences i think that to make a baby proof remote control it got to be a titanium
it's a really good style it going to be look like like this
it is unbreakable and it is very universal
w we'll have a screen with a back light which can change colours
and we can put all the options into this screen we'll need only few buttons all the other things can be controlled through the screen
and all these buttons should be easy to find and to click 'cause when you watch a movie and you want to change
something you always try to find a good button and click it but you should do it by touching
it and finding it easily just by touch so
press
i would propose this concept for design just few buttons a screen with a back light which can change colours titanium
i think and uh what else i got just very few and good ideas we need power and volume
and let us include two nice features into this device first power on and off can be made fully automatic
when you go to the sofa take your control and point it to the t v 
the t v  turns on
when you don't touch the control but you go out of the
for for enough time like uh you
it's a question to our technical design our two engineers and another
nice feature that i would like to implement is uh volume control suppose you set u you set up some
volume and then you move out or you move to the other corner of the room
and take your control with you
like you want to to change the chair or you want to move to the armchair from the sofa or something and then the volume changes
it's easy to do you just control the
according to the distance yeah yeah yeah
so
i think it can be just a menu which can be controlled with a left right up down and enter
so its main purpose in fact is a back light which change colours which makes it easier to find
and each can it can respond for your voice like it can turn on the light for you just to f find it easily yeah
so basically that's it
can be easily done 'cause
you got simple designs y we should put it to simple actions let it be universal so you want to use it for your hi fi system you want to change tracks and you want to adjust volume
just few actions a few actions for everything all the rest we sh we'll put it into this menu on the screen
okay okay
okay but it's quite universal you know
we can just extend it to any device
uh twenty five
mm hmm
in fact i would propose another solution basically you use just four or five channels right
yeah so uh set up your t v  set like
channels that you use they're one two three and five and you will never have to go to a twenty fives
channel
mm hmm
mm we got these buttons here next next or say this can be back
could we carry out some research if we w really need this like how many people really need to go to channel number twenty five and then to sixty four
okay
okay
alright thanks for your attention
too complex
okay
okay
um
okay
no you know it's a conceptual question 'cause now i see th this the picture in front of my
eyes like a user taking his remote control and shouting into it volume up volume up and and
he's coming you know he's really annoyed with this down up down
okay for this budget like twelve euros
mm hmm
okay 
mm hmm mm hmm
did you consider the r gest uh gesture recognition like if i want to put volume up i like do mm i take my remote control do like something like
roll 'em up or roll 'em down
mm why that's just

we got a really good market expert let's send more let's sell more
okay
uh should it be equipped with the
uh with uh speakers
like you want to find it you shout
control and it answers is i'm here or
just beeps
i can't whistle no no i can't
mm
okay
just don't interfere with other devices like 'cause like all these people do that their lights are turning on with clapping
yeah i got it at my home like oops

yeah it is put f  five
the full page presentation yep
yeah yep
yeah



yeah
yeah
yeah
you can you are

hmm



yeah it's electromagnetic waves or something kind of maybe uh effect
yeah because infrared uses some electromagnetic technology and those waves have high
uh
uh
yeah it's
people really
yeah yeah
uh
hmm

yeah
'cause
thank you
mm
mm
mm yep
thank you
uh it's
techni function of
yeah
i have to do working design so uh
mm
it's
yeah yeah
yeah maybe it can be yeah middle of like between those two li
s you should yeah


mm
distance
yeah
mm hmm
mm
mm yeah and it mm
mm
mm
yeah
but even we can have some uh l c d  display like you can uh de you can just button the number and then it go t because
yeah
but still
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah 
yeah
but otherwise like we can put some display on numbers and then they can just press suppose two five they just press two and five and then
yeah
yeah
yeah yeah
yeah yeah
yeah but since we are focusing only on t v  remote controls so we can have more functions for t v  uh if you want to go for a universal then we ought to limit for functions for each of our devices
yeah yeah

two
yeah if
sorry yeah uh as you know i am mister ramaro i am an expert
in uh industrial design of all electronic devices and i previously devised
many uh like digital calculators and electronic calculators so now i'll
briefly describe the working design of our remote control
well as you know the basic function of remote control is sending some message to the the device like t v  or v c r  or d v d  player etcetera
so we will have a p portable device which will send message to the the main device like t v 
so we need to have some energy source to do what to do the functions what we want on this portable device
and usually this so to do these functions we need an interface which basically some kind of pressing buttons or keys or like moving jack or something like that
and then these messages these key buttons can be transferred into some kind of
message and then it will process by the chip and then it will generate some information
to the main device
it's generally in the form of infrared or
some kind of s sensor information then we will have the main control in the main device to do the particular action what we want
so basically we need uh since we are focusing on our interface device remote control
we need few components mainly the energy source like the battery and then we have
user interface like uh the keypad and you know buttons we want
and then we have some chip it's mainly digital signal processing chip because since we are
i am one doing mostly digital uh devices we ought to have some kind of processor
which take care of all these functions and put it in some digital format
and then we'll have the infrared l e d  source which sends the information to the main device
then we'll have switch in our main uh um device to do particular operations and we ought to
do different codes for different t v s so some t v s will have different
encryption codes for doing s s uh channel changing and these things
yeah yeah because the people don't use one particular brand so or at least we have more more than five brands which are really good
so we need to check their specifications and do their uh encryption that's passing information to the t v  device so we need to have particular encryption codes
then components so we have the main uh energy source
and then we will have some buttons and then we will have infrared uh source
and then we have some inside some chip in in the device
uh since i don't have much time so i'll input the connections to all this components
and since i also want to know feedback from our marketing expert and
user interface so if you want to add some more components we can incorporate them
yeah
yeah i'm sure because since our user interface
speech recognition and also marketing expert for the speech recognition is really
handy so we can have another like uh s simple speech recogniser on
our d s b  chip since we have some kind of uh energy this is our
this normal battery so this battery once you s switch on it will take power and
we can have some speech recognition and in our g generally small digital signal processing
chip so that and we will put uh the small uh simple speech recogniser
and we can also train the speech recogniser for particular user so you just
yeah so that we just use simple recog no but
but
yeah no even in you can find even simple mobile device like any mobile brand you can have these voice dialers or these things yeah
yeah
yeah
so
uh maybe we can make uh it in five euros and even less than that because we want to have
uh millions and in bulk so we can make really simp and we want to make really simple device
because we have only very few words like like power switch on or
some like then we'll have something like this um
we'll have volume
and then we will have s particular channel so users can listen
ye
no yeah a user can use any kind of sender but they should have this prompt volume
and then yeah volume and decrease or increase so we try to only recognise those words
and and because we can't really say user to say same wording then it become more mechanical and
yeah
and then we can have channel they can say okay i want eight because we don't know like users have
different programmes i mean they don't really follow same channels strict uh so we just want channel number we don't
want like b b c  or c n n  or something else because
it will be complicated so we'll have only these three uh main basic uh anyway volume is not really speech recognition problem it's it it will be take care of our main mm
yeah actually we we can have one switch to like uh switch on on and off this processor and
this really suppose like here we have our main chip which controls power volume and this part and this d s p s
again this to have some interaction like suppose people use d s p  then it particularly sends some information to the chip like in some form like volume and like this key
so it may not be like very expensive because since we are only focusing on t v  remote control so and we have only few things here
yeah
um uh uh this point we didn't consider because it's it's very expensive because v our target is only like twelve point five euros and
yeah even automatic on off is also a bit problematic because it different criteria for different
people like so suppose people are really uh they just uh they don't touch the remote and
mm y you don't know how much time you need to switch on or switch off and
yay yeah
yeah that can be possible especially for power settings so user can say okay suppose they're watching a tennis match or something then they can say okay uh after one hour i
they can make

yeah we can have

yeah
uh not very much like yeah
thank you yep
thank you
can you just yeah

yeah yeah
mark will
uh it's in current price yeah
yeah
but speech recogniser can be possible
yeah yeah yeah
yeah especially the power it really consumes because it should be all the time on and
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah

yeah i think it's good
but it's a good feature i guess yeah we need to think about more how to incorporate it
oh
ah it's
yeah
yeah thank you thank you very much
so
of course


nice stuff
who starts
oh ha okay so i dunno if i can do that like this yeah
so it's being modified do you want yeah open read only i hope i saved it so um yeah this is my name
so as you know you i think you already know me sammy benjo i am the expert in marketing and i want to tell
you about what people uh s want and uh like and dislike in remote
controls and i hope this is going to help you to to design it correctly so next please
uh oh
hmm
yeah maybe in the full page because i i spent lots of time doing this presentation so
uh huh hmm okay
so basically uh what i suggest is that uh instead of deciding ourself what what
could be and what should be a good uh remote control let's ask people who are users of remote controls
how they feel about w the current remote controls what they like what they don't like and um and what
they do with them by the way because they are supposed to be useful
don't forget about that so we've we've conducted a a survey on on the use of uh remote controls and i'd like to show you some of the results we found on this survey
and next please
yeah so basically what we found was that uh there are several things that the user don't like in remote controls
first of all they find it very ugly current remote controls as you know they're
the same as this one uh they're not nice colour not nice shape i mean they're
all the same and they're not l good looking
um what is interesting is that in fact it seems that they were people are ready to pay for nice and look
and fancy looking uh remote control so i think we should probably spend lots of time in and effort
in that um
and the other thing is that uh the the current remote controls are not so easy to use and it it
the the current uh facilities that they offer do not match what people really want
to use their remote controls
for instance uh we see that uh they zap very often so i think this is a very uh important uh functionality that it should be easy for them to to zap uh in one way or another
and most of the buttons uh on uh current remote controls are not used so i think we should
design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than
others that only a couple of people are using
um next please now people are very frustrated
w with their remote controls and they for instance uh
they don't even find it it's it's often lost somewhere in the in the in
your home and nobody knows where it is
maybe if we have something where we could ask the remote control please where are you like uh
something to to like t i think phones some of the phones have some of this kind of s functionality
uh of course phone you can always phone your phone but you can't phone your your remote control
but why not yeah
and because of the fact that there are so many buttons in these remote controls that nobody use in fact they don't even know how to use them so most of the the people say they they don't know how to they to use properly their r remote controls
and uh they are bad for r s i  but uh i don't remember what is r s i 
so i think they are bad
mm hmm mm nobody has any idea about that well i'll check uh with
my
oh okay i think it's a technical thing which our
okay
so it seems that it's a lot of people for a concept that we don't know but we have to take this into account

so anyway that's for what the biggest frustration uh of the user and um
what else do i have next slide
ah yeah so we've listed a couple of uh
s uh functions that may be uh used by u the user in the current uh
available uh remote controls and uh well the tables look very nice to read
but what is important is to understand that the power button is not used often because
in general you use it only once per session but it is very relevant
people want to have a power button channel selection is uh o often used very often used and indeed uh very relevant

ah now i remember what is r s i  it's repetitivity stress injury
we have to be careful with that word but uh anyway i continue my presentation so yeah channel selection is um very important very often used
volume is not often used but people uh want to have control on volume and that makes sense of
course and n then you have things which are very much less often used like the settings audio
settings screen settings even teletext and channel settings
all of them they're not often used and they are s more or less relevant it seems that people find teletext teletext uh relevant even if i personally never use it but seems that it's average relevant at least so
i can tell you that uh in a l in a scale between one and ten relevant uh not relevant to relevant people scored a six on this which is not as uh these these two one were had i think ten i think
but but if you compare with these ones uh i think they scored a one or two not very relevant so
if if there are good reason not to put teletext it's okay but just know that people find it somehow relevant
that's for the main functions i think and uh then we can ask uh ourself uh what people don't have that may be useful for instance i think net next slide
one of the thing the trend uh that uh you are probably aware of is the possibility the eventual possibility
of having speech recognition in your remote control so you wouldn't have to tap tap in your buttons but just
tell your remote control or whatever you need you have what you want
so we've conducted a survey about uh whether people would like or not to have uh this kind
of uh functionality in their remote control and as we can see it really depends on the age young people
probably because it's a buzz word find it very relevant
and uh as the age goes up the the relevance goes down
so now it really depends on the kind of uh targeting uh wha who are we targeting with this
remote control i think if we are targeting young people then uh it's probably something we have to consider
if we are targeting you very old people this is something they really don't know why they this should be so now this is of course depends on that
and um i don't have any conclusion i didn't have time the meeting was very tight so that's basically my findings and uh if you have any question
i can go back yeah one question yeah
i am
i think we should aim at the young people but uh i think they are they are those
uh who might be more interested in a in a new device in general the the early adopters
of a new device are young people less than more than
then teletext is useless for them i think yeah because they they have other means of finding their information yeah but yeah nope
'kay

so i think it's you huh
no
no user requiremen





makes sense


i would say the simplest one as long as there are the uh i find the buttons that i need every time i need a button

nice nice sentence



mm



mm hmm
hmm
and when does it turn off
oh so you have a
sensing sensor machine that uh knows
tech
mm hmm
according to your distance to and the angle maybe if you have a stereo system
uh i'm not sure about the screen wha what is the use usefulness of the screen uh is it a touch screen by the way
so it gives instructions but uh it has to be with an back light somehow
okay
okay
so for instance if i want to go to directly to channel twenty five how would i do can i do that with this
yeah mm let's say i am uh on channel eight now you know these days we have hundreds of channels that's not so easy to go just next next next when you have hundreds of channels or is it
most people yeah
in fact in in one uh remote control that i've seen instead of doing that d you could just say these are
the cha ch channel three twenty eight forty eight and uh sixty four are those that i want
to by cycled with my next button i uh
b yeah
go to channel twenty five one thing is that as i said in my presentation people really do
like to z zap so even if they are only watching four or five channels i think they want to zap
out of the one hundred channels just because this is one kind of thing they do zapping
and it's only next yeah so but you have to
okay
so it would be
okay
mm hmm alright listening more
mm hmm
okay
well i could could uh have a look at that maybe i'll check in my department if there's someone specialist in that
although i don't know
mm hmm
mm hmm

but uh very very good to sell
think of a all these young people who would love to say that this remote control only works for them and ha ha you cannot use my remote control because it's targeted to me whatever
hmm cheap
millions
cheap
the user uh will just be able to say uh please can you uh pump up the vo pump up the volume or or it will be something like volume up down
okay
okay
couple of words
okay
of course uh it has to be
okay
but then i think you
you

first of all i i think this is not uh functionality that it is going to be instead of using the buttons it's on top of using the button
well i dunno
t v 

very expensive no
and volume control
so but uh
sh should we target a a user personalised uh uh remote control so in in a given room there might be more than one remote control we would uh have each one and uh with our own personal uh settings
hmm
yeah of course that's no problem we will sell more
yeah exactly
okay thanks
mm great

difficult
mm hmm
no
speakers in the remote cont
oh yeah
it just beeps that would be enough something very cheap
but that's ex that's expensive uh
well i i heard of devices where you just uh whistle them and and they because of the the frequency they they just answer to that you can't whistle uh huh or a clap
you can clap can you clap is good tak
just a suggestion with only one hand these are not our target people
mm hmm
oh that's e that already exists okay okay oh yeah you do have wow you're trendy
think about it yeah okay
okay
good we're done right thanks
hi kate okay carry on alright
um this is the beginning of the third meeting the conceptual design meeting
um our agenda should be um that we're opening the meeting i have
the minutes from the previous meeting are on the shared f drive at this point um and we should each have
a presentation to make um we have certain decisions to make and we have forty minutes
total it's twenty five after two at the moment so forty minutes
is five after three um which i'll be keeping an eye on the clock
for us okay
um there are the decisions we have to turn to but we'll come back to them in a minute after i take us to the
minutes of the previous meeting
right um as we remember i opened the meeting the four of us were present
the meeting the first meeting's minutes were reviewed and approved um sarah you presented
a marketing research report um which pretty much rep represented that fifteen
to thirty five year olds uh it has to be hand held power channel volume
number keys possibly a speech recognition
and then steph did a second presentation um that those
functions plus streamlining them with big user friendly keys that were easy to
use i think all of us agreed with those things kate presented a working design
of going after going over the basics on the whiteboard um that it should be a simple mass produced
device because of the twelve and a half pence cost um but we did talk about possibly
using rechargeable batteries and having a docking place as a selling point um and the new
requirements that it for be for t v  only um and that it include the l so slogan
and colour of the uh corporate design be included
um
the corporate image
so we agreed that the target market would be fifteen to thirty five with more money than sense
that were decision makers alternatively it would be a manufacturer to enclose it with the t v  but it still should
meet those parameters um and that the function we agreed was volume
power numbers enter channels a way to move between channels
easy to use and hand held
um at that point we agreed that sarah would look at the current cost of competition what what do the
current ones sell for um and steph was gonna look at ec ergonomics kate
was gonna look at cost and feasibility of the various possibilities that we discussed and i was to type up
these minutes and work on the final report
is this a fair presentation of what our last meeting was
okay
right so we're ready to close that and go back to our
that one
right we're up to the point of the
go back
um the three presentations so we're going to pull the plug on me and turn to sarah is that okay
is that alright with everybody else especially since kate asked to be last sarah i'm sorry if i misspelled your name i didn't know whether it was s a r a  or s a r h 
you respond to whatever you get huh okay
um did you do your hit
ah there it is
ta da
mm 'kay
'kay


mm
it sounds like the the uh covers that they use for the remote you know your t your cell phone
mm
hmm
uh huh mm
in most families don't isn't the remote is a remote
mm
mm well actually some households do have three and four t v s and they would have a remote for each one so
hmm
hmm

are we talking about the device itself or the c or a cover for the device that would be an interchangeable cov cover as a separate
product
perhaps perhaps that desi that particular suggestion needs to go back to management and perhaps go to another group to actually design as a separate product
wo would that be agreeable
do you wanna be next or you want kate to go next
okay we'll move the

mm
mm


alright
remember we only have forty minutes
hmm
mm
hmm
hmm
thank you kate
yes
there we go
do it again
keep doing it until you get it in both you get it there you get it yours without that one and then you get it with both
yeah
this time it should come up both
okay
mm hmm
mm
hmm

mm
huh
it's a selection wheel
okay
okay


or call it a or call it a banana and have it in yellow
okay
mm hmm
mm hmm
hmm
hmm
mm 'kay
i wanna thank you all for all your presentations we have about ten minutes left in which time
we have to make some decisions on the remote control concepts um and
i think you all have been self stimulating of working together um we
need to come up with some specifics of the components um the materials
things like making the decision on the energy um and
the case and the interface type things so let's
mm
right
they want us to decide
what form of energy are we going to use
which the choices that we've discussed were pretty much battery kinetic or solar
um this is where kate's expertise comes in and our decision making will be a little bit guided by kate at this point the
you were saying that the kinetic would be useful that is you just have to move it some and you'd be able to
use it um as opposed to a battery that you have to either put it in a recharger or um
keep replacing the batteries um
or solar that you'd have difficulty with it if it's a dark day that it'll die on you and no way to do it
that's the day you wanna use the t v  um so what's our pleasure here what
would be the cost consequences of each of the three
okay
mm 'kay
what's the uh feelings of the group on the kinetic
hmm
hmm
so the consensus seems to be use the kinetic if it's at all possible
it costs
mm
mm
mm
hmm
yeah
thanks for the reminder for five minutes to finish thanks um the
next thing that they wanted us to do was look at chip on print
as a decision
oh
okay
what about the ca yeah oh the way we uh huh
oh okay
um what about the case
i think they're talking there about do we want wood plastic titanium or rubber and i think we've discussed not
having titanium one it's too expensive um and second it won't do this double um
curves um we've sort of eliminated wood we said plastic or rubber what's the pleasure
what about you
cover uh huh
plastic inside
hmm
okay
um the next part they want is the user interface concept i'm sorry to push you but we only have a couple minutes to finish with
okay and it says interface what type and what supplements
okay um
that's that
um this is gonna sound weird but the next meeting starts in thirty minutes whew
and they actually want a look and feel design user interface design you can look and see this
as well as i can marketing they want product evaluation oh oh my
i'm sorry
oh okay sorry about that missed that one
this ought to be fun trying to get this thing to work ah ta da
ah
yes because i can't even see mine next meeting starts in thirty minutes
these are the individual actions yeah right um the look and feel
design is for kate uh steph gets the user interface design
you get product evaluation um the two of you get to play
with a pla modelling clay um to do a prototype uh and everybody gets
individual instructions in the usual way anything else we need to do
go to it
and that's the end of this meeting
that's for her benefit
just just carry on
mm hmm
mm hmm

sorry i'm glad to see the marketing budget is being so well spent on




i think that's a good idea don't you
yeah i i think we're gonna have some trouble when we get down to the component design on this spongy is gonna be difficult i'm afraid
yeah i mean basically we can make these things out of wood titanium plastic or rubber i suppose rubber is the closest to spongy yeah
i was thinking titanium myself
yeah w w would it be helpful if um i described the components a bit because i think it would give you um maybe bring this discussion back to earth of what we can actually physically do

right well i i i think some of this um you're gonna be a little disappointed with some of the things i have to tell you but i'm afraid this is the real world so um
i've been looking at the the basics of how these devices actually have to work in order to operate
and i've had some discussions with the ma manufacturing division who have told me what's actually available
you know what the current state of the art in components is and some of the exciting new things they've got but i'm
not sure that it's quite what you want um now this isn't a very good overhead but this is just
to show you this is the innards of a remote control um i really need a pen
or something but uh does my mouse work no um oh yeah can you see my little mouse pointer right
this is this is the a a a remote that's been opened up and that's the the back
of the interface
and this is a push button one so you see these little little buttons here they're little rubber rubber buttons
that go through onto the the board at the back and they push these buttons here
um and we that's the basic construction that we've got to got to accommodate
we got to have something that pushes the little buttons that um talk to the chip that encodes the message
that sends the the message to the receiver
so um i wan i wanna go through not not just addressing the um
uh the the points that you made sarah but um doing my presentation in the order i wrote it
so first of all um i wanna talk about what possibilities we've got for the energy source um we can have your
bog standard double double a  batteries in a replaceable um little compartment
we can have a hand sorry a wind up yeah which i think
is quite an interesting concept for a sorry for a remote
control but i it maybe is doesn't quite go with the um the fruit and veg
um one that one that i think is quite interesting is the kinetic energy source where um
you you actually get the energy by moving the device which is quite a ni a nice and neat one you have to it means that if it's sitting there for a long
time it probably won't work but you have to sort of throw it between your hands every now and then it'll work or we we had talked about solar power
but i thing that we agreed that that's not so good in the dark
now i'm afraid this is the options we've got on on the case it can be made of plastic rubber wood
o if you like or titanium
um and the nearest we've got to st to spongy there i guess is rubber but um
i'm gonna come back to the advantages of titanium and basically it can have a flat surface a curved surface or a double curved surface but i think if we wanna use standard components we're gonna have difficulty with anything much beyond that
okay what does the interface look like um well push button that's that's the one we're all familiar with
um we can have scroll buttons and the the scroll button can incorporate a push
so you can have it like on a mouse where you can use it to go up and down change volume or channel or something like that and push
to
select something um you can have multiple scroll buttons um this is maybe getting a little bit
complicated but um it's it the technology is there and we can also incorporate an l c d  display in
the remote but this will increase the cost
um the electronics that actually makes the device work we've basically got three simple regular advanced
and the price goes up as we choose each of this if we want the nice cheap one the simple then we can only have
push buttons all the other fancy interface designs go out the window i'm afraid um
pay a little bit more for a regular chip and you can have scroll buttons if you want the advanced
chip it obviously costs more but it that's what you need if you want the l c d  display
and the manufacturing devision tell me that they have recently developed um sample sensor sample
speaker devices now i don't know what that is but i think they think it's quite important and
we might want to incorporate it somewhere um ou our real expertise is in push buttons i have
to say but maybe you think that's old technology and well i i
think we've got two options we can either go for a really cheap model keep all of the costs down um which means
a flat plastic case with an ordinary battery and simple push buttons or we can have something that looks a bit
nicer i think it um won't necessarily l uh look like a pineapple but um
that may or may not be a good thing sorry
um but it could have an l c d  screen and it could have multiple scroll buttons and it could have the the
company's new development of the um sample sensor and speaker
so thank you

yeah i'm afraid i don't have that information available um
manufacturing didn't actually give attach any prices to any of this i'm afraid
yeah mm hmm
banana
we we could we could do um a double curved rubber one which would allow um say a banana but um unfortunately i see from my notes that if we do that we have to have a push button as the interface we can't do anything fancier

yep



i if you do f  uh f n  f  eight again it's it'll
i think it yeah you you will do an

hmm
hmm
yeah
yeah i'd i'd certainly support that idea
it's difficult to make fancy shapes in it as well we can't for example have a double curved case in titanium unfortunately

and the the having the the the screen on the television screen i think is a good idea 'cause um otherwise we're we're putting up the price not only for putting building the l c d  in but for the electronics as well
there is that
do you want scroll buttons in that as well
mm hmm
right
yeah i think i think that's a g nice clean design it's playing to our strengths which are in push button technology
yeah
but we can implement it with simple push buttons which is much cheaper
in fact
oh that's really nice
hmm
mm we we could actually do it in rubber instead of plastic if you'd rather if you feel if you like the spongy
hmm
yeah
yeah
yeah

mm
oh unfortunately i don't have costing information i i in terms of workability i i think the the two front runners are the standard battery or the kinetic but i'm sorry i don't figures on the difference in cost
and and how much you do have to keep it moving 'cause i'm conscious that watching t v  can be quite a sed sedentary activity
yeah
true yeah m more more environmentally friendly

oh right okay i'd that that's something i maybe should have covered um
chip on print is just a manufacturing technique um and i would certainly recommend it i think because i'm not sure i have an alternative
i i it it's just the way that the the the uh th the way it's ac it's actually built and you you print onto the circuit board like you might print onto paper

well if if sarah's keen on a spongy feel the the rubber that we're talking about is the same as you have in those little stress balls so it's yeah
yeah i'd i'd need to talk to manufacturing again about whether that's actually possible but i agree it's uh sounds like a nice idea if it is

i should i should r

which i think technically is just push button and uh i'd certainly support that that that brings the cost down quite a lot and it's something that we're an ex the company's an expert on


you know i think the the company's s next project should to design a better overhead device that switches immediately

yeah
yes
yep
yeah
right







yes



so when your dad's sitting there overriding your decision going no we're gonna watch this you can bring out your own remote and be like zap no we're gonna watch this

yep
and as for
as for um well budgeting as well if we're gonna have lots of different interchangeable
components is this to the market
i was thinking titanium i was thinking it's just i have been influenced by pictures of ipods and they're also minimalist and shiny
yeah but it's kind of pointless isn't it
yeah
let's delegate
yeah maybe or
i think possibly it might be more useful if kate went next
um
you can even have them in different flavours as well so that if you just wanna sit there and chew on the remote it could be like pear flavour yeah scratch and sniff

a wind up



bear bear in mind it has to be the colours and styles of the company so what i had been thinking was something chunky and yellow and plastic with black buttons with a logo on it
but um
i i don't know how important that is to keep it exactly the colours of the real reaction company it's just what i'd understood we'd be doing that's before i heard about all this hot tips about the future fruit wise
shall we wait 'til i've 'til i've showed you what well my extensive presentation on what sort of interfaces are available
you did seem to include just in more detail what i've got though so so mine's a bit pointless
right
f n  and f  eight did you say
i don't have it on mine though
should i do it again
right then i don't actually have a huge amount of different information then what kate says just
that my method was to look at the well my my inspirations which was a big collection
of lots of different models of remote controls and other things that use a similar
sort of thing including m p  three players uh
like you know hi fi remotes not just television and these things uh having a think about the feature of ea the features of each ones
um what functions we actually need and then how to group and arrange these on the actual
the actual plastic or rubber hand held piece uh i've been especially interested in the ipod style scroll wheel which
well i couldn't find a the picture of the ipod w only linked to a web browser so i couldn't copy and paste it
but it had a similar thing to this thing on the right it has uh scroll wheels
without without a display but they they scroll like a computer mouse
so i was thinking that uh um a really simple
a really simple interface with just a couple of scroll things on it um and then instead of a display the display could appear on the television screen
like i guess an existing
sky or cable one does like you know you press enter and it comes up with what's showing on that channel at the moment and you can do you can scroll along and it'll show you what's on in the next half hour and you scroll up and you can see what's on the other channels while you're watching
the same channel on the screen
uh but i'm also equally taken with this chunky plastic kiddie remote
um which is really nice and fun and good to hold and nice big easy buttons to press but still quite simple and quite cost effective so
what seems kind of ideal for me would be to just have
a fairly simple uh not fancy but not totally minimalist i mean just
pretty simple plastic probably i was thinking yellow and black just because that's the company's colours
with very very few buttons but that would correspond to a screen that would appear on the
television screen like you know just small along the bottom instead of instead
of having the ipod style display screen on the actual remotes which is far too expensive
and when you've got a screen sitting there in front of you you might as well have it appearing uh on the screen in front of you it doesn't obscure much
of the actual picture you're watching
and so on that you can just much in the same way as an existing
sky remote scroll along scroll up and down and uh
and i definitely support uh the use of plastic and or rubber
i mean titanium would be great but i think it might be a bit too expensive and too
kinda spacey if we're k trying to keep it
colourful and slightly organic then i think titanium's too
futuristic
yeah
whereas a plastic's so cheap and easy and mouldable and everything else
uh then
and it's a little bit pointless as well i think like when when when you've got when you've got the screen there it doesn't have to be anything fancy just a little menu showing yeah a menu you go into one menu and then it can have your different options whether you wanna change the settings or the
you know your information about programme that's on at the moment i don't think that's to taxing to uh
s engineer um
but as for actually arranging them let me go back to the
to the picture of the kiddie one
and i quite like it 'cause it's just smooth and hand held and it's got these easily reachable buttons that quite nicely uh spaced out so something a bit like that with
buttons arranged in a
kind of circle up down left right
i i was thinking not actually scroll like a like mouse scroll but you know a i can't quite d uh describe it you see
on the one on the right down at the bottom is the mouse yeah see where the mouse is like this s style thing where you c have up down left and right
and enter in the middle so you pick your menu and then your different options and when
when you click on each one it you can go into a new menu for that i'm getting a bit uh specific here
really we'd have to use something to show you but
if i don't think i can get it up on the screen ah here we go right
well the ipod spinning wheel is uh really complicated it does scroll but it is hugely complicated what else have we got
them they're terrible but they all have this this feature of this uh
it's not quite a scroll wheel but
it's a kind of selection in this circle which i think is a really good idea
yeah like up down left and right
which is good and then and then
yeah so i mean either a channel up and down volume up and down
next appearing programmes up and down uh and then also when you get
into the different menus on the screen it's got your things like settings and contrast up and down so
all you really need is these four buttons with the enter in the middle
and that's it
look at look at this one
almost impossible to misplace or l or lose might take up your whole living room
possibly yeah
that also is possible
just
uh just something else i need to bring to your attention is have you have you seen these on a remote this
is actually the volume up and down but they both say v  on them which
when you first look at it you expect that to be the down because it looks like a downward pointing
arrow but it's actually the v  to indicate that it's the volume so
uh we do need to avoid little ambiguities like these
but we wouldn't have a specific volume up and down if we're having the scroll wheel then it's gonna double up as all the other up and down functions
but then that's complicated
it sounds great i've never come across it before but it sounds fantastic sounds like it could be g a really good economical it would make the whole thing a lot lighter more convenient
yeah 'cause it's really a quite attractive thought isn't it it's like yeah a good selling point
but it does depend how much
i mean how much it costs and how much more development and research it needs
do your exercises while you're watching the t v 
yeah that's what i was thinking as well

do you not think it might need
like a kind of
a hard plastic inner shell with the actual delicate workings inside and then a kind of spongy
yeah s thick spongy cover so it feels like the whole thing's spongy but actually you're not damaging anything by squeezing it
because i mean you could just get carried away with the with the tac
yeah well you do get a bit carried away with things that are tactile you just wanna stroke them and squeeze them and
just copy the one on the left no um a scroll
well like four buttons up down left and right with enter in the middle that will correspond to a menu on the screen
yeah i'd like push buttons with
so push buttons
no it's still it's still plugged in on mine actually
now it's gone again
oh yes
great
i don't think so
play doh
i respond to either no worries
okay first thing i want to address is um one of the points that florence brought up which was
uh current cost of the competition devices similar to the ones that stephanie uh showed us
and and they're uh twenty to sixty euros depending on uh
branding some of them that have a higher brand recognition are on the more expensive end but i think
that with the current um price that we're searching for we're well within even on the lower end
of the uh of the market but i'm going to move on to more interesting um
more vibrant things
so i investigated the remote control market in greater detail and my uh the theme of what i was to work on was uh trend watch
and


i know that you all are a distance from cutting edge marketing research so you know i'm just gonna try to cloak it in really professional terms here what's hot fruit and veg
spongy and this is all over the catwalks paris milan and i'm talking about clothing
furniture shoes this is really interesting change
from past years because it is much more organic um some would say approachable
and i think if we're to refashion our view of what we want in a remote
control we should perhaps think about incorporating technologically interesting
fabrics
and some of the bold colours into a simple
handset so i also did a little research on um
what again are the most important priorities in uh decision making about uh purchasing
fancy functional is out and f the fancy and that's exactly the
term i'm i'm thinking polished elegant you know kind of
innovative but a cut above this is twice as important as the next finding which is technologically innovative
this is interesting 'cause i think in the last meeting we were talking about technology as being so important but maybe what's
innovative is having it simple with um with uh technologically
superior fabrics or uh you know designed in interesting substances
ease of use again pretty low i mean it's the top three but each of the uh fancy
and technologically innovative are far more important so
i think we should cloak the streamlined remote control device in a series of fruit fruit themed sleeves
y yeah you know
exactly
exactly i was thinking though that instead of having something uh
like patterned you know so you know something similar to a summer dress you know it would have like fruit and veg is that we actually
make these spongy they could be ini initially i thought we could start with
kind of um fruit that would suit kind of uh a long
uh hand held so banana pineapple and pear um it could actually the sleeve
could take up a lot of the development and the remote control we'd just need to get reductionist
on it they could be interchangeable they're spongy that goes back to ergonomic and
the youngsters love 'em fun for the whole family everyone can have their own so what we're talking about is
changing
this concept everyone has a t v  remote but then we add in the fact that they could each have their own individual fruit that's what's hot on the catwalks so this is my
this is what i'm thinking
y yeah but i think i think what this would allow is perhaps a person in the family who had the most opinion
about it we all need a remote but the person who is really perhaps active in
personalising i'm thinking the teenager the someone fifteen to thirty five would go out and get this additional thing
the same way as you mentioned that people would get the cell phone covers
yeah w and plus i think

uh yeah
yeah
yeah so this is an idea and i i you know this is exactly what the research has uh has shown so i really open this up to uh any other feedback this spongy fruit and veg
thanks
alright
i i just have my ear to the market guys
is spongiest yeah that would add
mm hmm

they are and they they would fulfil the uh first um priority which is fancy i think many of us would associate those with fancy something else we could do is uh
call it something that's fruit and veg
oriented we could call it uh
the name
well it would be uh a a very simple product that would have a spongy sleeve that would be interchangeable so
that you know that might be
and then we could keep it titanium
yeah or s or smelly scratchy
uh well i was really thinking a lot about the i  uh the imac kind of gel gem tone it's hot on the streets guys





mm
hmm
hmm
hmm
hmm
mm

that sounds good any idea you you mentioned that there would be a cost difference um do you have any idea if if this could if the fancy model could be done in twelve euros fifty
hmm because you know what i'm being quite serious when i say that that um the things i mentioned
are hot but i think the important thing might be to choose
one you know if if what you're telling me is is um some of these things aren't just f aren't feasible maybe we could
something about naming we could call it you know blackberry
that's uh
alright well let's see then
yeah
yeah
but yeah i'm trying to streamline mine a little bit
yeah
hmm
yeah
mm
thank you kate
mm
oh i think um
florence resolved it by
f  eight again
maybe

mm
hmm
it's a duplication
mm hmm
mm hmm

to uh m make it
oh nice
um hmm
mm
wow

do you think with um
it seems that that uh you guys are quite keen on the plastic perhaps the something reminiscent of the child's remote do you think we could put it in a in a fruit colour
and have it abstract you know we could call like a fruit name but it would be a little more abstract
mm hmm
i'm just just throwing out ideas
yeah i'm thinking maybe we need to be a little bit more abstract if the
design constraints are so
mm hmm
mm hmm
nice good point
i've used kinetic in terms of watches and it's very very uh handy you don't even notice
um that it's there
it's
mm hmm
it could tie in with the fanciful design as uh you know throw the banana you know just gotta keep it moving
be
yeah
yeah
mm hmm but i could market that as a um as a a i was thinking actually a a cost saver down the road in terms of battery you know
mm hmm you know kind of the
that's exactly what i was thinking i'm sold
mm
kind of like an internal egg
yeah
and with sports on television
you know i su
then i'll just say i support either from a marketing point of view i support either decision that the designers make on that
no we can't actually
that's why i was looking over your shoulder
mm
sounds good
that's really all i got guys
mm hmm
okay
i g yeah
time is it
okay lovely to see you all again um it's our conceptual design meeting
and it's starting at approximately fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes for this one again and so we'll
go just after three o'clock um okay our agenda
we're gonna do an opening i'm gonna review the minutes of the last meeting then we'll have your three presentations um
and then we'll have to make a decision on the remote control concepts and finally we'll close
so opening um these are our minutes from r the functional design we decided our target group is
the focus on who can afford it because we have international appeal and we said it's for all age groups different um functions of
it our main objectives were simplicity and fashion and s um in
specific functions are something to keep the remote from getting lost large buttons for the essential functions
a possibility for extra functions like a sliding a sliding piece and a long life battery
or a charging station
okay now three presentations i'd like to do it in this order first do the conceptual specification of components properties and materials um and then the conceptual specification of user interface and finally trend watching
mm 'kay
function f  eight it there we go
mm
hmm
mm

yeah i wonder
mm hmm just an interesting marketing kind of element
uh just a real quick question um the weight of these different elements have you no idea okay
mm hmm
mm hmm
okay
mm 'kay
thank you perfect
um if you made notes yourself you can put those on our um underneath our oh uh in your book then don't worry about that
'kay now we're um concepts concepts of user interface

yeah um this one's so much tighter than the other one
okay nope
there we go here you are
mm
okay
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm
i do think that um one of the important features for a remote is seeing a menu and seeing what's on um
and so like favourite channels is is applicable but i think th that you do need to have some kind
of function where it's um you have t you can see the title of the show or possibly a description of it
like i i know i use that often enough
well if it if it was a l  l c d  on th on the remote i don't know that you could f that you'd be able to see a
okay
okay 'cause that would be more specifically a digital box mm hmm
mm
okay now we're moving on to market marketing

eight
oops it's not plugged in quite in well enough
there we are
mm 'kay

s sweet

okay do we have any s some questions for this let's see um
um do you have any ideas how to possibly use these um how to how to use
a fruit or vegetable or um or the spongy material at all like could
we make a s like could we make a spongy remote it would be easier on the hands
it's kind of and then it we would have to find a way to protect like the chip and all that i dunno but
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
f for sure or maybe like
um couple main ones being like i dunno lemons or strawberries or something
could they be smelly
i don't know
or carrot shaped mm
like large button that's what i was thinking of yeah
might would you think you you do you think you'd be able to hold it 'cause i think the reason they're long is yeah
harder to push
i usually hold it in one hand maybe
but then the buttons would have to be very small don't you think
but i mean in order to get to all of them you know
they would have to be within a certain amount of space with each other
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
it's a scroll yeah it's a wheel
the one i have doesn't have the four on i like around it i don't think
mm
okay um we have we've about fifteen minutes left so i'm i'm gonna
continue with my pres presentation um i've one more slide before we close but in that slide is when we need to make decisions about this these kinds of things so i'll just bring that up and show you all
before we move on um
yeah and then like the the covers could be spongy latex wherea but the actual model could be titanium
ah hmm hmm hmm
okay um components concept energy chip on print
g
that's th th this is the agenda they gave me so can you just explain what that is real quick
mm hmm
i think it's awesome i think it's really cool

okay
if they're if they're really options
okay
um okay then we'll move on to the case
um oh bu i guess maybe if we decided on like a simple a regular or an advanced chip maybe
it would be nice for changing the volume but i don't know how useful it'd be for changing the channel 'cause you don't have control over numbers or
we have five minutes left for the meeting so
so have a scroll for volume
f
um
i think w well i think when we go on to the une userface we're gonna have to decide the interface we're gonna have to decide um whether we're gonna have a scroll or not
okay let's do case
i'm a little um i'm a little hesitant about it because i'm worried about protecting the stuff on the inside
um
yeah i would be more okay with like a titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone kind of thing
mm hmm
okay
mm hmm
okay
ge o
okay so we uh we do want latex
okay
latex um and probably in colours maybe fruity vegetable colours
fruity colours okay um let's go to the ufe user interface then we'll come back to the chip i suppose
well we don't really know what the difference is right
yeah
um okay interface the type and the supplements
so push or scroll right or both
mm hmm
and if we had a sc an on screen um kind of thing that you could scroll through like you can use your buttons to scroll
through things i think that yeah for channel surfing i think a scroll an
actual like an ipod's kind of scroll thing would be too fast i dunno
mm hmm is that okay with you how you feeling
mm hmm
it might be cool enough
okay so we're gonna go with um type pushbuttons and then supplements how are we gonna do that
um i assume that's what else we're gonna like h ha the um the additional buttons we can use
so we're gonna have like a menu button so that we can access on screen things then okay um so we're doing an on screen menu that we can scroll through
pre set channels and then we're gonna need um numbers one through zero right
well but in order to pre set a cha oh i guess you can just hold it down when you get to one when you're scrolling through
mm hmm okay um finishing the meeting now um our next meeting starts in thirty
minutes um you each have things to do look and feel design user interface design product evaluation and you two are going to work together on
a prototype using modelling clay you'll get specific instructions from your personal coach
um did we decide on a chip let's go with a simple chip okay
we are done thank you everyone
oh i di these are already in our shared folder so
mm yeah
okay
that would be me
alright
well
alright
um i'm very excited by this one actually guys i uh had a lot of fun
doing it components design this is where you look at what
does it take to make a remote control and what should we make our specific remote control out of
um so we need to examine each element separately but we're designing
a full thing so you wanna keep it integrated as a whole the main elements of remote controls in
general and therefore ours as well are the case the buttons the circuit board with the chip and the battery these
are all things that we had sort of addressed before but i'm gonna take each one a little bit separately here as we figure out what
they should be made of and what they should look like
the case uh the options that i've gotten from headquarters about what we can do um there's there's the shape
of a case we could do a flat sh a flat case a curved case or maybe even a double double curved case
i haven't seen any pictures of what this exactly looks like yet just keep that in mind but these are the options that we have from manufacturing
and we can make our case out of plastic the m the main base will be plastic but we have all these sort of fashion
and technological elements we can add in wood latex titanium rubber or other coloured types of plastic
that would be our case um buttons for buttons we have um pushbuttons which is what
real reaction uses the most often but we also have scror scroll wheels which can have integrated pushbuttons
or we could go all high tech and have an l  l c d  screen um circuit board and chip
we can have a simple one a regular one or an advanced one depending on what our other needs are and then
battery i think is where things get most exciting we're talking about long life batteries here um we can we can have your
sort of basic double a  batteries but we also have these options of um using a kinetic battery
like are used in high tech watches where you just have to move it a little bit to get it to power up
um so simple movements like pushing buttons would recharge the battery or a solar battery although there are slight um complications with solar batteries as in we can't use a latex case if we have a solar battery
or um something they only described as the type of battery you find in torches from about fifty years ago flashlights not quite sure what that is but that's the description that i received so that's what i'm passing on to you so those are our options
um personal preferences that i was thinking through here's what we've been talking about
all through fashion and simplicity so if we're going for fashion in our cases i think that
what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved or a double curved case probably with a variety of design
elements maybe titanium maybe some wood we're gonna have to investigate that better when i get specifics of the actual
materials but that's sort of what i have in mind and we wanna go for simplicity probably pushbuttons but
i'm sort of intrigued by the idea of a scroll scroll wheel if anyone has anything
any ideas on that i mean i know the ipods and things right now have touch scroll um
buttons which are exactly like what they're describing so that might be something we wanna look into and i'm really intrigued by the idea of a
kinetic battery solar i don't think would be such a good idea because how often are you sure
that your remote control will get a certain amount of light but this idea of the kinetic that you don't have to replace
and that a simple just shaking it around will make it work i think that that m would be a very interesting thing
but i think we'd also wanna go for e a simple chip or regular chip to keep our costs down uh
we really only need a regular or advanced chip t if we're gonna start using an l c d  so i think we want
to be aware of not making things overly t
technological if they don't need to be 'cause that'll keep our manufacturing price way down that's what i have for options um i'd appreciate anyone's input but that's what i'm seeing for the future of the the look of this thing
i'm not sure i haven't received any specific
visuals of this yet
this is what i'm sort of
yeah i'm not sure but i'll let you know as soon as i get any pictures
i know if we do have a double curved case it can't have any titanium in it
but the titanium they were quite they're marketing quite hard to us as being used in the space programme so that could be quite interesting space age remote
just all things to keep in mind yeah
that's about all i have to do guys i hope i didn't go through that too quickly
yeah n no idea no idea
um
i'm assuming
that a kinetic battery isn't gonna take up that much weight and that a tita titanium is very light i know um but other than that's really basic i mean that's all i have gotten so far alright
any other questions
no okay
i have save this in the uh shared projects if anyone wants to look and i have c considerable notes on the topic as well if anyone needs any more information uh
just in my notebook but if anyone has any specific questions don't hesitate to email me or something
alright uh i guess i can
i know
g oh geez


hmm
hmm
so you'd be advocating an l c d  then
okay
mm hmm
right
right
okay
mm hmm
'kay
well
are you are you tak
yeah
no i think i think we're talking menu like contrast and tuning the v c r  or something if i've understood you correctly rather than menu as what's on
oh good point
yeah
no signal
oop there we go
okay





mm

that there's all kinds of scope for imagination in that one though

if it's latex if it's latexy
um mean
an uh i if th my understanding of a latex case is that it's in fact hard to protect stuff inside but that it's covered with the latex which is spongier and softer on your hands
it's there's something to be said i mean we we got that thing earlier from you about um not wanting it to
r  r  repetitive stress injuries and things and and
yeah something grippable i mean we don't we don't we don't wanna go spongy maybe yeah
mm hmm
yeah i think that given the list of materials i w i was forwarded it's that seems doable
could we go in fruit and vegetable colours we could colour co ordinate them li
the buttons could be fruit shaped oh
well it's quite easy to s shape thing like carrot isn't it or maybe the buttons could be shaped like different fruits
be yeah it'd be harder to f bu uh buttons i think it'd be harder to press button
um
i
yeah that's ts how i tend to do it
no just thumb sized jus
yeah
that's true
right
i when i'm when i'm pressing buttons on my ipod that's how i do it hold it and press the four yeah
yeah or in and use my thumb or my pointer finger on the touch scroll wheel
yeah
it wel well yeah it would i mean each version of it has been a little bit different but
oh yeah you had one of the in between ones when they weren't doing that anymore
ts and you press the centre button that's that's your all purpose select button right there
since it's the one in the centre that's not marked yeah
yeah
uh uh t
yeah
hmm
yeah
yeah i think an l c d  screen might be good in theory but not as useful in practice
yeah
right
um
oh we probably have to get going don't we
'kay
could
could we uh could we have changeable covers like for your mobile in different fruit and vegetable colours yeah

exactly
and you could co ordinate with your house or whatever all these options
ooh
oh
yeah
mm options

uh hu oh oh yes right i had sort of skipped over that hoping it wouldn't get
be necessary but um
alright so um decisions what the okay deci decisions on energy i'm thinking is based on the battery um i dunno what do people think about this kinetic battery idea
am i
yeah
yeah
right i haven't gotten any yeah any more information on cost other than it's more expensive than a regular battery but um but if we're using a an i a cheaper chip then it'll even out i think
um circuit boards
um yeah i got a whole bunch of information on how circuit boards are produced they're they're thin fibreglass with copper
wires etched on to them and di i think they're quite easily printed on by machine which is chip
on print is where the machine prints on the wires and solders it all together for us i don't really know what to tell you as far
as decisions i wasn't really given any options i was just given that this is how they're done
um
yeah i can't can't really tell you i can i can tell you a whole lot about how it works but i don't know any decisions on
yeah
i'm sorry i did f
yeah
right well okay here's the here's the thing on the chips that i that i got um simple regular advanced chip on print the chip on print includes an infrared sensor so we don't have to worry about that
um

'kay the pushbutton if we're gonna have pushbuttons they require a simple chip but a scroll wheel requires a regular chip and an l c d  requires advanced do we want a scroll wheel or do we just want pushbuttons
oh
yeah th it'd be it'd be handy for going through if there was an on screen menu of your channel choices than you can scroll down on the scroll
yeah
yeah
yeah
hmm
f or for all those secret functions
when you get on the on screen menu of all your functions that your remote could do for you without the buttons and you could have a scroll wheel to go through those menus
right so we could either go with a simple or a regular chip depending and maybe we could table that decision for later
i don't know
okay
well let's think about that while we talk about the case
uh i'm kinda liking the idea of latex if if spongy is the in thing
okay
uh yeah everything i've
n oh wha what i've what i've seen just not related to this but of latex
cases before is that there's uh like a hard plastic inside and it's just covered with the latex
not too thick a layer of latex just enough to be grippable like bike handles or or anything that you've seen like
that the inside is hard i don't think we need to worry about protecting the circuit board i think that that's done for us
yeah
yeah
oh and we want a curved case yeah or a double curved
yeah okay we don't really know what the difference
good point
yeah i say pushbuttons at least unless we get any information but
i have no idea how much more expensive a scroll wheel is than than a pushbutton but it's gotta be some more expensive
so i think it might be better to put our money into the stuff like the kinetic battery
and the cool case
because
yeah
oh
alright
so what are what are our buttons gonna be on off
so like one through five or
no
mm
yeah up down

ooh
simple chip
okay cool
clay
yep
uh huh don't think so
jess
alright so i'm gonna describe the the concept of the user interface of this des device
um we've talked about uh the two essential properties of the user interface we want it to be simple and we want it to be fashionable
um
other we've also got to remember that this is a device that serves as a useful purpose uh we want people
to be able to use it s as a remote control so we need to determine what the essential functions
of the d of the device are and make sure that we include that we've included all of
those and that we actually end up with a device that is going to be useful to people
we have a number of different choices for a design concept um and s that's
that's something that that i'll show you some examples of um but essentially we need to choose
how how is this device going to work how how what kind of model is there going to
be for user interaction with this device uh once we've chosen a a concept for
it we can then design the features around the concept making sure that we get all the essential functions
in the device and uh the extra functions and the more advanced features
and of course we also have to make it look cool
so basically that's what we don't want m we don't want lots of buttons uh complicated features we want something that looks nice and simple
here's a a fairly simple device this is an an ipod from apple um i think the main
thing to notice about it is it just has four buttons it's very minimalistic in its design
uh you use these four buttons to m to move around a range of settings on the small l c d  screen
um the thing i like about this is that
it's very very quick to access the main features uh you can just about make out uh that
the button three buttons are uh previous track next track and play pause they're
the main the main features of the ipod the things you will use a all the time um then
if you want to do anything more advanced you go into the little menu on the l c d  screen and you use the buttons just to
scroll around and and find the more advanced features that you want so i think that's that's a good a good kind of model
that we could have um
here's a another example this is uh it's an interesting idea and i think
i it looks pretty cool um it's certainly got novelty value uh it's nice and colourful
it's nice and bright uh it's also something that you can kind of feel your way around the buttons
are are different shapes and and you can sort of yeah if you're watching t v  in the dark or whatever you can
work out which button's which and basically yeah it's ith it's fun
so i i like i like this idea of just having buttons for the features that you use most often
so you'd need a few buttons to select your favourite channels i mean most people when they watch t v 
they have two hundred and fifty channels on their t v  and they watch of 'bout four of them at the most so you
have buttons for your favourite channel changing the volume which is something you do all the time when you're watching t v  and the button to switch
it off in case you get bored
um other features things like adjusting the brightness tuning the t v  uh
i don't know what else you do with a t v  um but these are these are all necessary functions
uh you can't have a t there's no point having a television that you can't tune or that you can't set the contrast
so we need to find a way of including these somehow um and one other suggestions i'd make is to in
is to include in a menu system a bit like on the ipod
so we'd either have a small l c d  display on the device itself or
uh have a dis a menu display that comes up on your television and can b be controlled through the device and that
would allow you to access access the advanced features uh whilst keeping a very small
and simple set of buttons for the features that you use most often
i think that's that's one way to go yes um i mean there are there are advantages and disadvantages
if you if you have an l c d  display it's it's nice because it's it it lets
you just sort of sit there and st and control your television from your armchair
there are disadvantages an an l c d  display would have to be quite small 'cause we're we're i
well we're i assume we're gonna be making quite a small device um it would also have to have uh
a kind of backlighting in it 'cause you ten you tend to watch t v  in the dark but you need to be able to see your l d d  l c d 
display
the alternative is to have a an on screen display on your television that you control through your remote control uh
a bit like a bit like how they have these um digital boxes where you you press the buttons and it comes up with your
this thing of watch lo what's on each channel i mean that that's also a good idea it's it can it does have it's
problems as well if you've got a small t v  and you're sitting on the other side of a room it's hard to read the little text that comes up
uh but that's a that's a design decision that we can make
yeah
yeah
yeah that that would be one of the features yes
but it's it's it's something to bear in mind is that if we put a display on the remote control
the c uh communication is one way so you can't have the televisions and information back to the remote control at least i don't think you can um i'm not sure
is that going on okay
uh that should be alright actually







a kind of thing that
yeah
yeah yeah
i is it supposed to be shaped like a vegetable uh like uh i dunno like uh carrots or something
maybe or
kind of like a potato
yeah
depends when you when you use a remote do you press the buttons with your thumb usually
or your fingers
or maybe you want something that's shaped like a mobile phone so you you hold it in one hand and you press the buttons with your thumb
yeah
maybe but if you've only got like four or five buttons anyway then it's it's not so much a problem perhaps
so you hold it in one hand and you press you press the buttons with your thumb and
and you find that works quite well
is that the button on an ipod is it what is it is it just four buttons or is it li more like a scroll thing
right
oh i see right yeah oh okay yeah that's quite a good design
yeah
i think it could be difficult in practice yeah also z yeah 'cause you would be z looking down at the l c d  screen than back up at your t v  and people don't wanna do that
like to make it different fruits
yeah it's possible
i think maybe th the packaging it should be like a lemon and the the packaging is like the peel so instead of opening the box you just kind of peel it and the remote control's inside
don't know

yeah um i think it's good as as long as we consider the the cost and the uh how reliable it is but as far as i know the technology is good
al all circuit boards are pretty much the same i think uh it's fairly fairly standard
um
i don't think we ne really need the scroll whe wheel i mean it might be nice for changing the volume uh but
i don't think it would really work
yeah you really need buttons for changing a channel
yeah
yeah
yeah
i think yeah i think a scroll wheel would be nice but it's not necessary um
yeah
'kay yeah
yeah
yeah
um
yep um
and i think if we wanna keep our costs down we should just go for pushbuttons 'cause then we can have a
a simple chip and it's simpler it's it's cheaper to make pushbuttons than it is a scroll button
so in terms of uh in terms of uh economics it's probably better to have pushbuttons
yeah yeah it's uh it's it's fairly simple
yeah
yeah interesting
yep
uh what do you mean by supplements exactly
um
yep
yeah
um in
yeah
on off uh volume favourite channels uh and menu yeah yeah about yeah like yeah a bit like radio presets um
uh we wouldn't even need the numbers
i think maybe numbers seems is kind of old fashioned
yeah yeah you can just and you need some kind of i dunno sort of up down kind of button but the volume control could double for that for example
cool
yep
clay i wasn't expecting that
fourteen twenty six
is double curved like would be like two hands kind of thing
okay 'cause i'm imagining like double curved is like you know like two sides that curve and then like one curve would just be like a single vertical ish kind of looking thing but i've no idea
sounds good
thanks



wait but is that separate from what he was saying
should i plug that in

maybe it's just not is it on
ri what f  do you have to press five
i just keep pressing lots of 'em
well i don't know how relevant all of this gonna be if anything the that they gave me alright
oh yeah
okay so we're gonna look a little bit at trend watching basically
i was given um an executive summary that was a market investigation on
remote controls that was recently conducted and then also some fashion watchers in paris and milan
commented on some things that are gonna be going on this year so first um they
had people they ranked um the important aspects of r remote controls and right now
i d they're saying that currently there's a functional look and feel preference but that really
over the next year it it that's gonna be switching to fancy look and feel remotes so that just
goes back to
the whole desire of our c real reaction company wanting to focus on fashion and so
even though we're stressing when we're talking we've all been talking about this like simplicity and easy to use idea
they're sort of wanting us to remember that the number one thing for everyone is that it's fancy look and feel and as these are ranked
the top one is doubly important to the second one which is doubly important to the third one so just to take that
weight into account
the second thing that was mentioned as important was the technological innovations that would be like if we use something
like the space material or the l c d  screen things like that and then ease of use was the third most important whi
so really no matter what we need to focus the most on fancy look and feel according to this i
don't know how much we agree with that and then the fashion watch talks about that this year's top
trend for clothes shoes and furniture is fruits and vegetables
and tha that there's a preference for spongy tight material
and so that brings us to my personal preferences who wants a spongy remote or
one with fruit and vegetable padding personally i don't really think that i want one that's gonna
go out of style or go stale excuse the pun um in a year so
even though this is coming from us as you know trend watch market research i don't know how much of it we necessarily
wanna take away also considering that the d research b has been carried out by real reaction i'm a little
hesitant as to like how these questions may have been worded and if necessarily
this whole fashion to technology y edas ease of use is necessarily the right ranking personally
like i might reverse it but if we're working for this company then i guess no matter what we have to stress fashion the most but it
doesn't necessarily need to be a spongy material
yeah i don't have a lot of notes to share if you want them that pretty much sums it up so yeah
yeah what can i possibly enlighten on
mm hmm
yeah so something m m instead of a necess yeah grip i'm thinking grip more than like sinking
into your hands you know i and i think i'm envisioning more like you know the material that you have
when you sit on like a bicycle so that it doesn't hurt when you're sitting down for a long time like i'm imagining that sort of thing i don't know what th
that material's called

oh god

what about the idea of like a round remote instead of like a vertical up and down one like in terms of holding it like that's a f shape of a fruit just to tie it in a little
yeah
yeah 'cause otherwise your fingers can't move around but i like i
i love the idea of the wheel like the ipod 'cause th
it's like five 'cause there's one in the middle
i think why it would be good for us is 'cause like you could have the same wheel sort of effect for like channel flipping and then
the other one could be like for volume like just the idea of like those so few buttons for main things but then how you could go back to the menu
and like i dunno if we would want it on the screen there or on the actual t v  i kind of am wanting to say on the t v 
'cause if you're changing the brightness don't you wanna see it happening kind of and then you could
still have that available
mm hmm mm hmm
uh huh
if i get any more information of fruits and vegetables i'll let you know
well there we go the ipod packaging is me like was so that was like half the fun it's like the way it all comes all cute
lemons

yeah i mean it would
t totally take care of our problem of not wanting to change batteries
costs
but over time

yeah it's a
but if you c if you could scroll through the channels and then the volume would just be
and the volume would just be like the same way forward and backward as i'm just thinking like it would make it much like sleeker
sort of looking and otherwise no matter how may buttons we have we're gonna have like you know black with
red sticking out and th no it's gonna inevitably sort of start looking like those group of
sort of ugly ones that we saw stacked up
oh could it be hard and then something around it

i'm thinking curved of some sort
yeah and let's like see if we get anything else i mean i'm not like hard sold on the scroll wheel it's more just to give it a different kind of look but if it's gonna be in a latex type thing and that's gonna look cool then that's probably gonna have a bigger impact than the scroll wheel
like a radio type sorta situation
wow


your judgement it's is biased
so we are so
let's go for our detailed design meeting
so i will still play the role of the secretary and we'll have
um first the project presentation by our user interface
designer david jordan and our industrial designer baba
so we'll have to evaluate the uh your proposed remote control and um have an idea of the price that uh this thing will cost
and in case if we're we all agree on the fabrica of um building of this remote control
we'll evaluate the um production so
maybe i will let the our two designers talk about so their you have s oh
sorry oops
looks strange
okay

genetically modified mushroom i will say but keep on speaking
oh maybe i hope so
chan
yeah okay but don't touch don't destroy your prototype
everything's mushroom so we can call our remote control the mushroom
okay

oh
fruits and vegetables
vegetables mushroom is a vegetable
it's vegetable
so th it's something eatable

next slide

mm hmm
in the base in the basement in the basement and where is the solar solar cell
where is the solar cell
oh do you think it won't be it won't cris increase the price
okay we'll see after we will have first to so mister money what's your opinion according to this remote control

mm hmm
maybe if you change if you take the buttons out and maybe do things like that
it would be bet more like a lemon
yeah
looks like more fruit maybe a pineapple
and you know you have the
finger here with the buttons
it looks more like a pineapple sorry what's the use for that

and where is the voice recognition
okay
okay is it better like that looks okay let's say it's a pineapple now
it looks like a now you took it
it looks like a pineapple with cherry on top mm uh
seven is the ma the maximum
three i will say three
isn't it bitter like that
feasible
you said previously that you there's um microphone inside an
oh okay and you have the there's the technology inside that recognise simple vocal comments and you can turn it so maybe it's techno technologically innov innovative
we have tactile buttons
oh yeah
maybe two
two i would say two you agree
it's better like that isn't it
okay

oh ok i understand you take take the remote so and you can turn like
that to change the channel i think it's quite easy to so s zapping but maybe it will be too
fast
yeah you have a like that and so on
oh yeah
yeah but y but you have to go through all the channels if you want to go
mm hmm
yeah but when you're zapping you're changing from one channel to the other so you're passing through all the channels so
when you say i want to go to the channel number twenty that's you've decided to go to channel twenty so you can say channel twenty or
channel four because you really want to go on this channel but if you really want to to do zapping you you don't really
know what you want to do you can turn it just go through all the channels and maybe stop if there is something interesting
seems to be good
good choice mister david jordan
yeah what's what's this cherry
okay
yeah th you have the vocal commands
on off

most of the time you have the yeah it's a sleeping remote control
that's true w that why we have the solar ti yeah so three
do you agree three
and what's your opinion
it's not what you said previously previously you said that turning this was the fine
fine to coarse and from ten to ten channels here
okay
oh
yeah no no no you can't put it out it's just your turning from the base you need to have everything in hand if you want to turn you can't use it and turn it's impossible you need to put it on and turn
yeah but nobody would be able to take it in the pocket and bring it in the kitchen and say i've lost the remote control nobody would take it so nobody w will lost lose it

s maybe we can change from th
four easy to use four gonna say four
trois three

so th the project is accepted
but i d m i think that it will be good to do some more work
to transform this into a pineapple if you re we really want to have a
fruitful remote control
so uh mm mm mm
okay and we we had a project prototype presentation with the
evaluation so as we all agree to accept
under certain conditions the prototype we'll have look to the final
sh financial view
so we need to calculate the production cost as
i said in the first meeting we need to have so a remote control that would cost not more than twelve
and point fifty euros and if not if it's not the case y you would have to redesign
it so just have a look at the okay
here is the
excel
sheet so so it has the energy
source we have hand dynamo no we don't use that
we have battery right kinetic we don't have it i suppose but we have solar cells
um how many do y do you need solar cells do you think one would be enough or such as
as number of branches three so electronic
single simple chip on print just one would be necessary one
zero for the others
and sample sensor sample speaker
one
as we have voice recognition i think
so the case
okay just keep on going just to have an idea
well uh yeah but what what about case uncurved flat single curved double curved i think it's more like double curved
one
uh wood

uh do we need special colour y maybe two we have two special colours push button
okay
scroll wheel we don no
it it's more like integrated scor
yeah maybe two scroll wheel as we have the coarse coarse to fine scroll wheel
so no button supplements
okay
okay we i think we have problem
i think we s if we keep on adding things so we have to
maybe if w t if suppose if we change and we g put just one
has it changed
okay
yeah but we have you the the voice recognition no
okay
or it would be better
so do we need special colour
because we have red
red and yellow
i think so we need if we try to have a kind of
pineapple bee
yeah an but we have integrated scroll wheel with push dut button and i think this is one integrated scroll wheel push button so we'll we have only one
and push button so if we have all integrated i in the scroll wheel and push button it's uh
something flat
s uncurved yeah maybe not
yeah
mm nearly
maybe don't bat no battery only solar cells
i think there's a problem with the push push button we only need maybe just one just one
yeah so
yeah you will have so one button and s
scroll wheel with push button on it
so
so yeah it think we we've done good job as the cost is
twelve fifty e
yeah but it's under or equal it's not written sometimes it's under or equal

twelve fifty
yeah i think
i think yeah but it would i be interesting for our marketing team to make a lot of advertisement concerning these solar cells to be
yeah but it will be technologically innova innovative so so it's easy to use and powerful as the remote control a has only one button
easy powerful
so i don't think we need to redesign the p the product
yeah
so
now
so
so did you enjoy your clay modelling
yeah was it a nice way to create your remote control

and for the marketing guy
and new ideas about new products maybe wi which would be fashion and uh
and yellow


yes just lemon
squared

ah the lemon t v  with the pineapple remote control
oh that's interesting you could f we could do a kind of fruit collection of electronics things electronic device
maybe
yeah maybe la next year it will be insects
customable t v 
ah such yeah you've already said mobile phones yeah and following
mm
it's interesting maybe we can create a a line of uh t v  with uh a a tr
so i think the costs are within the budget we're just at twelve fifty
euros so
do you think you can celebrate your creation
oh thanks a lot thank you mister david jordan
the thing now is to to sell it

it's maybe a little bit expensive

maybe what you can do a test put it outside and if bees come it's really fruit
but don't put sugar in it it's not working
yeah but the colour i think the colour is more is most important because i i don't think you have ever seen something like that before for a remote control
yeah but we decided to have something yellow and red for the costs
so maybe we can just integrate it on th on one side the double r 
so we have the logo we have the colour and we have the fashion in electronics so we have the slogan too
yeah th no it's the it's the pineapple control remote control it's a pineapple now it has changed it's a pineapple pineapple
with cherry on top
will you buy one
try to okay uh
one thing i like is the shape because you know it's not like the uh the remote controls you can put in your pocket on uh in your jacket
i prefer the laser remote control no
oh maybe next if we decide to do something we'd can put light inside
yeah
i think it it would be interesting to just to see if we can if people will buy this one and maybe add some features to it after yeah
so
champagne mister baba
so
okay i will close this mm
so i think we have finished the designing and the evaluation of our remote control
and we have a nearly final product
final prototype right so thank you very much very productive
mm hmm so ready

sorry i i um i'm afraid
uh thi this remote control will stay a prototype
okay
yeah
yeah

okay
effectively one slide and maybe we can discuss everything
okay
yeah
uh
yeah yeah i'm sure
yeah that's true

yeah
yeah but it's not like really mushroom because you have uh you know uh like lemon shape you know centre is yellow and t d
to integrate you know yeah
i don't think i hope nobody will eat it you know to integrate the fruit aspect you know the the in
really but
fruit and vegetable so mushroom was a kind of you know uh
mushroom oh uh i'm not sure we can it's a veg a kind of vegetable but you know we we integrated them with different colour
i i think we take into account what you said about fruit and vegetable you know this you know very enlighted colours you know
and inspired colour and and very sophisticated material so
and so
so what we w what i can add is that you know he talk about what is outside so what is inside is what we dis what we talked before about you know the chip it is a low level chip and
you know we don't need to k you know wi the low level chips inside and you know the l c d  button and the i
the battery it is under it is in th in in the base yeah
in fact this this this this is a kind of you know revolutionary solar receptor that we can put outside
and i don't think so
but it it's might be okay so i it might be okay so


yeah

so four point three point five it means it's acceptable
oops
i think you have nice colours i don't the sha the bowl shape people like
is it really fancy
but it's you have the lemon aspect of this th this this thing
do don't do that please
i it's it's i this shape is a lemon like so
yeah
because i
less button

yeah but you don't have any button now
that's uh yeah is that that's a good idea so that's great that's great
i have no idea so
i have no idea what

if it is fancy or not
so we can we can say t
the colour is the colour acceptable
so the shape now
it's too much red in the basement
i will give i will
i'll gi
i'll give two or three three it's okay three three three is fine for me
what other
is it easy to use
ye uh
embedded
it's a micro array okay
oh yeah yeah
and i think you you've never seen a rou a round remote control so it is
i
w yeah but
i see you have microphone array embedded you have that's good and you have you know this ki this solar receptor that you know yes yeah
i think technically it's acceptable so
yeah
two yeah two it's it's fine so
most
eh for th the vocal command yes it's might be easy but it's just speaking you just need the command
as a principle

i think maybe if you he
if you hear some click
yeah it would
oh yeah that's difficult that's dif that's difficult
yeah but y how you need to know i
i think something that yeah
and you you can
i think you can if you have a scale so
yeah it's a bit difficult
i think b but the the vocal command is easy too you can say fifty and fifty it's okay so
uh yeah and y that's yeah
yeah
to see uh yeah uh
yeah
and but i'd
it is a turn off t turn off button maybe
yeah yeah yeah that's
that's very technologic so yeah
s but i di i didn't see where the t f the turn off t turn on turn off button so much activates maybe one of the
uh it's k on off yeah

yeah sleeping
to compensate yeah
easy to use it's very relative but three it's fine i think it's reasonable three
three f three for me it's o it's okay four or three maybe you can vote to see how many everybody gives and no and just take the mean
will you give
four
five
yeah so maybe if
yeah but y you know
you just push two button zero and and one and that's
are there some buttons okay

in fact on a flat place
you can
oh ye yes that's right
oh my god
yeah maybe maybe may it's the next prototype maybe we cou
four maybe four it's okay i'll put four
yeah four it's more reasonable
you can you can erase with this er yeah
yeah four it's more reasonable so
so it's nine nine over three oh yeah it's
it need maybe some wo further work but it's
yeah uh s yeah
might it might be fine
yeah b i think
yeah yeah

that's the finance
yeah
oh yeah

yeah we have battery
no um solar cells yeah
uh i think in each ball you have three three uh yeah three yeah three three solar cells
s s simple simple yeah yeah
mm one maybe yeah
yeah yeah yeah
is it
is sh it
wooden

is yes a wooden pl i and that's there's no wood so plastic just only i think
double curve yeah double curve
one you have
but it's yeah a a rubber uh
yeah yeah y y yeah yeah
five
i think that this will be like a scroll wheel actually y you tu you turn you turn it so
yeah true yeah yeah yeah
okay yeah yeah scr
l c  display maybe interface
it's okay fine
yeah it was stage one so
so
i think you can transform the wood into plastic maybe because uh it seems that this can be yeah wood into plastic and it it should be fine
yeah red and yellow fancy


one
i can remove maybe f you have five with push buttons so we can just i dunno try to modify some of them to have yeah
double curve we can transform the double curve into single c yeah f some
single curve single curve should be fine so
oh what

it's it's a bad idea so
two one that's fine
that's fine one s
one scroll wheel so and the vocal chord it's fine it
i th it's fine

it's fine
it's under or equal it's fine so
it's fine twelve fifty uh
the solar cells r is i is it
yeah to be able to si to sell it
yeah with mi
it's it is really really uh really very very expensive though
maybe if uh okay
yeah yeah

it's easy to use it's very easy to use
no
we've done it with it is under the if it was low high or so
so
so what are we going to do with this project evaluation
okay okay it's fine

yeah i think i find it really funny and amazing and interesting to go through all the process to from the beginning to the end
and designing looking at the chips the solar cells and uh and it was very informative for
yep
okay okay
yellow i think you can think about a yellow t v  now after a fruit t v  or i dunno it can be an interesting i don't know
yeah just a lemon t v  it'd be yellow lemon
it's flat uh
yeah that's right it's really boring yeah
yeah

yeah that's that would be really interesting actually
device devi
the fruit yeah
yeah it's
but i think it's good to follow the f flow and you know make it now and after you know if the people change their mind you change also the product
yeah
yeah yeah that's a yeah yeah
we can think about t v  with you know where you can change you know the aspects o like for the cell phones you know
yeah you customise it every ti so every ti if people change you just change the appearance and y y you can keep
yeah you can keep the global appearan
the mood of persons the fashions uh
we int

yeah t v  yeah
a t v  for autumn and a t v  for winter you know so it's
so what i and do w is it okay
yeah the pr at

yeah but i think f it's really a celebrating object so it's yellow and very a very ha it's very happy so uh it's it's a pr it's like yeah

yeah right go and sell it goo and good luck so

it should be fine
wh really it should be it should be fine you know actually s


i i think i like the the colour a the colour are very good so actually so
it's perfect and
i p is th y the the yellow ball thing that
uh f like y we can we can put some uh double r 
okay yeah yeah that's actually good idea so

it's not a mushroom it's a pineapple remote controls
yeah pineapple remote remote control
oh that
oh unid uh unidentified remote control so
that's that's pineapple remote control i think it's fine

yeah yeah i will try i'll try i can hel i will try versions so to see how easy easy to manage
yeah i always lose my yeah so so i if it is a universal one i can use it with my t v  so it would be

i think i would choose this one because of the colour it's
it's will enlight your house your home and your t v  so
yeah
yeah yeah that would be uh an idea
yeah that's that fine so we can celebrate now that's our new product
yes it's it's fine it's
i like it
next time well i'll buy one here
yeah no
okay
okay
final prototype yeah ye yeah
okay okay
s so who is going to take the remote control

'kay
it's perfect

where it's here
okay
yeah
'kay

i have slides
ah that is three
product prod
yep
okay
okay
so this is our product or prototype
this is made by clay
yeah uh the basic colour is uh yellow
and red yellow is uh our company colour uh red it's uh
is more attractive so we used two basic colour yellow and red and the shape
there's two basic shape the first is a circle and the second is a triangle s piece
it's we call it a mushroom design it's looks like some mushroom so we call it mushroom design
so this is a introduction of our product next a mo
okay yeah so next slide so there are several key features of our pr prototype
the first is that it is fuzzy i'm sure this would be the unique design the market
yeah so it's a fuzzy design and a unique design um and uh
the second key feature is that uh s circle channel um selection in the traditional
key uh traditional controller use button to to select the channel but now we have a s circle
so we can turn this ball to t to select channel so it's quite convenient
for user to use it
yeah s okay uh the third feature is a stable triangle base uh this sta uh this triangle base is very stable so
uh so it's it's um it's unlikely you cannot found it so it's v um you can put it in the table so you can turn the the ball to cha to select the channel
and there's some cute button you c can can you can see the the shape of the buttons n is a mushroom so
yeah everything's mushroom mush
mushroom design yeah
yeah
yeah th that's why if you put it in the table be careful somebody will eat it
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
uh no this our only two slides
yeah
so we cut it to see
okay so where's the battery battery
base here

okay
okay


yeah
okay
yeah i think so
yeah the shape is unique and the colour
so it depend on how d do you define fancy




uh
so my mush
mm
yeah
hmm

uh for turn turn the ball if you want to turn the ball it's very it's very convenient for you to to to turn the ball to change the channel
uh
ah it's embedded your microphone th this th th there's two two functions this is microphone array

okay
'kay
yeah yeah yeah
yeah this is microphone array in fact there four microphone so they they they they there's a microphone array
yeah yeah so you can capture voice yeah you c
yeah so you can capture s voice from different directions yeah
yeah i agree
yeah it's very easy
you can use this in this way
yeah
th this is the base so you can turn to change the channel
you just tu turn d d

yeah
yeah

yeah
no no no i if y uh if it depend on the the angle you turn the
i if if this is a channel one so it c it could be channel two channel three channel four channel five so change yeah
y uh fifth channel divided by the num by the by three hundred thirteen degree so you got how many degree you you it
no no you don't have to y no it's uh when you when you stop t uh when you stop the
the turn
then the angle you stop is the angle you is the channel you
it's it's very easy because you kn you know how many channel are there in the
yeah yeah yeah you can do it
i think so i think so you can do it i think so you can just change
there's uh also a number you know

mm hmm yeah yeah
yeah
yeah
and also you can if you i
you ca you can turn this or you ca you can you can also turn this for this you can tune it's for tune
you you if you want to skip from channel one to channel two you you skip this if you want to from uh skip from
channel one to channel ten you tune this it's like fine from coarse to fine this is coarse this is fine
so it's coarse to fine design
yeah
yeah is is this is from one channel to maybe to ten channel this is from one channel to
yeah yeah
yeah
okay
mm hmm
yeah agree agree


uh w w what do y what uh you compare with traditional uh um tr
traditional controller i think it's easier than traditional controller if you use traditional controller you have to put a button but now
you don't have to put button you have you just turn the turn the ball there's two kind of balls the smaller the the the
so you can c you can c you can control the scale but in the traditional controller how do how can you control the scale
yeah yeah yeah y you you can do it but you can also do it in the b if you you do not wa if you do not want to browsing all the channel you can just p there's also a button here
yeah this function is just for your browsing from one channel to th the next one the next s sn s the th the third one
yeah yeah
y one to ten ten to twelve uh ten to t uh twenty ten to twenty and this one t one two three four five six like this
uh there's different scale so you can you can choose how much do you want to sc
mm hmm
i i this is just a base you can just
yeah


you use your y

so th this is a d next generation controller yeah
okay okay okay
four okay
okay
three
trois
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
okay
mm
okay
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah

the solar cell is too expensive
mm yeah we have four
five
no
no no
no no no it
okay
no

we have change the electronics to from from the the the sample sensor to regular chip oh
we have to delete the the sample sensor i think
yeah it's the one it's m maybe we ha we have two versions the first version the basic version advanced version we have speak
plastic is free
wait
we we can we can we c yellow
how about we change the sale
ah we have one


okay okay agree

cou could we have look
could we have look at the p the the prod the p the cost
okay so let's say
wha what yeah
which part is the most expensive part
yeah i think it's not t t
cheaper
okay


yes of course this is my job
yeah it's uh
it's good to
to create a control instead of a computer
yeah
okay


yeah but y you know the traditional t v  it's um
yeah yeah it's flat yeah the shape is very boring could we come up with new t v  with such as this kind of t v  so you can you have base triangle base so you the t v  you can
yeah
yeah because the t v  you also
yeah
yeah

mm

okay
yeah
yeah
yeah

yep

and you can celebrate your leadership
yeah
yeah it's your job sell it yeah
okay and the twelve fifty twelve uh twelve
twenty five euros yeah twenty five euros no it's not so expensive

okay

okay
mm
so we have to give a
so we have give him give it a cute name
mush mushroom controller
pa
pine apple
okay
okay
okay
okay
twenty five euro
okay
yeah you told me you h you d you d you lost your control your t v  so so you need to buy one
okay
traditional one yeah
so this one and this one what do you choose what do you choose
okay
okay

yeah yeah

so buy one
yeah
prototype yeah
okay
okay
okay thanks

no not really just
crap
okay
'kay so whe where is the remote control

yep

what slides

yeah
yeah because mushroom was not in the trends i mean there was fruits yeah yeah
i don't think it is
mm hmm
yeah
but anyway this is not a mushroom anyway so it's fine
no i mean yeah yeah inspira inspiration is
true
but we say uh we sa we said solar

yeah
i mean we gonna try to measure how
good it is instead of just talking about uh we had three keys key points to uh for this remote control design and first one was uh
fancy
look and feel
so w we'll try to judge this feature uh with a one to seven scale one being uh no i think uh just let me check
one one being true and seven being false okay ouch
so
do we have a fancy look and feel according to you
but is it
uh i'll agree it's unique but is it really
yeah i mean fancy was was defined by s fruit and vegetable look
yeah
i dunno where the lemon is but i mean it's not obvious
if
i dunno maybe improving the texture of like having it less smooth or
yeah i dunno
yeah it's getting

okay
yeah that's
wait th that's the second point first one is we have to judge the fancy look and feel
i mean
no the colour is okay that's fine i mean it's but i would say there is more too much red
um if
right so from one to seven
no seven is false and one is true
three
okay
three
then uh let me
the other criterion is is it technologically uh technologically in innovative
yeah bu but when you say technologically it's more uh i dunno in the core or single
mm hmm
no that's good yeah
yeah th that's another really good point maybe okay
so using the same scale two
okay now maybe the most critical one
l last one w i would like to judge is
is it easy to use
yeah but this this turning can you can you just re explain me the
please
yeah
yeah but how how intuitive is it to turn things to change channels
like if you want to go from
yeah but imagine you y
yeah i'm i'm no i'm not definitely convinced it's it's the best way to if you wanna jump from i dunno one to twenty
how can you go directly to twenty for example
yeah
yeah i agree i agree but i mean if you're fro from two
yeah ju just imagine you have fifty fifty channels uh
we're not talking
yeah
yeah how d how do you know this angle is th is the correct one
so you you count one degree two degrees no
i don't think so
yeah voc vocal command is okay but w we've said previously that maybe it's not going to be th l the main
and this would be more for browsing ah
yeah
mm hmm

yeah i mean you're famous you
mm
okay the uh th this looks better yeah
yeah but it has to be on to recognise fas
ah that's not the ecological part yeah
solar
so which number
so reasonably is four is one
so three
uh we wouldn't say i mean those are sort of agreed but this one would be more five to me i'd like i mean this is the just a prototype i'm not really convinced it's so easy to use but i don't know
yeah
so you have yeah
uh by pushing zero after after the first one
yeah
mm hmm
yeah if you're changing your mind
fine to coarse
okay but this this has to stay on the table right this has to stay on the table
yeah but then uh when you turn turn it
just
it's
yeah
you know tha that's the weak point because with a traditional one you just have one hand
sure yeah you would never you would never lose this one yeah
yeah
four uh it's even easier to maybe
ok
mm
so average
three
okay so
yeah especially on the easy to use
target
okay
mm hmm
no
so we are all already nineteen
yeah
that's gonna be double curved yeah
rather four buttons oh no interface
yeah yeah that's special colours sure
yeah tha that's wheel
yeah
i think the price is okay
um no
yeah w one of the m key point is solar cells
yeah
no y i it did change but just imagine we have
yeah
yeah but this one one of the feature we were not really
yeah
yeah if
yeah
yeah that's one of the requirement
we could turn we could turn everything in either yellow or black black then is a regular colour so
yeah one
yeah
so push button then it's it's the next expensive one
yeah thi this might be
close to
okay so what's the bottleneck
double curved
yeah but flat
case what's the ca
and then one euro left
um

um

so we have one button
one wheel

it's good they're not charging anything for that
yeah y actually it's wrong we're not under twelve euros and a half
okay okay
solar cells
yeah
that's nice argument but if it's it's still four our of twelve
yeah
yeah but we just have one button
easy i don't know about powerful yeah
mm
uh that's what we've just done
yeah
um
okay
well i think we have just have to discuss if
i dunno
uh tha that was good but we should have more brainstorming like meetings maybe 'cause we just presenting one is presenting his stuff
next one his stuff and then we try to combine afterwards so it um

yeah but just don't trust too much the trends 'cause fruit and vegetables it won't last for ten years uh maybe two years it's dead
yeah
yeah
yeah but this is good because it's not a long long life product
t v  is more like fifteen years maybe so
if you have a lemon lemon t v  for
fifteen years
yeah yeah
tha that would that would make it yeah

yeah

hmm
yeah it's party party remote control

yeah
uh huh twenty five euros yeah i think it's
it's cheap yeah
no i
i'm not so happy about the fruit shape you know

yeah


no the colours are uh it's perfect yeah
true uh yeah another thing is the logo is missing still
uh
still that was one of the requirements we had it's yeah but it i don't think it's such a problem just putting the logo somewhere
yeah
mm
yeah
cute na
you cannot say mushroom because it's not the trend it's not the trend
yeah but just flying saucer or
i would say flying saucer
it's more appropriate somehow
mm
mm

yeah but that's going to be expensive you know we had some problems going to twelve euros and uh i dunno
yeah afterwards if
if it's a new trend
okay
we should celebrate

mm
yeah
our final prototype which yeah
okay
je croix que c'est dommage de le it will be sad to destroy this prototype it really looks like a banana
it is a banana


mm
okay hi so we are here for the detailed design meeting
so we will uh i will first present what we are going to do in this meeting
then
uh i've i will also take notes during this meeting and i will send you uh a summary then
as usual we will then look at the evaluation criteria of the
prototype presented by uh our two colleagues that make good work
and uh then we will see the financial aspects and the cost of the product
then we will uh evaluate the product
and uh end
with the conclusion of this project and see whether it fits
with it fulf if it fulfil the requirement or not
so d let's start with the cost aspect so so i
look at the aspect discussed last time that is to say uh to have a standard battery
to have a yellow banana shaped uh case with uh a rubber
material around it to be uh to feel spongy
and uh also at the different aspect like having a wheel etcetera
and the cost ended to be ten point seven euros so which is uh good because
we had a price gap of twelve point five euros
so for the financial aspect it's okay we can uh we can continue with this product uh as if and we are now going to see the project evaluation with uh our marketing expert
yeah
you have a presentation
participant four yes
okay
okay
okay
okay
okay
yeah
yeah
yeah
okay
okay
okay maybe you can presen okay maybe hold it so i think it's uh very uh very nice what do you think
yeah
so it's between one and seven seven is the highest uh i will give a six
maybe we all have to agree on a common
yeah

no problem so this is your
one is most
well we can choose what we want okay let's say that seven is the best
okay
so so do note the grade we have five six
for me five and what what's your choice how much would you give
on the fancy aspect on the fashionable aspect
how much would you you don't answer to this uh questionnaire
five point five average
okay
well does it
okay techne technological aspect
yeah we have the wheel we also have the rubber material
which make it uh
like
new also i think i would give a five
four
okay
no
so what's your uh grade four so we have four four f and five
yeah four
four yeah let's put four
doesn't it

yeah i think so yeah i would give a i would give a seven as well it's very easy to use
so six point five
okay
oh yeah its its f its fruit fruit shape i would say seven and is very very nice design
yeah seven okay

i think you can't miss it
okay
yeah we have the we don't sesh especially have the lightning but
so it's yellow it's okay i think it's very easy to i would say seven it's hard to miss it
yeah it's rubber made of rubber i think it's m it's uh more rubber than uh other remote control
yeah but it is uh it is surrounded by rubber material so maybe we can put a six
six is okay
yeah
tadada
we have to sum up everything
six is a good
yeah the be
okay so six is a
so it's a good evaluation i think it's very promising
huh
so this prototype is quite nice
yeah
okay

so having this at twenty five euros is uh quite attractive i think
i think the
yeah
so i think we can summarise so we have seen the prototype it's
very nice according to the work of our two designer the
the the financial aspect were okay we we have the cost below
uh our threshold and so we could sell at twenty five euros and make i make profit
the the evaluation give satisfying result as well so i think we can move to the last part of the meeting
so the cost is in the budget the evaluation is okay
so i th i think we can now uh open champagne and make a huge party i don't know if
it's provided by uh by the meeting staff
okay so congratulation
nice product
yeah
i think it was a good collaboration uh
aspect
sorry
i think we will have um much bigger project next time and a much bigger salary as well
all it depends on who watch this meeting we don't know
okay so good guys so see you for next uh successful project

hi

mm hmm

mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
i will give a a five

five

a four also because except for the wheel we don't have so much innovation the rubber is
uh a four i i
yeah
six
six
six six six point five
yeah seven
easy to find
i lost my banana
uh
six yeah okay
uh f yeah it's ru it's rubber
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
six or five five
six

yeah
mm hmm
but almo also the complexity between a phone and a remote control is not cannot compare

start to eat banana
yeah



yeah
okay
yeah fruits
it is a banana
it is the essence of bananas
i would be confused with this thing

s
how is everyone
mm hmm
like a banana
i give it a i give it a five
and you do you vote uh christine do you also vote
well we can very easily

i
so it will have five point five average
mm

it's four
yeah
d are we including the voice are you glu are we including the voice in the end or not huh no okay
yeah for twenty five
yeah
i give a seven i think
'kay

yeah we can we can put a seven here yeah
yeah
well we hope


yeah
yeah i think it's cool i think we can put a six here
so you'll make the material transparent so that it uh lights up completely or
yeah
yeah the only problem there might be which know i if it's very sensitive they will i don't know
yeah okay
mm
six yeah for me
yeah
twenty
thirty thir
okay
yeah the top
mm
so will become eight soon
yeah well it's a bit biased
okay
because i saw uh some phones that were banana shaped uh wireless phones not mobile
ones wireless for the house uh quite big also and they were selling something like a
hundred euros two hundred euros
just a just a phone wireless
yeah
yeah yeah it's much more complex but


okay
congratulations to the team uh very well we worked together fantastically
so what does the management say
what does the management say
ah

yeah
okay
mm
mm hmm




yeah okay so uh you can have my project in
uh yeah just a
four
evaluation
okay so you can go we can go through
so i made an evaluation and the the evaluation criteria is made according
to the users' requirements and the market trends we talked about uh during the previous
uh meetings so you can go through and okay so
uh we have uh six points we
we talked about before so we we want to have a product fancy look and feel technologically innovative
easy to use fashion easy to find in a room and robust uh
and uh uh i have a scale of uh seven points okay so
i go through all the uh all the points here and uh according to what
you think about the this project you can uh mm make a one point two point or seven point
okay and after we ha we have an an average and uh we see
the okay uh so uh fancy look and feel what do you think f between o one and seven

yeah
seven is the
mm hmm
sorry
eh no i just want to see something
mm hmm
uh i think uh and need to as well
need to uh i don't know if you we ha we have to put uh one uh f
if it's better or
uh uh
um
yeah or maybe we can say s seven is the best mm
oh sorry six
uh s you can how much what
oh yes i mm i dunno mm i think six it's a good uh
yeah wa can okay i sorry
okay so after the technological aspect
so we we said uh we have uh a new technological uh thing with a wheel
uh
no
four
we can put four everyone is okay or four poin
four
okay
very easy to use do you think it's easy to use
mm six for me also
six point five okay
is it fashion seven
yeah it's fashion because it's a fruit and we say that the yeah seven
uh easy to find in a room
yeah
we have the lightning or
the lighting

yeah
seven
is it is it robust
everybody is okay six
yeah okay s now um so
thirteen uh twenty twenty six point five uh seven thirty two thirty six that's that's okay
six
good uh if we say that seven it's uh it's the better and when uh s six sit six are good it's a good uh p product i think
we have a good price and uh
good



mm hmm



mm 'kay
good morning
sorry
yeah busy job
good morning
so
oh good morning everyone
i'd uh like to welcome you to our first meeting
i've prepared a little presentation
my name is and uh i hope you will introduce yourself uh in a few minutes as will i
um i'm the project manager of this project and uh well i will tell you on what
actually is the project this is uh the agenda for our first meeting
um this is the opening then we will get i will hope we will get acquainted to each other we'll do
a little tool training with these two things we'll take a look at the project plan
uh there will be time for discussion actually we have to discuss because we have to create a product and then we
will close this session um but first of all we i'd like to uh introduce
you to this room um as you probably have noticed there are little black uh fields
on the table um you have to put your laptop exactly in that field so the little cameras can
see your face um there are cameras
everywhere around the room especially here for your face of course and this isn't a pie it's a a set of microphones and there are microphones here also but please uh don't be afraid of them
they won't hurt you um well uh i said i'm the project manager and uh i'm hoping
uh for a good project and uh i'd like to hear uh who you are and what your
functions are uh on this project let's start with the ladies
okay so i
okay well we have some expertise from uh different pieces of the of the company that's good
um well i said uh we're working on a project and the aim for the project is to to create
a to design a new remote control which uh has to be original trendy and of course user
friendly and uh i hope we have the expertise to create such a project such a
product
um the way we hope to achieve that is uh the following methods it consists of three phases
namely the functional design conceptual design and detailed design as you can see all of these phases consists of
two parts namely individual work part and a meeting where we will discuss uh our work so
far okay but first i will uh tell you something about the tools we have here i
already talked about the cameras and microphones but they are not of uh much use to us uh
we will have to take advantage of these two things they are smart boards as you can see you can give a presentation on them
and uh this one here is a white board i will uh instruct you about
that soon um as you also noticed uh this presentation document is in our uh project folder and
every document you put in this folder uh is uh it is possible to show that here in our meeting
room
um and yeah there are available on both smart boards but i think we will uh mainly use this one for the documents
in the shared folder as you can see this is the same tool bar uh as
is located here um the most functions uh we will use will be to to add a new page
um uh to go back and forward between pages and of course uh to save
it every now and then um and this is the pen with which you can draw on the board for
instance
like this if everything's okay but i first have to put it on the pen you see i'm new to it too um and then you can
write things like test or whatever you want as you can see you have to move it a little bit slow it's
not such a fast board it's a smart board but also a slow board uh but you can write things and of
course you can also when you click here uh erase things so we have uh est
left and um you can also delete an entire page but we ask you not to do that just simply create
a new one and uh start all over because we want to save all the results
um does everyone understand this
nice application well you can erase it with the eraser but uh you shouldn't delete an entire page but just create a new blank one i will delete this one now because we don't use it yet
but you can of course erase when you make a mistake but don't uh delete entire pages and you can also
um let's see i think it's here uh change the uh colour of your pen
for instance take a blue one and uh change the line width like
to five um that's what you will need for our first exercise because i'm uh going to ask you to
draw your favourite animal
it's also to gets to know each other because um i'm asking three things uh for that uh drawing
to do it on a blank sheet with different colours and i just showed you how to pick a colour and also with different pen widths which
i also showed you um and a favourite characteristic can be just uh one word
well i'm not very good at drawing but i will uh go first
and um try to draw
or maybe you should guess what i'm drawing eh
well it uh
could be everything
maybe when i put on
this thing
it could be a turtle or a snail and
but a turtle has and those are slow
and i hope our project group will not be slow but we will uh work to a good result and do it uh as fast as we can okay time for another animal would you like to go next
mm hmm
okay could you write the words uh underneath it
or more words
little rabbits
okay thank you
and our final drawing


mm hmm



okay well thank you very much i can see we have some uh drawing talent uh in this group huh
well nice animals nice words sounds good um back to business
back to the money part um from the finance department i have learned that we are aiming for a selling price of
twenty five euros and we're hoping for a aim of fifty million euros and uh we are hoping to achieve
that uh by aiming for an international market and the production cost will be twelve euro fifty
max
okay well it's time uh for some discussion i've wrote down some examples here of what we can can speak about uh
what's your experience with remote controls um what kind of ideas do you have to design a new remote control
maybe for which market segments should we aim or should we aim for all segments uh well actually i'd like to hand
the word uh back to you
what's your experience with remote control
mm hmm
boring it's not fun to use a remote
mm hmm
well maybe we should try to make it fun
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm so maybe a a minimalist design the least uh possible amount uh of buttons
mm hmm
so you don't want to bother people with uh loads of buttons but on the other hand they need many buttons so they don't have to get out of their seat
mm hmm
mm hmm
okay well any more ideas
no
okay yeah well we have some time let's see what more i have to tell you i don't think there
is much left nope we're starting to close um our next meeting uh will start well we're a little
bit early but our next meeting will start in in thirty minutes in the meantime uh there's time for some uh individual actions
um as you can see the different roles have uh different tasks
and there's a ping is it my laptop
yep
ah well that's good five minutes and uh the meeting's over uh right on schedule um
the marketing expert will uh will take a look at the user requirement specification the user interface designer will work out
the technical functions design and this was the interface designer or the interaction designer or what was it
i d  interface designer okay first guess was right uh will take a look at the the working design
industrial designer okay sorry
let's just use the acronyms um and of course specific instructions uh will be sent to you uh through your personal coach
uh well those instructions will be uh in the email you will receive uh shortly i hope
and of course you have your own uh expertise well uh that was what i had to say uh are there any more questions
no okay well i think then we have to head uh back to our offices and uh start working
okay one question
okay we're still going okay well i expect everything will be much clearer with the instructions we will receive uh shortly okay well uh see you all in about thirty minutes then thank you very much
good morning

well
well uh i'm uh and my uh function is user interface design
i think so uh that's me
me too



oh

so we can't erase anything
right
alright




it's a sheep


a beaver
it's weird
it has wings
well the snail doesn't have legs


oh right

well


it's a giraffe
or a dinosaur

yes giraffe

should i uh
alright
so i can draw but uh
uh
well
oh


oh wrong one
uh

well uh you can guess what it is i hope
it's a rabbit and uh well uh it's uh quick i guess
that's uh my uh favourite animal

a dolphin

right
well

with an e 

you can try out the eraser now

not really

i always lose them yes
yeah
yeah

search for the buttons which one is which and uh

well
perhaps that you have a lot of road remotes r road con remote controls yes perhaps you can integrate them or something
yes
your stereo and your t v  and uh
perhaps that's an idea
yeah that's right and which you don't use
right
yeah you should just give it to
changing channel
yes
but you should make sure that you have every button they need on it because uh things for uh teletext i dunno uh w what's the name
yeah but
but if if it's if it's international you should uh look in think in britain they have uh
different things they can do with the t v  or so uh that you can choose what you want to see i dunno if you should
uh take that in consideration or that you just should aim for the normal t v s that uh
and the b b c 
yes
yeah i don't know if the they have that anywhere else though
yeah we can leave that
yeah
well but but then you have to to find your other remote control if you want to search that's not
yeah that's right
yeah that's uh
well not everywhere
yeah you can choose the code
yeah
but the people have a new television and c if you look into the future then they want will want the button if their thing is broke
yeah

guess not


yeah meeting will close in five minutes
hmm hmm no interface
no the yeah

so
so i should look at uh what you should be able to do with the remote or uh or how i don't really
right alright
me too


alright
yeah

yeah
okay
good morning




okay uh i'm uh i'm the industrial designer and i uh hope to uh look forward to uh a very uh pleasing uh end of this uh project


yeah

okay

hmm

seal a seal
a be
mm with a tail and a mouth
snail
okay


sure
the hell
make that cute

tall
b
bunny rabbit



okay
okay um
uh i uh draw i i've drawn a dolphin because of its intelligence one of the most intelligent uh
animals in our world
yeah intelligent i've i've uh eraser
pen
well not perfect but okay

a lot of buttons and you always lose them a lot of buttons which you don't use or who you don't use complex
not user friendly



mm
black colours
they use batteries and batteries uh and poor signal
uh
yeah different remote controls yeah
uh for the use of different uh devices

yeah but you could uh i thin uh there's a possibility to g uh to uh
to put those buttons uh behind some uh kind of uh protection so that if y y you only get to see them when you need 'em
that's possible so that you only get the no n n no just uh for example you got th uh
the same size uh remote control you use everyday but um the usual buttons such as uh
um zapping uh as you call it in dutch uh and the volume control uh are only the only
possible buttons uh to use directly or uh the numbers of course
but uh not uh the buttons used to search on the the channels on your television you only use those
uh the first time or
so uh
yeah i think so yeah

yeah uh teletext think so okay
right
uh
yeah i i understand
no
yeah
when i think of it uh i think the main idea uh of this remote remote control is uh
to make it user friendly so uh i think uh when p uh when uh the customers will buy this remote
control they already have uh the remote control which uh companies uh uh with uh
the the standards uh remote control with which comes uh with the television so uh it only has to have
uh the most used buttons you don't have to integrate the buttons to search the channels on your television
in those in that
yeah but i but it is impossible to uh to accommodate uh accommodate uh all the buttons on the
s on the difference different televisions sets on one remote control it's impossible
because uh for example sony television uh has the opportunity to s to make uh uh to make it possible for
to see on one side of the screen uh teletext and on the other side uh just n uh regular television uh
yeah but uh they don't use the same signal uh on remote control because you can't use a panasonic uh remote control on a on a philips television
okay okay
okay
okay but uh i think that most people uh th uh will buy the remote control
because because uh the first they lost the one they lost first one or the first one is broken so
uh uh perhaps they have a got a an older television so that option
is not uh optional for those uh people
yeah yeah
so we should take that in consideration
oh mm no things'll come up

stop the meeting now
okay
mm no
no the industrial designer will take a look at the working design and the in uh usability interaction yeah okay okay

okay
no
okay
oh
no problem okay
alrighty okay
my name's i'm uh marketing expert my job is in the company to promote company or promote products to the customers so i also h hope we have a pleasant uh working with uh with each other
mm hmm
s
good
no
dinos dinosaur
beaver
turtle
no problem no problem mm it was four months
nice okay
to make it a little bit easier

no it's a giraffe
'kay i think it's
easy to r uh to
recognise as a giraffe yeah the favourite charis characteristic is
that the long neck it can reach everything and i hope i can also reach a lot
with this project so that's my favourite animal
anything else you need to know
oh uh
tall
so 'kay

it's a mouse
a bunny rabbit

uh huh no problem
bob ross
dolphin


yeah
complex
no
no
boring
no black all black
so yeah
mm hmm
yeah
the the angle you have to use
you had different remote controls for different devices yes
yeah
yeah but then again you you still have a lot of buttons so
flap yeah
yeah okay that's possible but it'll get very big the the remote control
mm hmm
mm hmm numbers
on and off
yeah play pause stop

mm hmm of course


no
yeah
because i think a market will be all kind of people elderly p el elderly young people so
yeah i think that's the better one because
i think if you you're going to target a lot of people and the whole world and only britain then i think the cost will uh rise higher than the twelve fifty i think
i think the aim is better to use uh the whole world and britain yeah
not that much
mm standard deliver
mm
no but
yeah yeah th it it's i think that's not
yeah okay
no
i think n m n most televisions nowadays do this
so i think numerals
yeah but then you have to choose the this always with r universal remotes you have to choose the code you can use which
which type of television you have that's no problem but i think like the two pages on the same
screen like teletext and normal television that's that's nowadays standard i think
simplicity
yeah
yeah yeah
mm hmm
yeah g available
true
yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
of course
yeah
yeah
interface
uh huh
no
i have one question where does it says we have to make a remote because i presumed

she didn't know who
okay no no problem
no problem yeah
mm hmm

okay good morning this is our first team meeting i'll be your project manager for today
for this project my name is mark will be giving this presentation for you to kick the project off
that's my uh that's the agenda for today well of course we're new to each other so i'd like to get acquainted first so let's do
that first i mean let's start with you can you introduce yourself you're our marketing expert
okay excellent and you are user interface yeah
excellent okay
what should it look like okay
oh let's kick it off oh there we go so our new project is about we need design a remote control
for television set so which has to be original trendy and user friendly i took this off our corporate website
it's i think well it sums up what we need to do
we're inspired by latest fashion not only electronics but also the latest trends in clothes and interior design that's why our product will always
fit in your home so apparently we need to um be very at um very open to what's
currently hot in the market so that's what you need to do to bring us the latest info and what people want so
so we put the fashion in electronics so that's what we need to go for anyway we'll take this project in three steps three
pha uh three phase of design first step will be the functional design and that's basically what we're gonna do everybody
has uh a piece of individual work and a meeting afterwards so we can share information about so i'm gonna keep this short since we had a technical problem
so skip through this
uh okay every meeting we everybody can present
their uh their views and everything so to help with these you have we have the smartboards here we can use a regular powerpoint
presentation i'm supposed to give you an introduction on this doodling board so it's
actually it's very easy like it says very simple you just take out the pen
like you see here i'll just take the take here that's it you just put it on the board you see a pen here you go here just like using a pen you can just draw whatever you want
it's like the eraser can erase whatever you want
and so it will be easy just to illustrate your views if you wanna change the format you just
either take out jus just like the pen and whatever you want your current colour your line width
just to make the line bigger
so it should be really easy this is to take the just take a new slide and back again we're just gonna keep using this board all the time so i think it will be it's very clear for everyone i suppose so i'll take this out
okay we'll use that later anyway yeah just just just stuff that you wanna
share just put it in the in the project folder like i put my presentation now i'll put the the minutes of every meeting
i'll put them there too so everybody can read up if they have to leave early or whatever
so next been here well gonna give the electronic white board uh a shot so basic idea is
we have a blank sheet just try whatever you want and like it says draw your favourite animal
i think the creative genius should go first
so draw us your favourite animal
draw us a technical animal
yeah it's still erasing

so that's what we don't want we want a high responsive product so
it looks more like nuclear bomb

let's go easy on it

anyway it should it it's supposed to be a dolphin you like the freedom that it that it represents
what do you like okay well our marketing expert show us an animal
pick a pick a pick a clean sheet oh take a clean sheet first
just press next that's it



it's a cute elephant

it's a nice beard


okay so it's just a bee
so i suggest you make us the elephant in the market the big and strong player in the market this would be good okay excellent on to the next one
press next yeah it's up there
that's it



sure looks smooth

what does it want
okay
i agree
yay i'm supposed to draw the animal next
i introduce to the world the amazing
ant
great team workers
do everything to uh really small but together they're really strong so i'm gonna give it a smiley face
not sure where the p just put 'em here whatever
think it need shoes so

i'm just too lazy to draw it all black so

that's the coolest ant ever
i love to draw ants it's my hobby anyway nah just i think it's very representative what we drew i guess like you take just take your freedom and use a a trendy interface that you design for us
just yeah you're supposed to make i make it different from uh from what other people have and
just make it a little distinct anyway another beep to stop the meeting see
warning finish meeting now
uh put this down
examples well i guess we have a little little time extra but just a little
quick discussion to to open open our work so what do you guys think about the first idea is just very short i'll start
with you what are y what are your first ideas for the new product what
the project i got was just for a t v  remote control
yeah i guess so
okay so very intuitive design i guess

yeah we want
i suppose we want almost everyone to be using it so i think i mean really disabled
people yeah might be a problem but i think it's a little take it into consideration um
yeah i think we really need to cut the meeting short you have anything you wanna share quickly
it should be light okay um let's see where did i let's skip that oh this
is it sorry i skipped this sheet what do we this quick what we're going to selling price twenty five euros that's for you the
production price twelve and a half euros approximately just go go for that we'll reach the uh reach that profit
no it's not much to work on i'm sorry i skipped it anyways that's yeah this is it do you have anything you you came up with yet about uh marketing transfer whatever
marketing i'm not sure what you what you came up with yet you have anything to share or else we'll cut the meeting just cut the meeting short since we're supposed to stop
okay
anyways the the personal coach will give you the your p your personal assignments and everything so we'll just meet back in here thirty minutes i'm sure we have that
yeah thanks for attending i'll see you back here in thirty minutes
good day
nick broer user interface designer i'm going to uh look at the technical design from the uh user point of view
the creative genius thank you very much
well i'm more into the technical aspects of drawing so i'm not really good at drawing animals but uh the animal which i oh
pen
uh format
else my animal will be like king size i pretty much like a dolphin because of its uh its freedom basically let's see
a head
actually worked with this it's like uh it's a very
uh high tech bit low responsive though prefer pen and paper
it doesn't look like a nuclear bomb this thing isn't doing what i'm
what i want
so
yeah well it does look like a nuclear bomb
i'll just finish up real soon because i'm
so it doesn't really look like a dolphin but then again this is all new for me
like the ocean like swimming do that in my spare time so that's basically an
now we can forget this ever happened
it's not really that responsive no

and you was making comments on my dolphin
you picked a hard one didn't you
got it


you've done this before haven't you
well i basically had a question do uh are we going to introduce a multi remote control is it just the t v  or do we want to in
just for t v  remote control okay well i was thinking about design remote control with
our uh motto and all uh thing to keep in mind is that we need
to stick to what people are familiar with no rational changes or
whatever 'cause it revolutionary changes yes
uh we might have to consider other design aspects of our product so that was something
i wanted to add and perhaps some usability aspect t v  is becoming central in
most homes do we want people who are disabled in any way
to uh yeah to be able to use it as well
yeah
okay well that's not that much to work with
mm good luck
morning
my name is xavier juergens i'm the industrial designer and there are three main questions that i have to find an answer to today first one is uh what happens inside the apparatus second is what is uh the apparatus made of and the third is what should it look like


uh huh
mm
okay
okay you should press next
okay
okay well the animal i'd like to draw is a tiger
my drawing skills are really bad so
they are really bad my drawing skills
i'm not sure how the legs should go but
uh these are stripes
i've picked this animal because it's very fast it is uh it knows exactly what it wants uh it hardly ever wastes any resources
uh well basically uh it hunts for prey but it does it always in a very well thought way
uh it knows exactly what it wants it never kills an animal uh just for the killing so it's very efficient and it
tries to do everything as fast as possible and it always goes for uh security in seeking
uh uh a hide spot and uh and doing everything security speed and efficiency is important
and i think uh those things we can use

yeah
oh

hmm only one thing uh that has to be added according to me is uh the the material it is made of it should be something light that's it speaks for itself but some uh yeah
okay
okay
okay
good luck everyone

morning
yes um my name is dirk dirk meinfeld um i will be uh
pr project the marketing expert and i will see what the user wants and uh
what we can do uh with the new produ project product
hmm
hmm
yeah
yeah
yeah
okay



very nice dolphin



um an animal i like the elephant
what
yeah um
oh yeah oh a blank okay next free i like the elephant it's big it's strong so uh uh oh it's a little bit
you have to hold it right
hmm

it's a beautiful animal
oh you have to p press it pretty hard
with a smile on it it's very important
yeah
and uh not to forget its tail
oh
yeah it's okay
yes
i will beat the dolphin no
yeah
yeah
yeah
uh yeah
yeah
experience with the tiger
what they are
okay uh huh
oh
mm
okay

uh hard worker
yeah
yeah yeah



yeah
uh
yeah
but
yeah
uh
yeah
selling price
international
um about what marketing
um no not really yet but i've some ideas and i will uh
say it uh
okay

okay
yes
so is why not save that
do you want to replace existing file no

i actually tried to transfer it to my documents but
spreadsheet
yeah but i've ta uh right i'll just re do it that's the easiest way

right
r right um all these things have cost implications and so when i done
my thing on cost a i had assumed that the only uh
button that would be a different colour would be the uh the red apple button
so however i've now but um yeah so uh but there
would be a cost implication on that and uh as i suppose that so whether wanted to put in all
these colours would be uh open to debate i suppose
an important consideration right okay so um
and the second one underneath would be the idea for the
right okay so we've got um detail design meeting
right
so so we've got
prototype presentation which we've just done evaluation criteria um
and finance so i guess w we have to evaluate if that meets the various
uh aspects that we're looking for uh from um our previous meeting
so other than the fact that it doesn't have the second layer but um obviously
obviously it would but other than that we got the red apple we got the buttons and the only thing that has really changed
is the is the colouration of the buttons and
the bit after the evaluation criteria is uh is the finance and the
and the cost implication the only snag about this is that uh
the cost is probably kind of important so um and then the production evaluation as to how easy that would be to uh to manufacture um
and whether it would uh
right so uh as far as the the finance of it would be concern would be to make sure that the cost
aye the production cost 'cause you may remember that was one of the first uh considerations was to be in d under um
uh twelve fifty or two and a half uh twelve and a half euros
so there's no redesign so that should uh right so seems to me that the thing that i have to do is
is quickly find that uh
right
okay
right

okay so by the fact that we've got uh the simple chip and the uh kinetic energy source we've got a single curved
case we've got a rubber uh case materials supplements so we had decided that we're having rubber buttons and
okay w the button supplements well originally i thought there would just
be uh one in there because it was the one red apple
but so the so the real w the real question then would come in
do you make all the buttons
o
well so we've got one special button form which was the apple everything else is gonna be a standard
we've got special material rubber wood titanium et cetera and that so i was originally i was
thinking rubber wasn't special but according to this maybe it is so
and the r i mean effectively we've got sixteen buttons that we're gonna have on there
w i don't know is is is the sort of answer is that meant to be all sixteen buttons and
therefore i mean what's the op the option was maybe not to have rubber
buttons but just to have the one that was soft and spongy and therefore
whereas it would be the special colour would be for the so you would only have the one special button that was rubber whereas the rest would be hard plastic

mm i would
every design change is uh sound  i dunno
um okay um
if we just had all the buttons as standard except for the one red apple then that would take care of that i guess we'd have one special colour and one special button form
and when
i plugged that in last time remember it has to be under twelve and a half
as far as i know that um that took care of the uh of the various supplements and if what happened

now right okay so but the point would be that if we uh
if we just did special sorry you were saying that it would be that one that you would put in one there
okay
so it well is it s is no it's nine point seven i've got okay
so that would
that would work out fine if uh
uh as assuming your correction are are assuming that that one change covers all the buttons then that would be fine and there's nothing else as far as i can see that we we had uh planned to put on
uh huh
well hold on um if we
okay that gives us twelve point seven
but remember that the idea was to keep it the colour of the oh i see so just take out the special colour for the apple and
and go for battery instead that would give you one less
but you reckon that i i mean the thing is that you wanted to a appeal to people and not have to replace batteries
mm hmm
but which do you think or which do we think is the more important of the options in a sense
at the moment we've got a total which we need to reduce down by one point two at least remember that
was a minimum requirement the other option if we're planning on just going for something cheap and cheerful would
be to um make it originally we're gonna make it a simple product
mm hmm makes sense
sorry do you want that back up
right
okay but remember the main the only reason we were planning on having the voice recognition was so that they could find the remote if it got lost
go for one yep
okay
yeah why not not m m maybe nearer three
two three well it's just that uh saying something remember that when you look down we've got solar power we've got uh various other things you could have and we're not going for these options
mm hmm

okay
no 'cause you can't afford that w we took that out too
didn't you or
well wait a minute in thirteen point seven we do have kinetic the problem is we have to reduce down from there to
get it down to twelve point five and one way of doing that would be to take out the kinetic so
it's very much dependant on what you do with your options
and if you're definitely going for the sample sensor and sample speaker then because that
the other functions we've got in are are more at the the special material
the rubber wood titanium et cetera
if you go for that th that's at the high end 'cause that's point six whereas down at uh just special colours uh is
point two now you're trying to lose one point two so it seems to me that if you're going for the sample
sensors speaker you're basically then having to go for the cheaper options on everything else
and and the simple way to do it would be to have a battery to have your uh sample sensor
speaker and then you're looking to uh take out uh point two
which would be come from the button supplements category
um interface type um well plastic rather than rubber
that that that would make the significant difference you could either you could have it if you have a in plastic
rather than rubber then that would uh enable you to get you could keep kinetic then
you could keep your sample sensor and you'd be looking to take out point two so you could
uh fiddle that down your special form at the bottom or your special colour at the bottom and that would enable you
to to do it
yeah
ye
well okay but
it's rubber as it is yes
we got we've we've got thirteen point seven and we've got it in at the moment and if and basically we're going to reduce down from that but the current one you'd say would be fancy would be too

mm hmm
i would've said about a two as well
oh
the next on well i can just sing about easy to use i would've said yes i would go for a one on that at this point in time
um incorporates elements of fashion to attract buyer well yeah it certainly has some
yep
i don't know
yep
yeah i woulda said two would seem reasonable
the product is a recognisable real
r uh reaction product

oh

s
okay so we're going for a
two three
sure
right okay
two right come on that's that decided right so
so we're now on to changing it to get it to fit in with the budget requirements and then
about a two
two
yep
two b two b two yeah
yes
well you can lose one point two and still meet the requirements
okay well i put it back on


yes i would've thought so
okay so what was it control uh f  eight wasn't it
oh oh how kind right okay so you can see there that the
if you want to keep kinetic right you've got a choice there of going down to battery which would save you one
you've got
the sample sensor and and sample speaker which is your big item
that's right
which gets you
yes
alright
okay so
so we're going for plastic yes
yep
well uh w uh there was debate as to how you would count them you got special colour well originally i was assuming we had the red apple and therefore that was the special colour
well we've got special form now that would be one button and the question was was that all buttons or is that just one
button 'cause our plan really was to have one button only with a special so
so no matter how you look at that that would be the same the other thing would then be special material rubber wood titanium
alright so special colour you want three in there
okay
that makes sense
okay
okay yeah i would agree with that i think so special colours two
and we've got special form is the one apple the rest are all standard although
you could argue that should maybe be you were making these buttons down the bottom i was presuming bigger than the
other ones or were you was that the idea
uh huh i would have thought that's probably about r well
right
yep that makes sense
yep
i woulda said so yeah so you'd maybe put fash fan uh fashion at three rather than two
real reaction produ i'm not quite sure what does that mean
yep i would s
you mean of
well you could argue you might do it once a year you would change because at the moment you're making a red apple
so next year you could make next year's model the same but have it as a
a yeah whate whatever a lemon yeah l a lemon lemon or something and that
amount
yeah we've the main thing we've changed really is the casing isn't it we've
well ease has certainly stayed
yeah
and the speech feature
how it would play out yeah oh
well but you've got the company logo on there which would effectively be a stick on badge so you're in a sense you're comparing the product without the company logo and then y but you've got the space for it to stick it on
don't think so but but i but in the sense that as you saw with um the windows logo badge
it doesn't really matter there's virtually n the way that you frame you know the windows
badge on there it really doesn't matter what colour it is so long as our company's
logo is framed w in the same way as that with a like a black outline fact they've got black and
white or black and silver so basically even if you had a silver
the same colour of silver on your display because you've got effectively a double edging on the uh on the logo
it means that it splits off what your logo is from the from the product and that's actually
quite a sneaky way of doing it
you could put in another well in this one you've actually got three colours of buttons well we decided
that the blue ones were the um the standard colour so you were talking about
uh um we're assuming that all the buttons on the second
panel the hidden away panel would all be standard
which
m may or may not be the case
well yeah bu but but uh was the was there not a button that you were thinking of on the um on the other opt you know on the second page as it were that uh you were thinking of maybe having as a different colour
yeah well
alright okay
so we just add that to profitability in effect
right so we're meant to finish up in five minutes




mm hmm so we're okay this way around
until the design team comes in and says get off but you are the design team
so what bit are we on to
yeah i th i th oh right okay

oh drats i've botched that haven't i
right okay um
what's happened here
right okay um
mm
right okay um right so we got
so we've done the
the finance bit and the excel project and the we've done the redesign so we're now on to project process
now satisfaction with for example room for creativity leadership teamwork means et cetera whiteboard digital
pens et cetera so we're actually now uh in a sense on to the evaluation of the course
rather than the evaluation of the project is m my understanding of it
so what did you and remembering that nobody's just over the curtain so um
so
i suppose the easiest way of doing it is to put some notes down which i will do
so uh i think i have to finish that page right okay so
project evaluation so um
creativity
did you feel you got a chance to express yourselves well enough well um
individual meetings how do you mean
in you on your own
um
mm the only thing you find is in a manufacturing process you would normally you go to a meeting you decide
right you do this you do that you do that then you go away you find out information you then come back you then
discuss it you then go and change things around and then go back so
whereas this time you're really getting it from a database source so it's not uh well uh anyway so what do you want
to put down i've put seemed okay creativity seemed okay um um
flow of information
on on any given subject given
subject um sometimes disjointed
um
have could have used a different
example pel to increase create
creativity
you have to do it within a set time frame is the other thing so
i th i uh d
but the other thing is that uh they're i'm guessing that they're trying to use this um
software to to demonstrate how you could
uh do a project i mean m my wife at the moment for instance is uh acting as a computer
um for um you normally you got a problem so you go to your tutor and find out
information to see how to get it fixed so what she's doing is she's having to spend
a day at the computer terminal at one end so that any student that comes along
can uh ask whatever question and then you or the idea is that the whichever
uh person's at the other end can point them in the right direction show them where to either
give them directly give them help or secondly point them in the right direction either at the library or
uh or or come back or go and see joe bloggs or whatever
so uh and that was a project i suspect similar to this because they
they were actually trying to debug the uh computer software to enable um
to enable it to work and of course you had the machine crashing and various things
going wrong so
alright so we've got uh
new ideas found did we find any no
alright leadership teamwork
does
you've got voice recognition computers that's not remote controls
mm hmm okay
so how do you reckon teamwork went
to uh go uh reasonably well okay
bit bit arbitrary
mm hmm
so we're m we're meant to comment on leadership and the means e  g  whiteboard digital pens et cetera and and new i new ideas found was the the other thing
now i'd much rather be in marketing but
i certainly didn't get this uh computer to work as well as i would have liked however um
alright uh means so whiteboard um so really it's uh equipment oh
right new ideas found so one or two
um
and uh
voice
uh was it voice activated um
recognition
right so uh are the costs within
budget yes is the project evaluated yes uh don't forget to complete final questionnaire and meeting
summary then celebration
yeah
uh so we don't re so really
i tried to save this the last time at twelve point three and it didn't seem to have saved anywhere mind you the the figure last was was different but it should be poss
we also have a apple slash cherry design at the top
yeah yeah we might get a
for the m 
they're thinking
for the first time well it was hard to get the h um the actual labelling on the individual buttons
hum you separate off in colour the volume related buttons from the channel related buttons so you've got the volume in orange on design there and the the channel is in blue
yeah sis
yes we'll have the slide away
bottom
mm hmm
yes yes
okay
mm hmm
this this is a yes this is our presentation of the prototype
mm hmm
could we get this on the board just so we can see or do you mean do you have the figures there
'kay alice
so sh
'kay this should be then
mm hmm

have a push button interface
um
um
yeah
and then we'd have
so that's nine point one there so we've got some
'kay
just give us a bit of
i switching around those th um on the electronics we got the sample sensor at the moment we've just got the simple chip
which costs one um i guess the sample sens sample speaker would be the voice recognition thing
which puts up to four we should be slightly over our budget but if we gather something else down to slightly lower standard and maybe
go with the one the special form buttons then we could have the speech
so uh maybe if we got rid of like the maybe one of the special colours kept them all the same colour then we could have the voice recognition without
yeah yeah um
oh possibly yeah yeah maybe maybe um we'd be giving up on the kinetic
um
we should yeah that would save us one though we'd still be slightly ov
yeah yeah well since it's the through the whole technology type thing um you were saying
in the market research that people like kind of interesting gadgets in them um whether they would figure the
the s uh sample senor and the sample speaker voice recognition be sort of a worthwhile thing to have
and then still have the batteries or whatever they would prefer not uh you know what i mean the the problem was the battery's running out and losing
the um losing the remote so you gotta decide which of those is more important to them
yeah
okay
okay
okay well we have a single curve which was maybe like the feel of the product's quite good so uh
um then we have the rubber kinda spongy feel which was in at the time
um sorry that'd be considered fancy
so maybe maybe a two
yeah
um deciding between the kinetic power or um the speech recognition and if we had either of those for our budget they both show a reasonable amount of speech recognition
um
but not the kinetic
like the power
no we c ca yeah we can't afford both
no may is maybe about neutral plus it it it's got something but it hasn't got
right
okay
'kay
okay
um
mm hmm
so it says if we make a slightly more fancy then we lose points innovation and if we make it more innovative innovative then we lose points on it being fancy so
yeah yeah
um
it does yeah
yeah m um yeah it was just doing it quite well um i think we're gonna have to lose some of these but the moment as it stands it's um
uh the sensor using all of its all of its products all of its buttons and it's got a fairly big label on the bottom saying
where it comes from
okay

also it's kind of spongy rubberiness is maybe bit more kinda comfortable than kinda sleek and new age um it depends which way you look at it
maybe a kind of three uh d


yeah so it's
so should we get so are definite was it thirteen point seven was the definite price rule if has okay so we need to
so i guess this is this the last stage once we sort out the finances part of it
yeah yeah we'll make the adjustments and then see how are rates are going
oh actually we just have a plastic case then we lose two points which gets us um
in right within the budget range
so that's eleven point seven and then we could make sure we definitely had all the button supplements
possibly yeah
um
and that would allow us to have all the technical innovations so we'd lose a little bit on the maybe kind of
oh yeah and that would now be yeah that's that's within the budget um
do we actually have do we just have one special uh special forms down here
um
and we we've we've got we've got enough for another we've got nought point eight left so we've got enough for another
yeah um
but the but but but the
i think maybe the special colour we've got three now just because the volume buttons are different i guess we'd have the ones which are blue at the moment would would just be the standard colour yeah which i think we should yeah they'll still be fine for the for the price
okay uh that's probably it
ne uh
maybe that'll be a second supplement then there's a spe a second special form
um
well you got you got twelve
so i think that should still be okay yeah that's twelve point three so we're still
within budget on that um
so decide we've lost a little bit on the fashion and lost a bit on the fancy kinda side of it but generally speaking we've kept the other attributes to the
that's without
yeah
and specially it definitely could fits the the real product what was the what's the company name
r yeah yeah yeah i mean it still seems definitely fit that p so that's like if that's the new age kind of um inno innovative
c type company then um having the kinetic feature and the voice recognition is p quite high up on
um
mm hmm
yeah so it's a
whatever fruit was in fashion next year

that yeah that was uh that was just about all i think we've saved quite a bit because we've just got the push button interface which is by far the cheapest
um
so maybe in a sense not having that maybe we've lost some maybe lost something on the innovation side i dunno and that is like the most standard type of button
yeah
and everything else has stayed pretty much the same so
yeah plus if anything that is special forms makes it slightly easier to
to use
um well we've still got the kinetic energy um
yeah the speech feature
i think we've cut just about the same we've maybe lost
hasn't it it's hard to tell how the rubber the rubber casing would really affect
um
but i think more the the features of the actual control will be more important than maybe than the the actual aesthetics but
but either way i think we've made it fairly close to what
just the the company logo so maybe there's like a set design which we get printed off
okay
yeah yeah
i'm still not quite sure we've established that
yeah
um
yeah maybe we've m
maybe for the the one they're gonna see all the time we make it look good and um fit the kind of idea of what they want and then for the more functional buttons we don't worry too much about that and just have that as like a plus it's hidden away anyway you're not gonna see it at the start
yeah
'kay

uh that's good
definitely lemon shaped

you had to have rubber buttons if you had the rubber case so i think we can we're okay
then we say it's fine so it's all good
just in case we need that point two for lawsuits and such like
and we seem to have least something in each criteria
we haven't completely left anything out so
as an overall product which has to be quite cheap we've just about achieved
everything
we've got the closing

we should just go through this quickly and then
um yeah yeah
yeah i suppose and then be going out and finding more information each time and then diff things will be relevant
is this go it kinda kis fits the purpose that it was something everyone knows about and then
something we can at least look at and think how we can improve on
one of those things like uh companies can have like a range of products and
i don't know how it works but i guess that something got sent out and have like a brief to kind of
yeah
well sh we look at the last slide see if it's got anything else i think there's one one more to go
it was quite good with this um the white board having that and the digital pens like that's something that made it a little easier
voice recognition especially not could
yeah
yeah so it's just like the same products but just put together in a different way
um
yeah i guess we all had separate ideas and then discussed them
so it's not just for us it's for the experiment as a whole so
should we quickly look at the last slide sh
is that everything
well we've made our prototype anyway
we can have a good look at that
mm hmm y no it's a slightly curved around the sides
um it's almost curved like up to the main display as well and the little
line at the bottom indicates the bit the panel that you pull down and the extra function buttons are below
that panel on the little line and we've got the stick on the button with the company logo on

yeah it's a bit more fun isn't it and it's kinda not really at a kind of you think apple you think computers like apple mac
yeah and cherries are fun summery ah that's the mute
it it'd probably have to be labelled mute but um we didn't have anything small enough to write
yeah
uh we just chose simple shapes for all them um the important ones are the volume ones so we made them a bit bigger the mute could possibly be a bit smaller
mm hmm
yeah and we chose a v  plus and v  minus

well the colours wouldn't like that's they wouldn't be too important but we didn't have any white play doh so that's where the colour buttons came from


uh that's it
maybe if you just minimise that one in the top right hand corner of the little box yeah

s
um d wouldn't you have to keep the simple chip there as well you know how you turn that one to a zero wouldn't the chip and the sample speaker be separate things so you need both of them
i think the voice recognition
but i do think uh the v uh voice recognition thing would be more impressive than the fact that it's got no battery

yeah i'd maybe give it a
a two
one's true
and a four is neutral
yeah 'cause we haven't got the double curve so we can't like say it's completely true but it's pretty close we've got almost everything we can
yeah
yeah i suppose that might be in the technical innovation bit
maybe a three
i would give it more than a four
how much of a difference would it make if we made the case in plastic
because we did say that we don't wanna follow the fashion too much if the buttons are rubber that might be spongy enough and then it stand the test of time better
mm hmm
well i suppose it's rubber as it is isn't it
yeah
yeah two or three i'd be happy with a two

yeah
yeah i would say so as well
yeah it's got the cherry and the sponginess
maybe two
yeah that's a bit rough at the minute

uh well it's got the same um speech feature as the coffee machine
yeah two or three well the logo would be more um recognisable on the actual thing it's just that the pen wouldn't really write on that paper but um
i think the logo would definitely be recognisable and it does have attributes that other products do two aye go for it

what does what do all them numbers mean then do we add them up and rate or anything

we'll probably have to re rate it
ah it's on

yeah i think that'd be fine because that was just a trend and we do have rubber buttons anyway
yeah
yeah i think we should just imagine white buttons
yeah
yeah the volume ones should stand out a bit

real reactions

yeah i don't see how we could make it any more
um apart from maybe
doing the whole thing in the kinda light shade of blue like the casing

but then what colour would you make the r s
no i just we got the logo off the web browser

mm hmm

um i don't think they would really need to be i think if they were just all small round blue buttons it'd be fine needs to be an enter button but could just be the same as well
mm hmm

shouldn't we maybe lose a point on fashion go to a three 'cause we've lost the overall spongy feel
'cause it doesn't seem right that it just hasn't changed at all
alright did we decide what that was which button it was on the volume ones
right
um can i just check if that's a cherry or an apple did we decide against the apple because of apple mac and did we make it a cherry officially right

so were we aiming for a certain target on that scale
right
so do we have anything else to discuss
huh
yeah

i think it maybe could have been a slightly more creative project i mean a remote control isn't the most um
kind of fancy thing that you could imagine designing
i can't think of a better example at the minute

well it's a different application of it
yeah

well leadership's a bit of a funny one isn't it
but we can't really all fairly comment on leadership because you are the project manager you were the leader so our experience of leadership wasn't really
as much as yours


yeah very nice
but i mean i d i don't i'm not sure i see the value in these i mean they record what you're writing and then what do you do with it where do you get the recording do you plug the computer or something
right i think you watch a video of it kind of
voice um recognition thing
pretty much

no you'll ha have to open it up from elsewhere
yeah you have to you have to close that window 'cause that's the save one isn't it so
and then find it


you pass it round to have a look
mm very nice
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
so it is yeah cherry would be alright actually yeah
mm hmm copyright yeah what's this this one what's that one there
oh okay right

uh huh
okay
mm hmm

mm hmm
yeah
i'll see if i can find them
have

mm hmm
mm hmm
right

so if you had to do a presentation or will you just work it on the prototype
that's the pr
okay
we should plug it in do you wanna plu do you wanna plug it in into the the back of that one
we could do it as we d go along the production costs looking at the prototype
well do we'll do it on the prototype so do two see how much it is
yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah i think you just do one don't you for the
i think i think it's just it's just a one else
i thi i think i think the button supplement i is just a supplement for all the buttons made in a different material rather than per button
i don't know though
hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
you've just gone off the window into another one it's on the bottom row
yeah yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm

yeah
yeah
yeah we have to have it
yeah
yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah
shall we shall we evaluate the prototype as we've got it now first and then sort
of make decisions about what needs to be changed after okay right
um i have a little thing so we've all got a note of it's thirteen
point seven isn't it with everything we want on
yeah i just had a presentation to
do
mm hmm mm right okay um
this is about the evaluation criteria that we use for the the prototype we've got here and so the method is that
the design team makes a prototype and we evaluate the prototype against some criteria that we've formulated
and those ones are gonna be in response to sort of market research and also finance i guess
and do that on a scale from say true being one and false being seven so if it's neither true nor false then that's four
so i got a set of criteria just based on the marketing that we need to add in a financial one as well at the end um so
we have to say whether it's true or false that the product looks and feels fancy
um
the whether the product demonstrates technical innovation whether it's easy to use
whether it's incorporating sort of the fashion element to attract the buyer and whether it's a sort of recognisable real
reaction product and i have to go up onto the whiteboard and do this apparently so
i'll go over here
right so the first one is um does the product look and feel fancy so if we do a sort of a one
so
yeah
okay
yeah
yeah yeah

of but i think what is one false or is t one true i forgot one's true and okay seven's fal four is neutral okay so
right
okay right i gonna put underneath so i've got some more space
so false is seven true is one and
so uh say about a two for fancy you think okay
okay well d you do an average at the end i don't know um
uh huh
this this is just this is just for like the look does it sort of look fancy rather than functional so
yeah so that so sh should we go for a a two on that
'kay and i mean how much does the product demonstrate technical innovation do you reckon
d yeah
okay so what about the pr the prototype as it is we've got we've got the speech recognition on it haven't we
but not the kinetic
alright so
so it doesn't it's pretty the prototype as it is isn't sort of um fulfilling the

okay yeah
right okay
mm hmm
s
i'm just gonna check my email
i'm just gonna check exactly what it said in the email for um
the product
okay but i
okay
yeah
i just read the email again and it sort of says it's evaluate the design sort of as it is i think so
i think we need to think about finance after we've sort of evaluated that design i don't know
whether we're doing it in the wrong order or something or
so i mean does this need to go up a bit or something 'cause we've got both the
both the um
the speech
yeah
yeah um for for innovation so we've got the speech the speech thing and
do you reckon a two
okay two and the next one is i'll have to get it back up now
okay
um
say about a three maybe
it's a two
yeah this is
this
yeah
so this is about sort of the corporate image of like new sort of sleek technology and all that sort of thing as well as having the logo on and all that so sort of
is it sort of a recognisable product does it fit in with our other other products which uh are sort of coffee makers and spacecraft

what do y
yeah
uh huh
so
two or three
yeah
two or three
how
two okay
right
yeah
yeah we s yeah i think we sort of add them up so sort of at an average is gonna be i'm just gonna do this in my head one point eight isn't it or something i think anyway
so yeah pretty close to a two
so
so it's i mean it's pretty good at the moment but it's gonna get worse isn't it but we've gotta try and make sure it doesn't get too bad

yeah
do you wanna plug it into yours so we can get up the
the finances
i'm not sure
yeah
it's come on already
mm
yeah
different different colours yeah yeah i was i was thinking that because maybe maybe the sort of rubber case is a bit less in sort of the corporate identity than the sort of you know sleeker plastic case
lose a little bit on the fashion yeah but
and then
yeah
yeah
well i thin i think you you you just need two for the special colour 'cause it's just two supplements you know one original colour and then sort of two supplements i think maybe
okay so we only ne we only need two for that 'cause i mean these these are moulded the one colour's gonna be moulded out of a piece of plas uh of rubber isn't it
right
yeah that
yeah

okay so tha
so shall we do a well um
yeah
yeah so
uh
so it's w if we've if we've put in for another special form on a button then maybe they could be
a different shape like we got a cherry one maybe other ones could be something else
shaped i don't know that would be poss seeing as seeing as it's cheaper to make them a different
seeing as we've got you know we've made it a a special form so and that would sort of maybe keep us close on the sort of the fashion type one and it would sort of you know keep it quite fancy as well i don't know
well you could
yeah

yeah i mean the volume buttons could be lemons or something maybe
okay
so we've what have we what have we rid of we got rid of
the plastic
is it the rubber
yeah
yeah
but uh
so i mean we've got we got rid of the rubber case but
we've now s we now sort of got an extra form and an extra colour for the buttons so maybe in terms of sort of fanciness and fashionability we're pretty much the same maybe so i mean we could maybe put two again on them
yeah
yeah and what about the sort of innovation
do you think
okay
and then the corporate identity
yeah whether whether that's considered to be sort of
part of the corporate identity i don't know
i mean it's maybe not i mean
yeah
yeah
yeah okay well i mean
we cou
mm hmm
yeah
yeah
hey what what what's the company colour did you get told what the company colour is or
oh right
hmm

mm hmm
mm
okay
uh huh 'cause you've got sort of we've got point two to play with if you really wanted to
another colour or would that be t
yeah
okay
yeah
yeah shall we save the point two for profitability then
hmm
yeah i mean it's the sort of thing that i mean you wanna pick up the controller and just hit a button quickly to change the channel
or volume so if it's dead obvious then that's fine but if you're opening the panel and you're looking and you're tuning then you're paying
a bit more attention so it may be sort of different colour buttons isn't so important
'cause you yeah
so
yeah i mean so we've dropped the cost but
same sort of function the criteria it's alright just made a load of money
well but i think we said that w
because you got rid of the rubber we put an extra an extra sort of fruit um shape on one of the buttons le lemon sh
i think well we could have lemon shaped ones with the volume ones or something or something like that yeah

did did you have to have a rubber case though for rubber buttons or was it the other way around
right okay
yeah
so that so we've saved

saved two euros on that
mm hmm

well we're aiming for um one for all of them
m but it really has to fit into the budget so
i guess we just have to adjust things to
get it i in the
which is fair enough
yeah
yeah i think
most
yeah
yep
i don't know what's on the agenda
uh huh

finish your meeting now
yeah
okay
oh

i thought some of the divisions though between sort of the individual meetings were a bit arbitrary
yeah well we were finding out various things in
in be in between the meetings and they didn't the one meeting didn't always follow on for the other one you know
sort of we had things thrown in at the second meeting where you know you'd looked at the
remote controls and seen the curviness but in the first one you'd also looked at some remote controls and looked at the buttons
and i don't understand why it would be in separate meetings that you'd do that you know you'd sort of you'd probably present it at one
or something like that
yeah
uh huh
yeah
yeah
yeah

yeah
yeah the thing itself
yeah
yeah
mm hmm
yeah but think like it was a bit restrictive just to say that you have to design a television remote control
in a way i mean it depends what sort of business you're in i guess i mean this one seems from the website it looks it's quite
innovative but we're coming up with some bucket shop product aren't we that's you know fifteen
quid
yeah
mm hmm
hmm
mm hmm
yeah
i mean if you look at their products on their website here real reaction i mean it's all pretty high tech and cutting edge and
yeah yeah
we did find a new idea i mean sort of a kinetic remote control i've never seen one of them before batteries i think so
mm yeah
yeah
mm
that went okay yeah
mm hmm yeah

i don't think sort of the budget um allowed us to do anything
well i mean i don't think it i just don't think it fitted in with the rest of their products i mean they've got all these sort of you know
high definition d v d  and
portable seven inch d um lightweight computer screens and uh i'm thinking do you know one cheap remote control doesn't really fit in surely they they should produ
yeah

yeah
yeah


yeah it worked comput computers could be a bit difficult at times but
i think there's a little there's a little um chi
there's a little there's a little chip i think you must plug it into something and it produces a
i don't know whether it just produces a big image of sort of everything you've written or something and page after page
yeah
kinetic powered remote control um
what was the other one
vo yeah

voice recognition yeah s
almost to fill in these fill in these questionnaires
oh no

hmm i think that we've got two questionnaires and a report on the last meeting
hello
good morning
uh before i start with the with the meeting i have a few things to tell you about the the setting we're in uh
because we're uh being watched by uh big brother so um yeah yeah
this uh these are cameras so are these this thing uh that looks like a pie
are actually all microphones
so you must be careful with uh with uh all this and uh as i can see you uh you have placed your laptops uh exactly on the place where it must be and that has to do with the camera settings so we don't have our uh laptops in front of the cameras
and indeed so they can see our faces okay
welcome at the kick off meeting my name is uh danny wolfs
uh this is the agenda for today uh first a little opening uh i will introduce myself uh and uh i think it's very uh good to introduce uh yourself
uh then uh a little bit of acquaintance acquaintance to uh to to ourselves so uh we get to know each other uh that will be done uh with a tool training from the he these two uh smart boards
then the project plan what we're going to do and how we're going to do it uh and discussion about that and a little closing at the end
okay uh my name is uh danny wolfs i'm the project manager what's your name
user interface okay
industrial yes
okay thank you
first a little about the project aim uh the the the aim is to make a new remote control uh maybe you have read uh read the website it's a very uh yeah very uh ambitious uh company
they uh they wanna do something else i w uh there must be a new remote control uh
first of all uh it must be original uh and trendy that's two things really uh
close to each other but at the same time uh user friendly and they have uh yeah that's uh very important
uh for them
uh there are three stages there is a functional design so uh what are we going uh
to uh to do what are we going to uh uh make f uh kind of functions in the remote
and why are we going to do it then the conceptual design how are going to do it
and that's uh really global uh because at the detailed design how
part two uh we go uh to dig in uh really about how the the te the technical of if
it's uh it's possible technical wise
uh each stage is uh uh is broken up in two uh two stages individual work and a meeting so it's uh it's very straightforward
okay the tool training we have two smart boards this one is for the presentations
the powerpoint presentations or the word presentation of whatever you uh you had uh and this
is uh only for uh drawing so uh we uh must let it uh stand on this
uh this programme this is called a smart board
thing uh yeah it speaks for itself um and as you uh
may have heard the documents in the shared folder uh can be uh showed on this screen not in y the the my documents
so if you wanna show something put it in the shared folder
uh
this uh is very straightforward with the save the print the undo the blank the select the pen well i don't uh gonna explain it all because i think you know uh how it works
um we must not forget uh everything we draw on here uh all must
be saved we we may not delete anything so uh if you have uh drawn something save
it never delete it that's a very important uh thing
okay uh little uh little kinda exercise to uh know each other
at uh the white board on the left every uh every one of us uh must
draw our favourite animal and uh tell uh tell us why we uh
had uh chosen that animal
uh important is that we use different colours and uh different pen widths widths widths yes
yeah
no no no it's uh it's uh i i i must do it yeah yeah yeah 'cause we uh
really don't know each other and uh it's kinda new so getting used to each other we can uh have a little fun then
before we uh dig in really to the hard stuff that kind of thing would you start with drawing your uh favourite animal
okay okay yeah okay drawing goes with uh this thing do not touch your hand on uh this little uh thingy here that's uh important so hold it uh like this
yeah kinda so um
you must p p uh push a little uh good because and uh wait uh wait a few seconds it's not uh fully real time so uh watch it
oh yeah
well i'm gonna paint in the red
oh that's the background colour
well undo
um
the pen
no
one minute please
yeah that's the one
well five okay

my favourite animal huh
yeah you can guess what it is
may uh paint uh next
no it's not an orc
you don't see it uh at the ears
you have an orc at home
thank you
so it's a cat
simba 'cause uh we have a cat at home and he's called simba 'cause he looks like the uh the the lion from the lion king
so we uh found it kinda cool to uh name it after a lion
he's happy with us so uh
he's smiling
no only the face because we have we have twen twenty five minutes so we uh yeah
yeah
okay who wants to go next
yeah
so choose a colour choose a pen width and draw a
yeah
save it okay
kind of firm touch
yeah
because uh my cat is red uh at home and i have red hair so uh must be red

it is a turtle why a turtle why tim
you watched it a lot you watched it a lot
it's a scared turtle

okay tim thank you
jurgen you want to go next
format
and then you have the the current colour you can change
so no red or green
and uh line uh width
i had five tim had uh tim what kinda line width did you have

okay it's a dog
okay why a dog you have a dog at home
had a dog yeah
ah
you have an artistic uh inner middle


so i think you can see it's real uh really a easy programme to use not difficult at all
okay thank you
janus the last one
yeah after a cat a turtle and a dog
i think he's gonna draw an elephant

uh oh




no
better to draw with a with

but what is he uh is it a rabbit
do you have a rabbit at home
is it a white rabbit f it's the white rabbit from the matrix
okay then yeah
okay finishing touch and then we're going further
yeah
yeah a little
well i think the dog is the the most uh artistic
don't choose for youself that's selfish okay now we're gonna dig into the to the serious stuff
uh the selling price for the remote will be uh twenty five euro and the production
cost uh may not be more than uh twenty and a half euro so
uh from my point of view i don't think it's uh gonna be very uh very high tech high definition
uh ultra modern uh kinda remote for twelve uh fift uh twelve and a half euro
uh the profit we must make with uh the new remote is uh fifty million
euro so that's a lot we have to sell uh a lot of uh
uh i think uh w when the selling price is twenty five uh uh you got
two million two million remotes but our marketing range is uh market range is international so we have
uh virtually the whole world we can sell uh
we can sell our r remotes to at least that uh countries which have uh a television
um
so now it's time uh for us to uh going uh to discuss a little uh things you can think about uh
experience with a remote control uh yourself at home what you think might be uh a useful
uh new feature what uh what can distinguish our new trendy remote control from all
the others
um so uh let's uh let's uh discuss a little i'm gonna join you at the table
well what what's the most uh important thing at a remote control
okay so not a not a remote control who uh uh which can uh can be used for television and a d v d  and radio and or just only
if you have them on uh i can uh
okay
oh in case you want it
this is a dead kind of fly between the the the yeah the the uh
yeah be the screens
no no no only all the drawings go there at the left uh

oh that pen drawings uh no i think uh when it is uh in word and you have saved it in the shared documents folder you can show it there yeah
yeah
yeah
okay five minutes yeah
yeah
yeah
mm hmm
okay okay
okay
so it be uh a multi purpose uh very technically uh high uh
remote yeah it must be really uh innovative technical wise
yeah
so yeah i i agree with you so we must focus on things who are really uh really add something to uh to
yeah
no
mm hmm
yeah
yeah
but we have to keep an eye that it's uh at the beginning of such a project it's it's it's very
uh cool to talk about well this would be cool that would be cool uh but we must not uh lose
uh sight of the the user uh uh friendly uh
yeah okay yeah okay
and that's because we have him
okay uh next meeting will start in thirty minutes so uh you uh will have uh
individual actions where i presume uh will be some feedback uh via the m the mail
um the the the industrial uh designer has to
uh look at the working design
uh the user interface designer has to look at the technical functions so that's the thing we uh discussed yeah
okay um wha
yeah
yeah
but maybe because uh you are working on the user requirements you are working on the technical functions we uh must uh have a little or kinda uh uh uh how do you call it uh
uh a little plan on on what we're going to do so you don't uh uh come up with the user requirements who don't fit the the the the technical functions at all
some basic things we co we want to going to do uh i think that's well uh yeah
will come in handy
okay
w he says
yeah
well th that's that's really a step further but if you say uh is it uh uh one way or multi purpose that's a
why
why
yeah
yeah
okay
okay
so uh each individually i individually uh must think on what's uh at
uh his point of view is the most important and uh then we're going to fit
uh all the pieces together the next meeting
i must finish off now so it's over you uh will receive specific specific instructions uh by your personal coach and i see you in uh thirty minutes thank you
be careful
hi
oh
good morning
i'm juergen toffs i'm the user interface designer

ach

ooph



very artistic
okay

wow
he does have body uh
huh
you don't have to change the colour and the pen width during uh the drawing or
you have to draw uh push hard on the pen or uh

oh uh hmm
okay
oh
it's a very bloody cat
it's a frog
uh it's an apple
a dog
huh
oh it is a turtle

it's uh inside its shell you'll be uh finished sooner
wow


yes okay wha thank you
yeah
um
how did it work
performance
and a pen
um
well very good i just uh thought i'd pick the easiest one
well we had a dog a few years ago and and it yeah when it died we didn't get a new one or something but uh
uh a graphical user designer so
hey
oh
no can work together ah colour
well it's okay

yeah

uh oh oh he is the artistic design
remote control animal
well with the interface it might be easier to ha to draw here and display there uh
than on the with yeah i m i mean like uh like on here drawing drawing uh and then displaying on screen but
too expensive yeah
a green rabbit
there the g white green rabbit
he's a little bit stoned there

yeah how much is it hundred million uh remotes or something
oh yeah
um well i think the most important thing of a remote control is that you can switch channels and my opinion is you should keep it as basic as possible uh

is it possible to open pen drawings in this uh on this screen
uh but um which the ones we made on the
oh only in word okay
for what purpose
we
and and the price
okay
and him
yeah um one thing uh we must first agree on uh what we're going to m going to make do we are we going to use um it it for multiple systems or uh we should have some agreement on that before we
okay
ah okay
consensus on the what we're gonna do
yeah
well yeah if the technical functions have to be designed i i've gotta know for what kind of machines they will be or do we use it a text screen or uh will it be with uh with bluetooth or
okay
mm hmm
okay
sorry
yes
yeah
no come up
hi
morning

hi my name's uh i'm the industrial designer















by the way why was your cat uh red
oh okay
oh yeah sure
no it's a turtle

must be a dog yeah






uh

hmm

yeah sure
uh thanks

i figure i should do something like that but i'm gonna do something much more difficult

exactly uh

yes no
no
yeah exactly
so

uh i figured this is a pretty b good impression of a rabbit
uh uh
uh well
where does the pen go just uh
uh i figured the rabbit was actually the most uh impressive
oh sorry
twenty million
two million oh yeah two million yeah
and and him
i figure we could get back to it on the next meeting actually
yeah
yeah actually it is
then looking at individual components so that's actually a f step further
yeah we can take it from there yeah i agree uh we can take it from there
or edit
okay cheers

good morning
by big brother
okay
mm hmm
yeah
okay
of our faces


i'm uh tim um my function is the marketing expert

speaks for itself



i have a question um this exercise um did the company board tell you to do it or uh did you just make it up yourself
it's part of the introduction okay
okay
um yeah i don't know really how it works but maybe you can show us first

you g you get electrocuted or



it's like pictionary
the the one who says it first gets a raise

it's a pork
mm yeah i have it at home

what's it called
ah
miniature size
okay

okay we have to speed up
remember you use uh different colours and different pen widths
i okay
save it
you have to save it
i've done it new
'kay
mm uh
not really um
that one
yeah
okay
open
which one is it
smart board okay and now
okay
okay thanks
'kay i've speed up
'kay that's fine
line width
it's not an apple
hmm
colour
something like this
smaller
um
'cause i liked teenage mutant hero turtles

uh
no it's uh
no no it's coming up
mm
uh
something like this okay you know very artistic
yeah
here you go


uh the big lines were like nine
uh it's p
it's pretty good uh

an artist
think you uh picked the wrong uh function
wrong job

wha
that's enough thanks
i wonder


i'm gonna design a remote uh remote control animal
oh sorry
yeah
that that might be easier but at the other hand uh a pen like that is easy to hold in your hand and
i think it's easier to draw yeah with a pen than with a mouse mouse
mouth
oh okay yeah w with this paper it's too mu too expensive

it's a rabbit with uh broken legs
yeah
it will do
project manager uh
have you been uh counting the time
okay
let's go on then

it's pretty abstract


like how much
yeah
yeah
i think so uh but i have some points can i show them on the on the big screen maybe
yeah yeah i can find uh
screen okay
okay i have some uh points from marketing point of view um just the standard thing li
things like uh intuitive uh small fairly cheap uh it's pretty cheap twenty five euros
uh brand independent um i think it doesn't have to matter uh which
brand your t v  or other thing is um
five minutes okay i'll wrap it up quickly um i personally think it has to be multi purpose
uh most of the remote c uh remote controls are uh just for one purpose and uh
by making it multi purpose it uh has a new feature adds a new feature to the market
and distinguish from uh from current products
um maybe some other technology than infrared uh i rather find it very annoying
um like when someone is standing in front of the t v  then you can't switch it um
think about um sending it over radio waves or bluetooth
that might be a little bit uh expensive um
and something like an l c d  screen
um uh like i said here um
maybe it's easy it's nice as an added feature feature that um when you're on a certain channel you can see on the l c d  screen uh what programmes are coming up or
from my point of view yeah
yeah it has to be uh
yeah our company is very uh
good in making new innovative uh things
so i i i i
to the current market
look you got some cheap uh remote controls there
they just uh
yeah you got a dozen of 'em
but when you enter a new market with a remote control and
uh wanna gain market share
you have to do something special i think
yeah
yeah of course but it's but but this is just from marketing uh aspect
i don't know anything about user interface or design

mm uh i i don't think we have to be we have to agree on that uh
i think th that's a pha yeah that's a phase further ju just uh
make some mock ups some some general ideas and and then we can plan
yeah
we can plan further i think
mm yeah
i don't know you decide you're the project manager
uh tha that's a same step further
yeah
uh
yeah
like we all have a list of uh things that has to b that have to be in it or how it has to be like and then in the next meeting we decide
w what it's gonna be a
and then you s then you can delete uh
the o the obsolete uh details
i think
yeah
yeah
damn
success
good to see you all again let's see if that comes up
this is our functional design meeting
um
just a sec while my powerpoint comes up
et voila
okay mm um we put the fashion in electronics
let's start okay our agenda today um just check the time it's twelve thirteen
um
i'm gonna do an opening talk about um did you all get the minutes i e mailed them to you i'm also putting 'em them in the shared folder
so um then i we'll talk about our general objectives and have your three presentations
um i'll talk about the new project requirements i've just received and then we have to make a decision on our remote control functions
finally we'll just close we're starting this meeting at approximately twelve thirteen and we have forty minutes so
first of all the functional design objectives uh we need to keep in mind the user requirement specification what needs
and desires are to be fulfilled the functions design what effects the apparatus should have
and the working design how the apparatus actually works to fulfil its function
okay three presentations um you can go in any order you choose um
sure please do
yes i do
yeah
function f  eight yeah
the blue one f n 
is it plugged in all the way and you screwed it in and
mm 'kay it's taking it a little bit
'kay there you go
press the little presentation it's the um it looks like a y  kind of over there above draw
there that one there you go

thank you very much that was that was great um 's move on to the next presentation um on effects was that you great
push
user interface right
interface
mm 'kay thank you
okay
hmm
hmm

mm 'kay thank you very much that was very useful it's funny to see the drastic difference between those two remotes um
and neither of them were very pretty you know
mm
mm
you there it is
lovely
hmm
um the it's right above draw there are three thingy if it's way at the bottom under three icons and it's the one that looks like a desk yeah that one there are y s
you just press yeah just click that'll be fine
um yeah use that thing you can go back previous
pardon
oh well okay
ye
double click on it
with the right with the left hand one
there we are
mm hmm
mm hmm
excellent

so um
yes absolutely
ah i can never tell which way to turn these things
lefty loosey righty tighty right lefty loosey righty tighty
oh yes

mm 'kay
um i have nothing on my screen
just a sec
here we are
okay yeah it's fine
okay requirements we have a couple new requirements that i was just e mailed right before the meeting and that we have to keep in in
um in mind as we're creating this we didn't bring it up yet or at all in the meetings so far but we're not gonna work with teletext
because um well it that's been taken over by the internet so we're not gonna worry about um we're not gonna worry
about that
um
it no w d could would you care to explain it
how
okay
interesting okay um well we're not gonna the management has decided we're not gonna work with that um
okay um and we're also gonna w like your question earlier um whether this is going to be t for television video or etcetera
just for television that's what we're focused on um otherwise becomes to complex we wanna get this out um
very quickly we only have a a short amount of time
um and finally there's more marketing i think um our corporate image has to be recognisable so while we're gonna make it look pretty we need to use our colour and our slogan i in the new design
looks like yeah kind of a yellow and black and we have that the emphasis on the r s in um mm hmm
but it's yeah we put the um
fashion in electronics so we gotta keep that in that in mind
yep yep
yeah or ha maybe some buttons could be yellow like we can we can play around with it a little bit
um
okay we need to talk about our functions and our target group we need to decide who our target group is you
um in your analysis of different market um of the marketing you identified that different groups wanted different
things or had certain preferences for example that um that older people didn't really care for um
voice recognition but younger people did um and so who
are we aiming this at
mm hmm it's gonna be twenty five euro remember so um it has to be avai marketable to um whomever it is
well at least right now what we're doing is um deciding on just the remote itself so it will probably be sold separately twenty five euro by itself
now those are that's all specific for speech recognition are we gonna use that as one of our functions
mm hmm
mm
to produce it yes
mm
that's a good thing to keep in mind
upgrade well we can look for we can look at upgrade or we can look at um user friendly
simplification so
uh huh mm
and we also need to talk about if we're only gonna have the very simple ones or also have the other ones just separate somehow or
kind of pull out of the side
mm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
um we have to be careful that that that doesn't impede um the chip transmitting information but um that's gonna be mostly technological thing um
okay um so what are we emphasising
i what in this project
simplicity and fashion
okay those are very good goals i think um that we have to keep in mind in with everything we do simplicity and fashion and
yeah or usability speci however you wanna say that which includes um an emphasis on making the infra red
very functional so that you don't have to travel around a lot
um
i think it's a lot to do with battery but that's just my
mm hmm
so our target group we're saying fifteen to thirty five
s voice recognition which i kind of i kind of feel like voice recognition is not necessary in a remote control like it might be necessary for a t v  but not for the remote c you know seems a little bit
mm hmm yeah and it might be too expensive
mm hmm
yeah

mm hmm
under sixty five okay that's a good start um
i'd say we're uh can we narrow it down to maybe um
teenagers and families
'cause that would go up to like fifty
okay single
it's it's hard to narrow it down
mm hmm
okay
mm hmm
right
mm hmm
mm hmm
so maybe it's more useful to d d to define objectives like fashion and simplicity than to find specific target group as far as age is because yeah things so different will appeal to different people but
okay um oh there're a couple functions do we want something so that do we want some kind of thing to find it if it's lost
like a button on a t v  you can press and it'll ring or something i don't know like or beep
mm hmm
mm
okay we have to we have about four minutes left to define our functions so let's do that quickly um so we want something to keep it from getting lost
and we want
um
we want large buttons for the essential things
large accessible buttons for the essentials
we want a possibility to um to get um
a possibility to get the extra functions
mm hmm
um yeah hidden way
and we also want it to be fashionable which i'm not sure if that's a function so much as a um yeah
mm hmm
okay do it any other essential functions that we need
battery do we need a long life battery
but we might as well
yeah i would imagine just 'cause it is an electronic device the
charging
mm hmm
we have to think about um space in living rooms too like 'cause they're i mean would you put it on top of the t v  i don't know just think okay that's that's a good idea we'll keep it think it's
and maybe fun
okay um 'kay we're gonna conclude now has everyone said their functions and 'kay
um after the meeting we're gonna each complete a sks um a questionnaire and a summaries summary i don't know what summarisation
um and then we'll have our lunch break after that we have thirty minutes of individual work um i'll make sure to put up um
the minutes and the project documentation and including these powerpoint slides if everyone could do that as well that'd be great
um you each have individual actions i  um i d  industrial design you've your components
concept user interface the user interface concept market trend wa watching
and as as per last time you'll get specific incrat instructions from your personal coach e mailed to you
and hopefully i hope next time you'll be able to access more of the web site that they they seem to tell you that you could
it's kinda frustrating but um
be sure to note any frustrations or any um issues that come up in your um in your um summary
mm 'kay
great seeing y'all
looks like there are um looks like there's a second one kind of of mine that's that i didn't do it's from like an earlier project i think so um
under the shared folder i don't know it might not even be under yours as well projects
okay you don't have mine
s
mm
okay well i'll figure that out in the meantime
okay
right
i think you might have to disconnect rose
yeah
i i think you just have to push it in really hard
oh got it
mm neither have i
alright
hmm
'kay
hmm
hmm
mm 'kay
okay great

hmm
yeah i think that could be our selling point
right
hmm right i really can't see what i'm doing so does anyone have a
ah ha look at that showing up already
yeah
alright um
no how do i play again
ah
okay so this is our working design presentation um i had a bit of some issues with this
because i wasn't able to find everything i needed but i guess that's we're still in early stages
um so yeah this is this though th the thing about working design is the what we're trying
to do as a working design is figure out how the aparata apparatus can fulfil its function
um one of the examples that kept coming up for me is that a coffee grinder it works because it converts
electrical energy to grinding the beans and then you put the bean through a filter and that filters out
and then you get coffee at the end that's nice and hot because of the combination of electrical energy and then the other things that are
brought in to make it work don't know if i'm explaining that very well but how do i get to the next s ah
so h the method as um working designers figure out what you need to make it
fulfil this practical function what what needs to be done and how do we convert all the elements
to make that done so wha the easiest thing to do is to break down all the points
at which you need something to happen so you make a schematic of the way that the the energy is converted
tsh towards this practical function and then i think the easiest thing to do is gonna be work on each task separately so um
uh uh
so the findings that i got uh very just very briefly is that you have a choice of
the way that the information is projected to the receiver and in my opinion infra red is
the best way to do that 'cause you don't need a sight line so that's one thing we're gonna work on um the user interface is critical
here because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip that controls that converts the
electrical energy into data which then goes through the infra red so the the chip that
uh i think ian is designing is gonna be crucial
and really it all comes down to the to the user because they're the one that's controlling most of the working design
so the components that we find here are the energy source you know the battery or whatever that's gonna m make it work then
the chip which converts the data the user that's controlling the chip and the infra red bulb that's gonna let us
move the data to the receiver so you have four main components and they are designed
sort of like this you have your energy source right there which then um
brings
uh energy or information to the chip which is also controlled by the users you have energy going to the user who's controlling the chip ooh 's not what i wanted to do uh uh
previous
sorry about that guys
oh
no no no no no okay let's just get back to my schematic here
w yeah yeah i think it's frozen here don't show me that tip again
there we are sorry about this guys i'm kind of pathetic with things like this um alright
so you have your energy source your user interface who's controlling the chip the chip also uses the energy
and the chip through the use of the user interface is gonna control the switch which will work your infra red bulb which
will then bring the data to the receiver so hopefully that makes sense for everyone in my kind of garbled
way this is the the parts of the working design that need to be figured out
and personal preferences besides the fact that i can't spell we need a long lasting energy source
people don't wanna be changing it a lot we need a chip that works well with the user interface that isn't too complicated
we need a straightforward interface like ian was saying simple not overwhelming it with information
and we need a reliable and clear infra red signal so that you're not waving your remote around and having to get frustrated and
go do it by hands so that's pretty much it for the working design
rose do you think you can give me a hand with this
yeah
yeah


it's gonna stick in your head
mm
ooh no signal
okay
uh it's a british thing
no
s
lottery numbers and sport scores
but if you ever see the t v  saying like go to page one sixty on ceefax now that's what they're talking about
i have no idea why we don't have it but
'kay
mm
okay so we want something that looks good
and is yellow
okay
well if we're gonna say that function um fashion we put the fashion in in electronics then you automatically i think a sort of younger group that that's who's gonna be attracted to this
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah that's probably uh a population w quite a little bit of disposable income for use on technology anyway so that might be a fairly good target group for us
mm
to produce it yeah
hmm
but right
well but why are we why are we aiming for a technological advancement everything we're talking about is ease of use
and simple and that doesn't necessarily mean more technology in fact it could use it could
mean not if they might be overwhelmed with with remotes that have too many buttons and too
much technology
yeah simplification they could have a crap remote that came with their t v  that's just impossible to use or maybe it broke or maybe they're just missing it
hmm
ooh
ooh
mm hmm
yeah that's a good idea
mm
good point yeah
yeah mm
the battery and that i think that the chip takes the data and presents it well without sort of scattering
yeah i think so
the quality uh quality of all the components really i mean we can't really do anything shoddy work 'cause it's
gonna be visible down the line
mm mm
yeah
ooh

yeah
i
mm hmm
yeah but i th i think regardless we're we're aiming for the under sixty five or something
or like single professionals or something
yeah
it's really hard to figure out right now
yeah
that's a good point
yeah
mm
yeah t probably
mm
mm
yeah that'll probably be good
yeah
yeah
mm hmm
yeah
alright
battery battery use yeah but i think that goes in with simplicity and ease of use really
yeah
yeah
mm it i think it does i don't i don't think of a way you can operate a chip and convert that much data without without one but you could maybe have it in a little charging station like a mobile phone or like a little cradle for your ipod
you could we could maybe do that instead so you don't ha you got like a rechargeable battery
i dunno that might contribute to less people losing it too if it it stays in one place
mm
yeah that's just off the top of my head
yeah who knows
okay
sounds good

yes i just did that hopefully it is there for people yeah
yeah
okay
technical so in there we have technical functions presentation working design presentation and the functional requirements at least that's what i have in
yeah that's what i have as well r rose so
yeah
okay
yep
well there's a wee a wee plug just just that one there

ah that's it yep
and then you have to press function f  eight i think it is on your laptop
that's it
repetitive strain injury
repetitive strain injury
so if you
cheers
here we go
right so i'm gonna talk about the technical technical functions design of the remote control um
we need to start by considering what a remote control actually is it's a device that allows
us to produce certain effects on our television so i it's basically
a communication device we we tell the remote control what we want to do it sends a message to the television
saying change the channel change the volume uh yeah adjust these settings adjust the brightness
um how do we actually go about designing a new television remote control
first thing to do is to come up with the design specifications we need to know what our final product is gonna be like so
we need a a clear idea of exactly what this product does uh how it works
and what the end user is gonna want from this product
um
oh a way i'd suggest that we could go about this is by designing uh several different prototypes of user interfaces for this product um and then uh trying to get some feedback uh about
h how well these particular prototypes work uh sorta find out what people think of 'em um using a remote control is is quite a subjective experience um
and different different people sort of prefer different things
um we should remember that remote controls are a a fairly standard piece of equipment
when a users using a remote control he or she expects the buttons to be in certain places so in some sense
we're gonna we're gonna have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design uh so
that we're not completely shocking people but i think within that there is also room for us to introduce
novel ideas uh and to make something that's that's perhaps a little bit different something that stands out
um also in in designing the user interface we need to consider practicalities uh the first of these
is is technological ye uh what can we do with the current state of technology as it is the second
is is economic uh we need to find a balance between features and price so as you mentioned things like
voice recognition would would add to the price uh but it would also im improve the design of the product
so i had a look on the on the web uh to see if i could find a few examples of existing
television remote controls in analysing these we can consider what what things what's good
about them uh what things do they get right what's bad about them what's wrong with 'em um how we can
improve on the designs that that that i found and what can we do to make our product
stand out from from the large majority of remote controls
here's two examples uh probably at the extreme ends of the spectrum um on the left
here we've got uh an engineering based design for a remote control
so it's one that's got lots of buttons it's it's fully featured everything you might possibly want to do is there
you know it's got forward backwards up down channel numbers volume uh freeze frame yeah
it's it's fully featured and it might take a while to get to learn to use it but once you've learned it you can
you can do whatever you want with your t v 
the one on the right is a lot more basic it's just got the essential functions of the t v  changing the channel play stop volume
it would be a lot quicker to learn to use it but again th it's it's swings and roundabouts there are disadvantages
you can't use it say to to freeze the television picture uh there's a lot of features that are missing
from that remote control so we've got to to find our find a way of striking a balance between the two
um as i said before remote controls are subjective different people want want different things
um personally wa what i want from a remote control is a device that's simple it it's
easy to use uh it's got big buttons for doing the things i do most often changing the volume changing the channel
it it does everything that i need it to uh as i said before i'm quite lazy i don't wanna walk across the room just to
adjust my television i also want something that that looks cool um and that that feels good that's
ergonomically designed

i think there's there's certainly a market for technology that looks cool and i think that's that's why companies like apple've 've 've made a lot of progress
uh that was just on the d on the company web site yeah

what's up
lefty loosey
uh never heard that before that's good
i'll think of that every time now

you don't have it in the states
oh i didn't realise um yeah it's like a
i suppose it's kind of similar to a very very basic web browser um you have like you have uh
numbers on your remote control uh y and you type in the page number you want so like you type
a hundred on your remote control and this this kind of index appears on the television screen with just
some some text and some very blocky looking graphics on it and you just type numbers to go to different pages
and it gives you information mostly rather boring stuff like what's on t v  next and share prices
and that kind of thing
yep news headlines
it's earl it's pretty old technology it's like nineteen eighties

right
so what's our corporate image like it's it's kind of yellow colour with uh we put fashion in electronics
it's like double r 
yeah

is it is it something that's gonna be sold separately from the television or is it something that comes w with a television 'cause that would affect the way that we market it
right
right okay
yeah
um
i i would say no because it's gonna add too much to the price
especially if we are marketing it as a separate product people are gonna be paying uh
well uh we've got a price limit of was it twelve twelve and a half euros for to produce it and i wonder
if we can get voice recognition into that twelve and a half euros without having to make too many other compromises
yeah
yeah
yeah
the remote there are remote controls like that yeah like some t v s they have a sort of uh a
sliding screen on the remote control of it that hides all the complicated buttons so if you wanna do something complicated
like programme your television or re tune it then you you open up this little hatch or or slide
the screen down and there's all the all the special buttons
yeah
yeah
i think that's a good idea yeah
yeah
si simplicity and fashion
yeah
yeah
yeah
it's yeah it's pretty it's pretty high tech

it's for like the ultimately lazy people who can't even be bothered to pick up the remote
yep
i think the product appeals across a quite a broad range of ages i mean we we said simplicity
is is one of the features so it's going to appeal to people maybe people who have problems
with technology you know people who get scared by having lots of buttons and that might be older people but then we've also got fashion
which is something that definitely appeals to younger people
yeah yeah aim for a an income group
yeah
yeah
yep
yeah
yeah
which are kind of hidden away in some way or
well not hidden but they're uh
they're not as prominent as the main features
we should maybe investigate whether it needs a battery at all
i suspect the remote control does need a battery but
i dunno if you can
yeah
yeah without the energy yeah
yeah that's that's possible yeah
yeah
yep


mm shall we go in the order that you just did it
i dunno
how do i hook my screen up
where does it go mm hmm
hmm i'm not supposed to move this but

where's function
no signal
ah wait 's screw in
push the screw
mm alright
i've never attached to anything
alright so i don't know if you guys are able to get access to um the report that was online or if i'm the only one who is
but i don't even know how to play this
no
alright so we're just gonna talk a little bit about the functional requirements that people specified when
they were asked um i guess real reaction did some market research they had a hundred subjects and their
usability lab and they watched them watch t v  and recorded
the frequency that they used particular buttons and the relevance that those buttons had
what they found was they analysed people's desires and needs focusing on their desires um
people specifically said that they thought remotes were ugly seventy five per cent of the a hundred subjects
noted that and that they more importantly though eighty per cent said that they would be willing to pay more for a fancier
looking remote i don't know anything beyond what fancy means but that's particularly of
use to us i think um also they did some questions on voice recognition and found
that the desire for voice recognition was inversely related to age so younger people
were more inclined to want something with voice recognition whereas the older people in
the like sixty and above segment or so did not really think that they would pay more money for voice recognitions
um people also had certain frustrations that i think that we could try to take into consideration with
our design that being people k um frustrated with losing their remotes
i think over fifty percent of the people mentioned that that was their biggest frustration people are also frustrated
with the difficulty it is to learn how to use a remote and i think that ties back to what you were saying
before just that there's too many buttons it just needs to be easy to use it also mentioned something called
r s i  and i was hoping someone might be able to inform me as to what r s i  is because i don't know
what
ah there we go wow people do not like that so i guess sort of the carpal tunnel type thing
people do not like that um the repetitive use i guess caused a strain um looking at the needs
people specified the problem right now is that people's remotes are not matching
their operating behaviour people are only using ten per cent of the buttons
that they have offered to them on their remote
and what people do most often is changing the channel and changing the volume people also
zap like to change the channel about um sixty five per cent during an hour
of use so we really just need to focus in on those volumes and channel changers
rather than things like the audio settings the screen settings and the channel settings because they're used much more infrequently
and probably just complicate what's going on
so i think that some things that we might wanna think about the idea of an l c d  screen was brought up although they didn't have any details on
what people's preferences on that were so i dunno know if that's coming to me later or something like that but something for us to consider also just
the phenomenon that less is more when it comes to the buttons on the remote or what we wanna make easiest
to use make sure that you know something like an audio setting isn't given
as much importance and visibility on the remote as something like channel changing that's used a lot more often
and basically in order for us to win over to the consumer we just need to focus on what it looks like that it has a fancy
appeal and that it's not ugly and that it feels like the way they're gonna use it so it doesn't give them
any hand injuries or things like that
hmm
yeah have i unscrewed it
here we go
mm hmm
and i think that's in the shared if i did it right if anyone wants to look at it


no
a fashion fashion remote
mm hmm
yeah
so wait did it let you go on the internet or was that just what it let you see
okay 'cause i was like googling and then i'm like wait it won't let me google




yeah that's a good one it'll stick with you
what's teletext
oh oh so
mm hmm

oh
that explains a lot
that's good


mm hmm
mm hmm

yes i do think who's gonna have the money to buy that also that one
the only break down that i was given in terms of age was the voice activation and basically there's a big jump after thirty
five people don't really care if it has voice so it's like basically fifteen to thirty five that
think that that's a good idea i dunno i'm gonna be given any other numbers broken down in terms of age later but if that's
sort of the only quality that we have that is divided into age then we would wanna stick between the fifteen and thirty five range

but what else are we gonna put i mean not that i'm really gung ho about it i don't know what else you can put in a remote to make it
technologically advanced though so like other than just making it look good how is it i mean it can look really great
and still have the same up n down buttons and why's anyone gonna buy a new remote
mm hmm
if someone's looking to buy a new remote don't they want like an upgrade i dunno
mm hmm
mm hmm
can you like i mean this may be too complicated but i wish i had something to explain it like if it was just a simple
either this way or this way that had like the main buttons and then you could like pull something out kind of and like you got the rest the buttons but the rest of them like went
in do you know what i'm saying
mm hmm
'cause then 's like people who don't wanna ever look at them never even have to see them and if you like get the instruction manual
that comes with it and you just don't even read it then you'll never even know that those things can pull out and you're a happy person and everyone else doesn't
have to have like two remotes one that has the easy ones and one that has
more complicated ones but 's all still in one
yeah
i think simplicity fashion
mm hmm
what can you do to like make the infra red more functional like why would it not be i'm just wondering
okay
so 's just the quality of the chip
okay
well i dunno how useful that number is if we're not doing
yeah
yeah i don't
and if the whole idea is you're using a remote then why would you have voice like you know what i mean and then it's like you wouldn't need a remote you'd just talk to your t v 
mm yeah maybe i mean if i get m more numbers i'll e mail you before the next meeting in terms of ages
but this doesn't divide up anything and there was only a hundred subjects also which isn't i mean
really isn't that representative especially if it's a hundred subjects that th they then can subdivide into age groups that means there's very few
in each age group so

twenty to like fifty five
i dunno
well maybe we don't have to defi define the target group by the demographic of age maybe we can define it by like the demographic of
like h t how much money they have to spend or something like that like well obviously it has to be someone who owns a television and like how recently have they bought their television like that sort of thing
yeah
h
i mean like i said before fifty per cent of of the fru f like frustration someone can have that was the biggest one and half the people said that happened and we all mentioned it before we knew about it
and if we're talking about making something easy that sort of goes along with it so it wouldn't be like a random thing to sort of add in it would be relevant to like the overall goal i think so

hmm
on your coffee table it's not like an eye sore that kind of thing
yeah
so you never have to change the battery
mm

it's good
did you um were you able to like put yours in the group folder okay
yep
where is that yours is
i only have three i just have like our three yeah
no but that's 'cause i think yours is in the e mail separate like it's not on the server
but if i open it and then save it probably will be there oh wait never mind you can't save it to the
okay
okay um welcome to our second meeting this is the functional design meeting
and i hope you all had a good individual working time okay let's get started okay here's
the agenda for the meeting after the opening um i am going to
fulfil the role of secretary take the meeting minutes and we're gonna have three presentations one from each of you then
we're gonna discuss some new project requirements um gonna come to a decision on the functions of the
remote control and then we're gonna close up the meeting and we're gonna do this all in about forty minutes
okay first i want to discuss the goals of this meeting first we need to determine the user requirements
and the question that we can ask ourselves is what needs and desires are to be fulfilled by this remote control
and then we're going to determine the technical functions what is the effect of the apparatus
what actually is it supposed to do what do people pick up the remote and use it for
and then lastly we're going to determine its working design how exactly will it perform its functions that's the whole technical side of
'kay i'll just give you a minute 'cause it looks like you're making some notes
'kay
oh well let's go ahead and back previous so what i wanna do right now is hear from all three of you on your research that you just did who would like to start us off
'kay
okay um do you have a powerpoint or no
okay
oh
save it in the project documents okay
mm mm mm
this one okay

okay
okay

right
ready

alright very good presentation thank you you speak with such authority on the matter okay who would like to um follow that one up
now that we've discussed okay do you want me to run it or you wanna okay

functional requirements 'kay
alright now we have courtney with the functional requirements
okay what do you m oh i'm sorry what do you mean by um the current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user like they have to press the buttons
okay
oh right
the buttons
okay
yeah okay
it works ready for the next slide
hmm
it's okay it's very important

could be yeah
oh
i think that's a pretty good guess though
yeah it's okay
okay next slide
user friendly
and so just to just to clarify by speech recognition you mean they would say channel five and the thing would go to channel five
okay
oh that'd be lovely
didn't they um didn't our rival companies manufacture a remote that you would press the button on the t v  and it would the remote would beep so if you have lost it
mm oh yeah that's true we could definitely include that if we wanted to
if it's within our price okay are we ready for our last presentation amber
okay
there we go
'kay
oh my bad

okay
ready
that's okay
hmm

so this would be the front so the red would be the front of the remote though right okay
the l the light up kind of yeah
hmm
it'd probably be lighting up the key too right
'kay
the buttons
okay
yeah definitely 'kay nex r ready
'kay any p 'kay
anything you wanna add for personal preferences though you f you said already that we needed a large on off button you think anything else
okay
mm
okay okay let's talk about all of our
we'll come to decision later about all the components that we need to include let's um wrap up this one
and i'm gonna go back to my powerpoint 'cause we need to discuss the new project requirements which you might've already seen flashed
up on the screen a bit earlier wait come back
alright sorry let's go through this alright here we go new product requirements
first it's only going to be a t v  remote we're trying not to over complicate things
so no d v d  no tivo no stereo it's not gonna be multi functional
hey and we th need to promote our company more so we need to somehow include our colour and our company slogan on the remote
we're trying to get our name out there in the world okay and you know what teletext is
in states we don't have it but um it's like they just have this channel where just has news and weather kind of sports it's very um bland looking it's just text on the screen not even yeah just black with just text
yeah
kind of
yeah it's the whole screen
so anyway
right right but it's becoming out dated now because of the internet nobody needs to go to the teletext channel to check the news and we have twenty four hour news channels now too so those are our new product requirements alright mm hmm
yes it's part of the logo
okay
what we're going to do right now is come to some decisions definitive that we can all agree on about
um the target group and the functions and just definite things that we need to do and then we'll
close up the meeting so alright
whatever
okay
so our target group is you mentioned um older people
would it just be universal for everyone you think because i think even if something has large buttons
as long as they are not childishly large like even technically
non technically challenged people are gonna use it i mean they want something user friendly so
yeah
yeah
okay so we want um for our target group would we say i mean young and old all age ranges all um not kids obviously right
or kids

okay so we're going to go anywhere from kids to adult in the age range um what about
technic technical um specifications like how how technically literate are these people who are going to be using our remote
okay
right okay
so so they need no technical experience to operate
okay and we also need to determine the specific functions of this just to get it
all out on paper so we said it needs to send messages to the t v  needs to change the channel
turn on and off just basic simple stuff like this so if you have something just say it and we'll add it to
my meeting minutes
mm hmm volume
right and we wanna keep um i'll make a note here that we wanna keep the number of buttons down correct because people only use ten percent 'kay
hey what else
um
i think so what do you
a finding kind of device or yeah ho homing device
mm 'kay
okay
right
hmm would that add to our costs at all i wonder
right
okay i i think we can make a decision about that later uh we'll still put that as a point that we need to discuss so that would include battery source
power source rather is it going to have a charger or is it going to be run strictly off batteries and we also need to deal with the issue you mentioned of speech recognition if we want that
mm
you could um we could hook it up oh
mm hmm
and if and if we introduced it when they're this age they're going to probably always buy a remote that has
right
yeah and the speech recognition could be part of the lost and found device too if we said find remote locate remote or something
a certain phrase
then it could beep i dunno just throwing it out there
well
okay anything else we wanna discuss
um

how how yeah how would you leave those out
unless you could say the channel
yeah that's true and also remember that in this day in age we need you know like a hundred button too i used to have a remote that did not even go up past like fifty so i couldn't whenever i got cable i had to get a new t v 
mm get your own remote or digital cable 'kay um
i guess we're gonna discuss the project financing later making sure that we can fit all of the stuff that we want to on our budget um
'kay and don't forget we need to include the colour
of our company and the logo
i'm guessing and the r r 
we could just have the logo in yellow or maybe a yellow light for the keys
right
so we've simplified we don't need all those um play fast forward rewind
or no menu buttons so we've pretty much pared it down to on off volume mute channel up and down um the numbers
yeah
um can we go back to i'm gonna look really quickly back at those
examples and see if there is anything which one is yours technical functions or functional requirement okay
the t v  i think that that's fine just for the t v  i mean how often does the average user need to do that kind of stuff
hmm
couldn't we do that all through one button something a menu button that pops up with a menu on the t v  that says you know audio video whatever language you know
for the menus
that's true
something that looks mayb you know
y right right right right that one
right in the middle perhaps
yep
good
anybody have anything else they'd like to bring up in this meeting
okay get out of here let's go back to the meeting closure then and see what we need to do next mm
alright after this meeting we're gonna be sent a questionnaire and summary again which we need to
reply to that e mail and then we're gonna have lunch break and after lunch thirty minutes of individual work time um
i'm gonna put the minutes i put the minutes for the first meeting already in the project documents folder if you'd like to review them and i'm gonna type up the minutes
for this one as well um here's what we're each going to do the i d  is
going to work on the components concept um u i d  the user interface concept
and you're going to do some trend watching
'kay specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach and if anybody has anything they would like to add no okay well this meeting is officially over
thank you all
did you send it
okay great

we only use ten per cent of our brains
yeah
do we really need t to provide more information on what r s i  is
yeah i'm just trying to move it
'kay i think it should be there working design
'kay uh i didn't get a chance to complete this one 'cause some of the tools that i was
given were frustrating uh okay so method
method of our design i think i just start listing th some of the things that we actually need to put into this we need a
power source we're gonna need a smart chip if we're gonna make it multi functional um extra functions
will probably need an additional chip either that or the smart chip will have to be extremely smart
usually a smart chip is just a chip that's been programmed and designed so that it can complete a fair range of functions
i wouldn't think so 'cause we could probably get it from like in bulk from a a newer company and they tend to sell their chips pretty cheap
um yep nothing here
um power source i figured batteries 'cause they're easily available typically
a remote has either two double a s or four triple a s sometimes three uh it really kinda depends
on the size of the actual remote itself um a large on off button demographically
we're moving towards an older generation of people so a large on off button would probably be good
selection button for various entertainment devices so you want something that will permit you to select the d v d  player
or the t v  or the stereo system
um smart chip that perverts uh that permits sorry universal application again
something that'll allow us to skip over between devices and that's kinda it uh this is my fifty second design
power source over here we're gonna have a switch obviously between the power source and the rest of it and you're
gonna need the switch um extra bulb could just be for flashiness
um subcomponent which would be like a way of diverting the power
to different parts of the the device um the chip and of course the infra red bulb so it can
communicate with the various devices that it needs to talk to
this is just like a rough schematic so this is the internal workings
yeah
yeah so you don't have to stare at that infra red 'cause you know when the battery starts dying in your remote currently you have to actually stare at that bulb and go okay when i push this button is it working we can skip that whole thing yep
so you can put it in the dark
yeah that's it
i think that that's a good idea because you know that's one of the most important buttons
okay
you can also get the kind of the t v  guide so
it's the entire screen is just running information at random seemingly
okay so do we have to include the company colour within that
mm well even if we kept the regular standard size of remote if we reduced the buttons down to the ones that people are saying
that they use the most often and a couple extra 'cause they're saying they only use ten per cent of them then
we should be able to accommodate fairly decent sized buttons
most of them will intuitively pick it up though

how 'bout little to no because there is no way that you are gonna be able to make it no
do we want this thing to be able to be found easily
and
like if this is gonna get lost underneath the coach how are we going to accommodate the quick ability to find it
what if we gave it a charger and on the charger just like a phone like you get a portable phone and it's got a charger and if you d leave your phone somewhere you push the button to find it and it finds th the phone beeps for you
it's useful for the remote phone
yeah
rechargeable batteries are cheaper usually

yeah
i think people would find that too foreign
it's when we get satellite
yeah
yeah 'cause i don't have any material pricing information available to me at the moment so
r  the double r 
or is the l
yeah yellow could be and it could doesn't have to be huge
mm hmm
i had something but i forgot


i don't mind going first
yeah it's in the should be in the m project
you know you could you could do it yourself actually
put it in project documents yeah
sure
yeah
okay
um well the function of a remote control as what uh we've
been informed is basically to send messages to the television set for example switch it on switch it off
go to this channel go to channel nine turn the volume up etcetera
um some of the considerations is just um for example the what it needs to include it's the numbers you know zero to nine so you can move to a channel the power button on slash off
the channel going up and down
volume going up and down and then mute
a mute function and then functions for v h s  d v d  for example play rewind fast forward stop
pause enter and enter would be for like you know the menus and then other menus
for d v  as well as t v  whether that means like um we can go and decide the brightness
of the screen things like that all the more complicated functions of menus
and we can decide if that's what we want um if we want to include that on the remote if that's something that would stay on the t v  itself for example
these are two examples um and you can see on the left it's got a lot more buttons and
i don't know if you can read it but it says step go to freeze um slow
repeat program mute and so those are some of the buttons and so it gives you an idea of s
one example and then on the right it's a lot more simpler it's got volume it's got the play the like circle
set which is play rewind but it's also what is fast forward is also like next on
a menu so you have functions that are d uh duplicating
and you have a mute button and then the numbers and the eject and the power button so that gives you two different kinds a more complex and more simple version
okay
and then lastly it's just the questions that we want to consider like what functions do we want it to include and how simple
complex it should be and what functions it needs to complete uh
what are needed to complete insulation process 'cause you know that's something that also has to be considered and it's gonna be hopefully
a one time thing when you set it up it should be set to go but we have to include the functions that can allow
it to set up i in the first place
so that's it
mm left
wait
and that meaning what
okay

right
only use ten percent of the buttons
lost
s
wait is that like your
ergonomics like your hand movements or something
like
channel volume power

it's like if you're holding it


to just say where are you and thing beeps you know
yeah
it's kinda like what the remote phone used to do
you know like go to the base yeah
working design

help me

well how much extra would the additional chip be is that gonna push us over our production costs
mm hmm





yeah that's gonna be what's communicating with the t v  but the other bulb i think is good to just to indicate i'm doing something it's sort of like a reassurance
yeah

just
well should it be larger buttons in general you know like uh the examples that i had they were swi quite small so should we try and go for something that has l larger buttons
ovals
yeah yeah


yeah
i know

yeah it's like black black and white kind of
it'll give you the sports
except the entire screen
you can pick sports you can pick the news you entertainment you know it's like
yeah
company colour being yellow
mm hmm
it's gonna make it nicer
yeah
we should go for the lowest denominator
high school educated
well it's channel on off button volume mute
um


oh right yeah okay
tracking
but you got a base
well if you have the base you could start putting in a charger and then you have a different kind of battery
yeah
well then we could if we have the speech recognition then we can start aiming at a like another kind of more handicapped disabled uh demo demographic

well
well then then do you put the voice recognition do you put the r like receiver on the actual television in the base
or in the actual remote 'cause then you've already got remote in your hand why you just gonna speak to the remote whereas if you just
speak in general and you don't have to have the remote in your hand and like talk at it
still fifteen minutes
um
well do we wanna include the numbers like zero through nine can we conceive of leaving them out
yeah like you have one two three four five six seven eight nine zero
well i don't know i mean if you can like well i don't know if there's just a way of leaving them out
the colour being yellow
and how do we
can't make it entirely
well if you have like a hang on if you have this sort of strip kind of down at the bottom the base of it just like yellow with the r r 
right yeah

two examples yeah
oh it's a yeah
well the other option is sort of like down at the bottom like farther away you just have this sort of box inset where it's like the buttons that you don't use as much but occasionally you will use
and so it's like
i don't well i don't know
right
well that could be no you could just double up with like the channel or the volume buttons
channel is just up and down
and then add a
yeah
so we just have it like add a menu button then for the various things needed including v voice recognition if we have any like settings for voice recognition now
included in the menu
do you want us to do our powerpoints now or
i can go
yeah you should run it
mm yes
yes okay so we tested a hundred subjects in our lab and we
just we watched them and we also made them fill out a questionnaire and we found that the users are not
typically happy with current remote controls seventy five percent think they're ugly eighty percent want
they've are willing to spend more which is good news for us um if we make it look fancier
and basically w we just need something that really i mean there's some other points up there but they
it needs to be snazzy and it but yet simple so that's really what we need to do
and we need we need it to be simple yet it needs to be high tech looking so
like
they like i guess use the buttons a lot yeah
i don't know it's from my uh research
my team wasn't very clear that's okay
i i think it's like the engineering versus user whereas like the engineering she showed that the
engineering ones are more complex and users don't really need all of the buttons that are
contained on there because they only use ten percent of the buttons really
good point it's a necessary evil
mm hmm and so people say that they typically lose it as you yourself
know because you probably lose your remote control all the time much like any small appliance like a cellphone and
they we need something simple because most people well thirty four percent say that it's just too
much time to learn how to use a new one and we don't want to go we don't want to vary too far from the normal standard remote
but i mean they do need to be able to identify it and r s i  i'm not very sure what that is
yes it is important for the remote control world
sh
uh possibly
uh yeah that's what my web site said i
don't know
yeah i would assume so i think we're supposed to know it as remote control experts but
also s so the channel the volume and the power buttons are the most important on our company
website you can find like the specific statistics concerning to how much each button is used
but those are the definitely the top ones
yes
and so personally i think that we need a modern eye catching design but it it really needs to be simple so
saying from y your slide your presentation the engineering versus the user specified
remotes i think that we should go with something that's more user friendly where the engineering ones the boxes tend to
make it look more complicated than it really is um the functionality of the product really needs to be considered
as to like what type of buttons do we really need on it
and it needs to be open to a wide range of consumers so even though we need a small number of buttons we
also need to take in like are most people going to be using it for a d v d  player a tivo
what what exactly are we using it for as well as the age range so we need a hip
but not a corny marketing scheme for promoting our product and also we found our team
found that speech recognition is it's like an up and coming thing they really consumers
are really interested in it and since our findings found that people are willing to pay more money for a remote
for it to be more high class we could consider it
i guess so yeah
yeah i guess we can interpret it like we can just try out different types of speech recognition within our remote programme
oh that's fine
what exactly is a smart chip
so what exactly we are looking at is this like the front of the remote
oh okay
like that we know the battery's working
okay
yeah
yeah and that's good we should make it glow in the dark
mm 'kay
i think we should like i think that would be in a as in like in for the design sorry um i think we should definitely go with buttons that don't look like a normal remote 'cause most remotes have small square buttons i think we should do something like maybe bigger and round like bubbles
what is it
like running along the bottom
wait is it like the weather channel where it's got like the ticker running on the bottom or something
so it's like a separate channel from like what you're watching
okay
no kids need to know how to use a remote i would think they gotta change between disney channel cartoon network
yeah i think we need it all
um i would say we should say dumber than the average person
yeah
and channel yeah those are the most important ones
yeah
sure yeah
i need we we need a like homing device
because people really are looking for a remote that's more high tech
do you think people'll really go for that though
because
yeah
i would think so because you'd have to develop a base
hmm
right
do w
well th there's the people who desire speech recognition there's the different demog demographics have different desires i don't know if you guys ge
it wouldn't copy onto the the thing 'cause it's black but all the different age groups have different desires for speech recognition so basically older people don't really care
it's really the people twenty five to thirty five i feel those are the people that really watch a lot of t v  though they're the ones that get addicted to soap operas and
just sitcoms and stuff
right
so
right
yeah

wait on the remote itself
well we definitely need those
yeah you definitely need
wait
i feel like a ye i feel like a yellow one would be too garish
or put like stripes oh yeah yellow lights
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah audi audio settings and screen settings we need those like audio settings mono stereo pitch screen settings like brightness colour or do we just want that accessed accessed from the television itself
yeah 'cause we need to we definitely need to have buttons for like sub titles and things like that it's 'cause the foreign film market is expanding
and stuff and like on television like i know f k living in los angeles it's tons of spanish
network television if it has english sub titles it's definitely helpful
so we need up down and side to side buttons
yeah okay
okay yeah
such as yeah the one the one over there on the left the engineering centred one
ooh i just got an idea for a design
okay almost there
yeah yeah
okay

yeah there's good news oh
oh
cutbacks

hmm
okay
oh
um maybe we should bring so that the camera can see yeah
okay



mm
oh yeah yeah
this one is uh i suppose for the younger audiences
a a more friendly type of
right right it's to uh induce more television watching i suppose or
yeah
say it for the camera
right right
yep
it won't stand
just let it lie down it wont stand


what's on the uh on the left
okay
w why is the uh double curved two of them
is i
mm

'cause that's the uh the biggest expense there right got two of them
okay well we can work around that um
cut things out
but you think it should be one
okay
yeah

yeah so we're
we should fire the accountants
fire the accountants
ah yeah we could add things
maybe if you click back in that bottom right cell where you're starting from and then use the arrow keys does that work no mm
is it the other shift button maybe
did you try both shift buttons it could be the other side

that's too bad
oh
yeah i think we have a a winning product

great leadership
yeah yeah
these pens are are neat though

okay

uh so let's talk about our bonuses and the raises we're getting for this right
right right
uh maybe we should start cleaning up the clay


something we should get
oh ok


uh
anybody
clay covered banana
blue
it's fun to touch

do we have the uh the marker for the board
there it is
no that's false
uh
it's hard to know i i give it a two
okay
um yeah i think i it might even exceed it um
but i guess there is a kind of a shortage of buttons
um i'm gonna give it a two two







what are we doing
we're gonna average them
okay so seven fourths about one point f one point eight
okay

yeah round it up to two so trends
can you explain what you want us to write there
how it how conforms to the current trends

'kay as far as the uh technology it its' got the latest trends in speech technology but it's missing the screen as we said um but it does have the push buttons or the scroll buttons
um but it doesn't have that fancy solar power or the the vibrating energy mechanism so i give it a a four i'd give it a kinda middle of the road for
for technology


yeah
well it was yellow
well i think it's the the remote control conforms to the the company strategy is that the question

um
yeah
i'll go with two
so one and a half
a two

yep
s
okay

uh
hmm
e excuse me i forgot my
copy
no not mine yet

yeah
uh can i have
oh sorry s



mm hmm
mm
and double curve on both sides
curve yeah this is double curve no this is double curve it this one is single curve
'cause this is single curve this is curved on both sides
so double curve
like this one curve on this side one curve on that side hmm hmm
maybe
mm should
uh you can do one thing you just select one box outsi yeah this box then move it with the help of this okay just uh just uh okay just a minute
okay no input like this shift no it's not
yeah it's not working should we ask meli should we ask our technical expert
melissa

yeah
yeah we

yeah
yeah these are new ideas like glow in the dark or something like that we discussed all the new ideas but of course
we couldn't reach any proper goals we couldn't use these but we h we are using these scroll buttons
like this these are new ideas we and new shapes everything at le yeah
hmm
hmm


so
so
uh brian have you have you finished uh mine needs also this
at last mine is also the presentation
yeah yeah
s

uh is the project evaluated that is mine
yeah

so yeah
so
so now is the final evaluation final evaluation of the uh uh of our product how we are going to
means uh at what standard what standard whether it meets our standards or not
how mu what rating we will give to these products so of course this is will be a team work w we together
have to decide wha what rating we will give to this product and everything so what methodology
i will tell you on what basis we are going to discuss all this
we will give the rating to this product based on the user requirements whether it meets the user requirements
or not this product then trends whether it is as fashion
trends or not means because we have already stated that people do
prefer fashionable things nowadays so this is also an important factor for our evaluation also
then marketing strategy of the company as we have already discussed that our company is quite
in the market not only in terms of providing quality products not only in pro providing latest technologies
but also in terms of providing environmental s
yeah so but also in terms of providing environmental safe products uh yeah like uh keeping uh keeping in mind all the safety issues so
now comes the criteria rating with seven point scale i'm having this scale this scale so we have to do it on a board
the user requirem i think

thank you
so
so these are the three crite criterias for our evaluation of our product
first of all uh comes user requirement so we will see whether this product meets
all user requirements or not i i will first i would like to have your views what do you think
whether it meets all user requirements or not
s
so what do you think you will personally give seven uh

uh one is means highest ranking okay but i think highest ranking is seven or one
okay right right so it's one for from your point of view and what do you say our industrial expert
uh d you can you can tell on on the like i think she has given her views on the basis of design
because she was our i interface expert but you can give your views based on technology whether the technology
meets the requirements of the customers or not
two and what about uh you brian you will go for one
okay uh for me personally it is everything
fine it may be having good design it may be uh meeting all the requirements of the customers like technology wise
price wise but there is one thing which limits the customers like we are having only two three designs
like we are having one banana design and the other one is orange and
uh yeah lower end and the third one is what you ge uh that is not a f fruit look but if
a person doesn't like banana or orange you are limiting him no don't buy our product because
we are l we like this only so we are showing our preference for particular fruits two
or three kinds rather and yeah so
uh no uh personally as a marketing expert i don't believe that because whatever companies
they launch their products in the shape of fruits they give a range of products a range of shapes like if we see
look at the smallest thing toffee chocolates they give a variety of different things some children like to buy banana
shape some apple shape some even pineapple shape some orange shape so you can what shape
a person will like so in this case giving only one or two choices we are lim limiting our customers
and by limiting them we are limiting our sales limiting our profit also
uh maybe okay but i will i will personally won't give it beyond three so we can
yeah on an average we can think three four sevenths maybe
three or four uh no sorry it should be
no sorry sorry sorry sorry we are doing a very wrong thing yeah yeah we are taking everything and that's i have taken
it very wrongly yeah uh three four four two six seven seven sev yeah one pe exactly so
we can say one or two because it is one point eight uh two so we
will do two yeah so where were the trends
sorry
yeah again the the fashion trends this also like whether it it will be fashionable to have these products in the uh as a fruit shape or something uh

okay yeah uh


okay uh personally i wi
uh i think that in terms of trends these products are quite good like these products are in
fruit shape because that wha people now our fashion trend shows that people like everything all f
everything that is being advertised like clothes shoes and everything is being advertised in the form of fruits and vegetables
or getting them or showing some association with them
so and in this way our product is good and the second thing now people don't want any complicated
or bulky products and ours is quite simple and quite handy so that
is also ef that also our product meets the f the fashion uh trends of the market
and yes it is cus spongy also so they can play with it it's quite good
so then i think maybe i can give it two so
four five ten thirteen thirteen so we can is it fine
so what about company strategy

okay
so what about you brian
yeah and me also like this product me uh me
uh me uh this meets all company strategy like our product should be as per customers' requirement
as per latest technology and it should be environmental safe so since our product meets
all these requirements so i would also prefer to give it rank one so four
six six
half so we can say two or one okay so th seven seven
uh overall we are getting two something but we can round it as two
yeah so i think overall uh evaluation of our product is quite good so we can launch it yeah
so yeah great
okay we'll sta i'll use the powerpoint i guess how was that was that fun
okay
uh oh i've forgotten to mail you the minutes but i will do upsidaisy um um we yeah
alright okay yeah
he's gonna get his pen
um will you guys first with your prototype
um before we get to the good news
uh we have budget problems
i'm afraid you're all sacked oops i don't even have this on


okay have you got a presentation to make no okay so it's just your your show


three oh
tomato what tomato i don't recall a tomato
ah i see okay
mm hmm
logo
okay brilliant
okay
okay so the buttons would be like you know individual users or yeah
alright okay
right
that's groovy
well i like the feel of it i like the feel of it
at oh dear
alright okay
okay brilliant mm
okay nice and obvious there if it's standing up i guess yeah
oh right okay brilliant like that from its centre
where you're yeah uh were you're holding it kind of
mm hmm
yeah okay
yeah okay yeah scale model yeah
mm hmm
alright excellent
okay
no it's out of the way as well i suppose so
excellent
yep
okay so so barney the banana
ah excellent just what we need
lo sort of loch ness banana
cool yeah well nice to have uh options at least 'kay and
oh there are issues oh there are issues
um main problem that we have unfortunately being finance
uh let's just enter in the um evaluation criteria um unfortunately
the unit we are currently going to produce minus the extra scroll buttons uh it's gonna cost us fourteen point six euros
so we have to rea sorry i've accidentally highlighted somehow um there we go
oh god why is it doing that
there we go so basically um in order to save our two euros
um i was thinking
that we could have essentially the same shape but just have it flattened
um
yeah i mean it's already got a kind of cool shape so but it wouldn't have to be curved sort of in and out and by doing so oh no hold on doesn't save us quite as much
i don't know what's going on with this again
oh good point
um
that's sort of curve in and out
no i think it means double curved as in um like uh a single curve on that bottom half and the double curved would be if it was that similar curve upward okay i might be wrong though
i don't think that counts as a curve i think that's just a shape
a curvature is like the this case
yeah and why why i've got it two i don't know i can't seem to select any more however

right no
it's meant to be one yeah i don't know why i put two in there but um hold on till i find it i think this shift button might be stuck again
no maybe the shift button's stuck in um okay so that would take away three which would give us
oh that's fine
eleven uh eleven euros sixty
um
we cou oh not quite have the scroll wheel unfortunately what

yeah
yeah i know that just extends it as well i don't know
it one of the buttons is sticking i don't know
no it's 'cause the uh the shift button's stuck or something

no that's fine um we've worked out what it would be anyway
yeah
cancel piss off
oh well never mind um
right so that's finances and i dunno what we what could we reckon we could add
um
well i suppose that's our that's that's our design that we've got so
yeah
yeah yeah
well that's that's uh okay so project evaluation we have under twelve euros fifty project process how do we think that went
are we happy
okay
evaluation
oh we've been writing this up for m months
uh room for creativity were we happy with that
no i mea i think it means sort of individually
yes no maybe okay groovy so uh we're just gonna uh yeah okay teamwork leadership sorry
thank you very much you're all get you're all getting a raise uh teamwork i thought went well yeah
uh and well means yeah the technical stuff was brilliant let's buy more uh right um i don't know what new ideas found means to be honest
mm hmm
mm 'kay groovy so just general thumbs up for all of us then that kind of
unfortunately is too quick uh
i suppose yeah um
that's it um i think another couple of days holiday pay might be well in order for all of you uh let's see if i can get this bloody thing to work whoops

does it go back in does it reusable
i don't know what this is but it's really really annoying
uh huh
um i have yes
huh
oh right okay you've got more okay sorry uh it didn't bother to tell me that on this
thing
is it
okay
doesn't tell me
oh you're doing that
we evaluated ourselves we thought we were great

mm
o okay hold on
i wonder w which cell do i want

okay i didn't realise you had that bit

okay
okay

alright okay the board working again is it

uh


yeah
when the user requirement is essentially just to operate the t v  so yeah of course we haven't actually got a working model yet
one yeah
no it's it's like true is one end and false is the oth


oh i'll go for a one
basic requirements but of the pro of the project
yeah th

come on that was the tha

'kay
being fruitist




he's a tough cookie

six five or six
oh i see

yeah i am sort of pret uh just the fruit does me in i mean uh it might
it might be trendy to some but i'm just not swallowing the fruit so um uh also uh i would have liked to have seen the l c d  screen in it um so yeah i'd say about four as well



yeah yeah
um yeah a three
pretty much kept to the company strategy so i would go for a
a one as we not only kept it but we were limited by
cool groovy
cool
brilliant


in which case we are done
'cause we've evaluated and we are within budget

champagne lunch anyone
okay
mm very fun
oh right okay
mm
okay sure
we made three for you
um one's based on the banana one's based on the tomato and the other one is st
look oh yeah well yeah we had v some red left over so okay so this is the um
non to non uh no buttons one or as mm few buttons as possible
mainly speak recognition the yellow there is the um the slogan yeah that we need to incorporate
it's very simple if you do need buttons you can flip it over and there's some there um
but mainly it's speech recognition
yeah
yeah and yeah they might project things onto the screen which you can do on there mm
i'm not sure about that um and this one is the one w more like the one w that we
looked at earlier yeah you guys can have a look at that if you want
yeah sure um that one is oh no it's delicate
that's that's already got its stand that one that's it stand it does also lie flat but that's the that yellow stand there represents the the charging stand um the black on the back is the slogan
uh yeah that well we did think of that
yeah if it's standing up it's it's on there but also we're gonna have the company name on the front which
is the little black kind of line in the middle so um and that's the
um transmit the l e d  thing these are the s two scroll ones which we thought could be channel up and down
and volume up and down we n were weren't sure about putting them there because um i
it's it kind of could get bashed
yeah well if you hold it you can you all can hold it is it does actually feel quite ergonomic if you've got small hands
um obviously i don't think that's real sized it would have to be a bit bigger okay
um that's a speaker at the top so you can speak into it like a little walkie talkie as well for speak recognition
um and um then the buttons yeah kind of self explanatory just buttons
whenever you need them tried to keep it simple oh that's the charging base prongs at the bottom
we used those and um then the big red button in the
middle is the on and off one it's not in the traditional place but um it's quite an obvious place
so there we go and and um we have the banana based one too

yeah

mm hmm
yeah
so are there any um improvements or issues or

oh
oh
ooh
mm hmm more like a traditional remote control
mm hmm
mm hmm
like an s  shape
okay
okay
okay
mm hmm
cool
cool
so we could even add something

well maybe we could add something but maybe if what do you th we're trying to save money so
yeah if we're happy with the design there's no point in spending money if we don't have to but if there is anything you think we've
missed out there then you know feel free to add it maybe i mean obviously it would be bigger so there might be more space for
the the slogan on the front because it's not in an ideal place right now
mm
i think it went quite smoothly
w i think we were very creative
oh right okay
mm hmm
excellent leadership
yeah everyone got enough input i think
yeah
mm hmm
yeah
okay well um

mm
yeah maybe

oh you got a presentation sorry
yeah
mm love to eat that now kind of a green banana now
it's this as well sorry we forgot to mention it'll be made out of kind of a rubbery latex new material that we've got i've got

yeah
oh could you pass the tomato please sorry thank you
mm hmm
mm hmm
sorry sorry carry on
mm hmm
okay
um

mm hmm
um i think
yeah it did it had all the basic buttons that they needed as well as
the uh new technology that people said they wanted um so
does it work yeah so
i would say seven seven is good yeah isn't it i can't true or false no sorry tr one is true
yeah
okay so one
yep
mm yellow
uh huh
uh huh
okay
is that no is that not trends
mm hmm
mm hmm
uh huh
but in electronics i think it's not q always quite so um you don't always have so many choices
as with chocolates i think you know if you're going to buy a t v  maybe a company'll have
that you're going to choose from a company'll have two or three choices but they're different designs we
were coming up with one product
no i mean uh obviously your opinion i'm just trying to
okay
what are we doing
adding them up
oh
okay
okay yeah
mm hmm
okay well um going on uh the specifications that we had that fruit and vegetables
are quite popular and that people like something that is good to look at
and not many buttons i would give it um well because it's hard
to make a fruit good to look at that that looks cool you know so i would actually
give it a three tha three or four i'm not sure
three go for three that's fine
mm

yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
um
yeah the company strategy okay um there was lot of discussing that was good um i feel i got my say um so i'd give the company strategy
a
two
okay is it okay
okay so

one or two one okay just leave it it's fine
mm
yeah one
okay
woo hoo
cool
yeah


and then you have to place your laptop exactly on the marked spot
it's important to place your laptop exactly on the marked spot over here
no yeah try the power button
huh
yeah my name is name
yeah everybody's ready great well welcome to the kick off meeting i uh forgot to put my name over here it's uh it's martin
uh so you all know
well this is the agenda for today well the opening is what i'm doing right now uh we gonna do some acquaintance acquaintance things uh give some um
examples of the tool training project plan discussion and the closing we have twenty five minutes
okay the project aim is to design a new remote control uh some of the oje objectives are that is has to be original trendy and user friendly
so now we all know what our
goal is um i oh forget i forget the whole acquaintance part but we we all know each other we all know each other's names joost guido antek
okay i think we uh al already uh been through that part okay it consists of uh
three levels of design uh we begin with the functional design then we go to the conceptual design
and the detailed design every uh level of design consists of some individual work and we uh
close it with a meeting you all received an email with a example of our explanation of what uh
the particular level of design uh means to the different uh functions and uh you
p you probably read that already so i don't have to tell you about that
okay first we're gonna um uh gonna try some different things with the tools
we have over here so you get acquainted with these uh um uh meeting tools we have the smart boards
uh the thes those two boards this is the presentation boards wh which one i'm using right now you can uh
um there's a document folder called um the sh shared document folder you can upload your
uh documents to that folder and then you can open them over here so you can do your powerpoint presentations on this screen
we also have the white board uh we're gonna skip through th
no no just on the on the screen over there
oh no probably is but i don't know if the software is on the laptop is is if it's mainly a thing for in the meeting so i don't think it's i don't know if it's important
this an explanation of the smart boards there is a tool bar over here
it's quite simple you have the the pen function eraser function it's like a very simple uh paint
application uh we well we use the same file during uh the whole day and uh you
can make new sheets by uh by pu puttin pressing on the blank button
it works like this
oh if pen is selected yes oh no no
it's not
but it is pen
it's not working like a pen yet
huh
huh
it's doing some stuff now so you can use a pen you can use an eraser
and you can make new uh fi uh new blanks and you can change uh the line width and the colour of the pen by pressing on forward which y you have to select pen format
and then select current colour or line width
so it's quite easy
uh well now you're all uh acquainted with the different tools
right we're gonna try out the electronic white boards uh every participant should draw his favourite animal and some of its favourite
characteristics on blank sheets with different colours with different pen widths uh i'll
start off then i'll use this uh same sheet alright
oh let me think
different colours
oh
well i'm gonna draw um a p piranha uh a fish
uh

mm hmm
i'm gonna use some different colour now some a little white
looks like a fish
think it is
oh
oh
uh colour
this is black
i think so
oh
oh this is just uh
useless uh
drawings but oh teeth i need teeth

well they're not supposed to be green or whatever colour this is
okay
what was uh i have su to sum up its favourite characteris well i like its uh sharp razor sharp teeth
plus uh the the big uh forehead and uh a small uh well a small actual face
and i like its overall uh aggressive look and
well that's what i like about uh piranha i think that's kind of what uh the intention should be
well who wants to be next
you go guido okay
uh make a new sheet uh it's by pressing on blank yep
yep
and uh so in the format menu you can choose the different uh colours and uh pen widths



well tell us something about uh your favourite characteristics of these uh particular birds


oh okay okay
okay
no uh it's clear
n no no
we get your point okay who wants to be next

oh


i'll do so


okay
well you can have a piranha at home
huh


i don't think uh i don't think uh darwin would agree with that
okay
what do you like about it then
oh okay okay okay okay and then we are uh through the tool training i guess
okay this is uh something about the project finance the selling price of our remote control is gonna be twenty five euros
and our profit aim is fifteen million euros we're very ambitious on this one the market
range is international so it's gonna be sold world wide and the production cost should be a maximum of twelve
euro fifty per remote control so that's clear yeah
okay we're now gonna discuss some stuff when well we're gonna brainstorm about uh what kind of kemoro
romo remote control it's gonna be uh well tell me about your experiences with the remote controls
do you have uh know what good experiences with remote controls or do they annoy you sometimes
are they difficult to understand or maybe they don't interact with different kind of uh
equipment very well
yeah okay
okay
different functions of of uh
okay
yeah
okay
and uh is it gonna be a remote control that's um what it can be used for different kind of equipment like your t v  and your home stereo uh
mm hmm
mm hmm
but uh the d v d  players and home cinema sets often double as stereo hi fi sets probably it's what from my experience
okay
but we gonna
oh it is only for televis
so wha what
what wha what uh what document
but where where did it uh where did you find that
oh okay
yeah but most television remote controls support other functions as well so we can no we have to think about that
okay uh but uh we've gonna put some a uh is is it so user friendliness is a is a pri
priority in this case or
okay
well this the maybe is uh some aspect of the uh or or some point at at which we can excel by making it very useful that w well then you're you're the usability uh man so this uh gonna be a very important task for you then
okay well other ideas how can we make it trendy or something do uh by just sh shape and the look of it
maybe a can opener underneath it i don't know or someth something special like uh m p  three player inside of it or uh oh well then the production costs are gonna be too high probably
okay maybe with different type of fronts or uh well m has to be something spectacular or uh one which makes it we gonna skip back to the goals probably uh
original trendly and user friendly well we al also already talked about user friendliness no well something
trendy and original well that that goes hand in hand i guess when something is original it tends to be trendy
probably or we should make it combination of that
'kay so you the um technical part of the process is something
you're gonna look after for so you have to think about what kind of uh equipment you want to uh
you know you want to manage with it well and that's an important part for you then with gogors regards to the
user friendly part of it
well and you uh should look out for what makes it trendy well you know y like some special feature or some does it does it gets some gadgetness or something
okay
well the closing next meeting starts in thirty minutes individual i think so the the industrial designer will w or the working design of course we will uh
already s said that the user interface designer is it a user inter
user interface the technical functions design and the management expert of uh the marketing expert user
requirements specifi well this one was already clear to us specific instructions will be sent to you by
your personal coach i don't know how much time we have left oh not many i guess we started at twelve
oh and what does it said
w
okay well um
no we're uh ahead of schedule then
yeah close it
i'm gonna make some minutes or take some minutes
and uh it's it's clear you can put the stuff in the project documents presentations you can all or we're all uh
yeah yeah but we're all familiar with uh uh microsoft powerpoint are we yeah okay i'm gonna wri uh write some stuff down and then we're ready
or we can leave already i guess or uh or sh or should we uh or is important that we leave at exact uh
okay

yes
we'll see each other in uh thirty minutes
yeah good luck

okay
no that's okay
joost your mouse
no mouse needed
mm
a touch pad
slap it
is

um
f  five
f  five
i don't


you've got your name
hope it working
never close your laptop
yeah

okay
what is your name
antek ahmet and joost
okay
yeah
yes
can we see the white board on our laptops no i saw i saw the file the smart board that x b k  but
okay

with that pen
mm
mm
little bit slower

piranha okay


oh

yellow

hmm
different
okay
i will try yeah i will try uh
blank
okay then pen again
okay
okay um
control
uh
ah purple
um i don't know what my uh favourite uh animal is but the easiest animal i can think is is a bird uh i will
that's my bird yeah isn't it quite it's a little bit light

uh another colour maybe a red one
a small one uh line width
two three oh that's okay
that's another one ano
uh uh it's a yeah it's uh the most simple uh
animal i know i think um i don't know maybe because uh there's
there's some s uh free uh maybe in the sky or something like that maybe a little bit yeah i don't know
so more uh birds okay okay okay

m
pictionary
a cow

okay
yeah it's little bit hard
orange of course

uh yeah yeah true






a little bit yeah
don't mess with my birds yeah

cat




okay

okay
hmm
different
yeah
but isn't it
it's only for television i thought not
i thought it was only for television so so we probably don't have to have to uh have the functions for d v d  player or v c r 
uh in the email i thought it said uh yeah television remote control
true yeah
true
yeah yeah
yeah
true
oh my god
okay
for the bear uh
i i uh no i think it
uh i th i think yo we have to keep it simple to get a whole market it's international so we have to use a standard
hmm
use friendly
yep
yeah yeah yeah interface d
oh i don't
i didn't get a message
oh the project manager
okay
okay
yeah
i don't think oh

i will need it

i've lost my screen uh

yes
i closed the
no
yes antek










'kay
i'm going to draw a cat

ye yes yeah
it's not very uh

very good drawn but you can see a cat from it


it's

ah it's not scared he's crying but

uh it's i most cats are small you can handle them

uh to go with to go with fashion and

team leader
no
oh


hello

dang it

do you know how how i can wake it up
oh
come on move it
now wake up bitch
yeah so did i i closed it that wasn that wasn't very smart i guess come on get back to me
yes
i closed it
no i didn't restart it i just closed it

i mean a bird
hmm it's a handicapped cat



he's crying because it's ugl because of his ugliness


i wouldn't call it training but
alright
i don't th i don't think the four of us got problems with remote controls but if you see
elderly people all these buttons and then they buy new t v  because their previous one was stolen or
whatever and then a totally different remote control with with different functions on different places and
half of the functions a are removed or whatever uh so i think what we need is is
a clear uh remote control with
uh grouped buttons you know all th all the buttons which apply to the text functions in in one uh
well one area or whatever not like the button to enter text on top of the remote control and the button
to um yeah to minimise it to this this or whatever
o o other functions totally somewhere else i think we should group them and same for the for the volume
buttons and the the t
well i was i was thinking uh since a t v  is uh mostly used together with
a v c r  or d v d  player or recorder and not with a stereo i think
it should be good to include functions for v c r s and d v d  players recorders
yeah
i don't know hi fi set is uh not often used uh as i know of in combination with television
yes
yes it is only for television but uh
well
well we we're gonna brainstorm about that if we think it's useful we do it
that's right it's a television remote control but i was thinking since it is useful with d v d 
yep
yeah also no one's gonna buy it
i guess
yeah
yeah

yeah way too high
yep
well that's an idea of course yeah
mm hmm
yeah
yeah
yes what the market wishes
yeah

you just got a message
and it said uh five minutes so we got four and a half
no
he's the whatever
team leader
he is the whatever
yes
project joc project documents is for showing uh on the white board yeah
yes
alright
okay
yeah
no i don't think so yes great
yeah good luck
i will need it
mm hmm
marketing expert
mm
okay
yeah
no sure
uh it's david jordan course
mm hmm
no no
uh this one doesn't want to be moved i think
so i dunno it's maybe difficult to have both i mean the the one on the right doesn't look so simple and
yeah
yeah

yeah and then
yeah
oh it should okay yeah the user should know
yeah that's gonna be the trick

okay
so that's the point

mm

true
okay
what the cost is twelve twelve a half
that might just so
okay
what's the average price of this technology then
but this is what you would like to ask the user first and i don't think the user would be ready to have a
i don't think well yeah i don't think he would but in a sense
the wire
yeah
true
uh that's my job that's the
now the
yeah
well that's actually one of the point yeah true this you will see in my presentation then
yeah
which is participant four
so just trying to answer all the questions if the user would be happy to have something or something else uh
we've made a study so could you go to next slide sorry for the functional recurrence
so that's the standard method for marketing okay we had one hundred subjects um we observe
their remote control use in a lab and then after all the experiments they had to fill up
a questionnaire um
and see what was okay or not for them okay so then it's some statistics about what we observed and what they answered
um actually seventy five percent of the users find m the most remote controls uh ugly okay so that's
yeah the the look is is bad for them so uh it's your job david maybe
then eighty percent of users would spend more money um
actually if if the remote controls were not so ugly so this is where we could have uh
yeah good market i guess if people are ready to pay more
so it's it's interesting information i think and then um
yeah the remote controls like the one you've shown previously
it's not so doesn't fit the user requirements sometime because it's too many buttons and so on so we should change this as well and uh
users are actually zapping a lot so they're using the device intensively that's something to take into account as well and um you know ten percent of the buttons are actually used in the remote control
and uh this is one of the main point for me but i'll come back to it later
'kay
could you go next slide
uh so as you said uh remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room
so this is from the experiments we've done so if we could solve this problem this would be interesting for the user i think
um it takes too much time to learn how to use the remote control for thirty five percent of the people
and uh remote control are really bad for r s i  problems for twenty six percent of the users
r s i  is like when you're using the same um doing the same movement several times
then you get injured okay so those numbers are less important then the previous one
but still it has to be taken to count so last slide
um so my pres personal preferences for this problem is we have to meet the user needs
if we can make it look fancy then we might sell more than our uh concurrent
okay and definitely if it could have less buttons still maybe the same number of um
functions but less buttons this would definitely be a good way of selling more okay
so
yeah remember the user is not happy to read the
manual it's

yeah
yeah this is something we sh
but this was first step and
this was the first step yeah
specially distribution yeah
uh
yeah but this is what we would ask to the users so
yeah
yeah remember it's twelve euros
hmm
yeah it's done just yeah if we would if we could remember like not too many buttons and make it look fancy i think it would make it
so
lame or
mm hmm
yeah
mm hmm
so has to be yellow
i don't think it's part of the remote control design anyway it's maybe more in browsing
yeah
hm mm
mm hmm
min
yeah
regarding the first line what
so we're just expecting no more use of the teletext
and that's it
it's already changed for
mm hmm
industrial designer
yep
okay
yeah
industrial design
one one
three three it's three sorry
in one sorry
so you didn't save it maybe
alright so
david jordan mm hmm
too great for email then
yeah

to merge the two system huh

mm yep
but but this is
yeah
yeah you maybe you have some international standards where you know if you can use one is the other are or almost the same so the sign
yeah yeah for example i dunno here escape you know you have escape in computers you have so
if you see escape you know that it should be the same so you have to the sh the user there for
example the power off button it is something very international you know that
so
yeah so
yeah but the question is how to merge you know the google system to the system alright
that's your job
it you
okay okay
participant two
yeah

the rationale must be design or
so we can move to the next slide as you all know you know m my job is to design you know uh
to give an industrial design of the remote control so the re basically the remote control will be you know infrared control so the problem is how to relate the
how to relate the remote control device like for example this one i h i'm holding in my hand and the t v  so this one is leather bu based but
i propose a nifra infrared base you know so so for me
i think that it is better it's bet it's better to control t v  so
you know so it's it will be cheaper and it is less technology than you know
for the cheap price we have for the cheap price we want to
i think it's cheaper than laser so
yeah i think for the cost we want for the cost we want it's better to have uh uh
let's see yeah you can move to the next slide so so the di the differen the findings you know what you find inside
the re i the the system here inside it is just you know a bulb and an infrared bulb
so here for example the infrared bulb will be here and the bulb it will be somewhere
inside
you can go to the next slide i have some kind of pictures
you know here
you have the b the bulb it is a blue the blue stuff here and the infrared and the infrared bulb it is the red stuff you know and so and you have the other subcomponent that are not really here so important so
this is in fact some other component that are in between the electrical de the electronic device
look
but here what i wanted to emphasise it is just you know the bulb and
so and the next slide it is the last one it's so it's
i think it should be wire wireless re remote con
because you know it's easier to manage and you know
because you f the b the the battery problem can hold you know will you use a battery or the a wire to connected you
or maybe some kind of thing that we can have both but you know i at my side prefer a wireless
okay so if you have some question i didn't answer
well the avera the average prices i think that this technology will cost i dunno around eight euros so or at least you know the
you'd yes you can it's so so bres you have to decide how how you will you know put
some energy inside so you can think about wireless or you know it's it's a question that we can
raise so we can think that you know with the wire you know without a wire we can have both also


yeah but some pa
i always want to have you know sometime i want to have wire because you know


uh i don't think it will be too much


have to think about the question you know 'cause it's i think that you know you can always you know
i think wha wha with the wire it's mm cheaper but you know the wireless it's more practical so
okay yeah
yeah but it should be an agreement you know because even if you can think of the wireless it is it's it is the job of the the the g graphical user designer but you know
if it is a lot cheaper and if you want to reach for example some
the the money you have if you want to use so it can be good to have a wireless it it is a question right so

okay
mm hmm
the look how it look like
yeah
yeah
okay
okay
the manuals
with a
look fancy
this is a question that should be asked to the
if you ask the people maybe the the marketing people
i think the solution is to have many colours of you know instead of having one grey standard
yeah yeah maybe yeah maybe
yeah yeah yeah
yeah
yeah hmm
yep
so
yellow
for cheap remote control yeah
yeah
yeah 'cause what i'm thinking is how will you will connect the t v  to internet so
this is
yeah but this this mean that your t v  would be able to you know connect to internet you know surf the web
okay
it's pop i don't think it's popular so that's the problem so you had i if you are designing a remote control for you know
the global usage so if people don't have the technology
yellow do you think that people like the colour yellow
i think if you have you know th like a yellow ribbon here is the double r  or should be yeah so doesn't need to be completely yellow but just mm
but i dunno but why nobody's a threat to me
industrial designer yeah
component component yeah
good
okay okay that's clear
so i will open our functional design meeting
so i will play role of the secretary
as also program ma manager so we will have the three presentations from the
in industrial designer user interface designer and um
what's your talk marketing experts
and after that we uh will have the
uh
new product requirements
the decision on the remote control functions
and we will
close the meetings after
mm so
um i suppose the first to do the presentation will be the user interface designer
um so you're participant two
no you're
no i'm participant one
okay never mind
'kay did you save your presentation
isn't that technical functions
name's jordan
so
so i'll
i let david jordan do his presentation
uh
mm

so you propose to to have the
remote control which will be powerful
so powerful
many functions and very easy to use
you mean this one yeah you have to learn the manual before using this remote control i suppose
oh you mean for the yeah pic pictograms or things like that
yeah um such as maybe the
go on go back and
so you will propose us something which is
yeah so powerful and easy to use okay
so next i propose the industrial user interface to present things
so you you're
um okay
so baba is the uh the industrial
designer
okay
mm hmm

so you mean that infrared control is a cheap technology
yeah do y you know the requirements for the remote control
twelve nearly thirteen yeah the cost
mm hmm
okay
yeah
what is this
okay
okay
okay
so you think that uh
a cable between the remote control and the t v  won't
be a good idea no it wou maybe it will be cheaper i dunno
i just may maybe you making a solu
yeah but

yeah but as industrial designer do you think that it will be feasible to have uh linked or to have link between the remote control and the television i'm just asking you do you think it will be cheaper
could you answer please
okay
yeah but i think the wireless problem is more the um david jordan's problem as it's yeah
i think it's more your problem mayb maybe you have just to to kind of research or try to ask people if they will like something wireless or not
okay i'm sorry so
so just think of um the usability yeah just think of the problem if when you have wireless remote control and if you lose it
i think it's would be easier to have a link between the remote control and the television yeah
so i will let you to do your presentation so

you mean the loo the look the outside okay
mm hmm




what is r s i 
ah um okay
mm hmm
mm okay
and just to have uh an idea do you think you as the
user interface designer to would it be possible to have less buttons and still have the same functionality and to have powerful remote control you think it's possible sure yeah
yeah
yeah but do you think it will be easy to use because if you have many functions just for one button it would be quite difficult for the user to know
yeah i think the
yeah but it has to be intuitive
yeah okay
okay but
yeah but
mm hmm
yeah but i think it will increase the price of the production of the remote control
if you need to have special colours for remote controls it will cost more
yeah it will cost little bit more
and also f
yeah but as soon as you speak about options it means that the price increases and we don't really want the price to be too too high because we wanna be able to produce it
so we want something fancy as uh previously said florent something very
easy to use powerful and also as uh it's written here seventy five percent
of users they zap lot so maybe just having many functions in one button is not
that good if you want to zap a lot
and they don't really want to zap between functions of their remote control they want to zap between channels on t v 
so
i think you have quite lot of points to to think about and to discuss it with uh the other members
so is it okay for your presentation nothing else to to add
mm hmm okay
mm so
so i had some
new information about the product requirements so you will have to
take care of it of it in your thinking in your designing of the remote control so the first one is that um for the designing of the remote control we don't really want to use the teletext anymore as it's something that's
it's is uh
no yeah because now everybody has internet at home so it's better to use internet then teletext
so you will have to think about it in your in in the design of your remote control and also the remote control will only be used for television so
for y for you your designing you're not you won't be uh
you won't had um buttons to just to manipulate yeah to control
the recorder or maybe the garage door or things like that it's
because if we want to
to do remote control
which will be used for for the television for the recorder for the camcorder and all the others it will become too complex and it will increase the pli the price and we can't do that we really want to focus on the remote control for the television is it okay
so maybe it will be easier for you to to design it to have very powerful and
easy and also we want the image of the uh um
real reaction be recognisable in the product such as the colour and s the slogan
i mean that's uh if uh you want to buy a remote control and if you go in a shop
and if you see the remote control you will recognise directly that s it's our product
so you will have to use the colour of the product of the um um
of the uh of real reaction
and uh also
yeah as we say we put the fashion in electronics so it has to be a fashion remote control fancy fashion powerful easy to use
require lot of requirements but
yeah
yeah
but uh that's your your job to find something mm matches

maybe not but mayb
so
so everybody is okay with the new requirements
i think it has to be yellow
yeah
maybe you can change the colour but the image of the society has to be recognised
why you go
it has to be fashion
so you have to
yeah it has to be a fashion and really be uh the image of the society
just when you enter you say oh oh it's real reaction think it's a re reaction remote control
so and also it has to be attractive of course because if you want to sale to sell the remote
control
it's okay
yeah
yeah
i think it would be simpler
okay
so
i will close the meeting um just after that we'll have lunch break
and you will have in thirty minutes individual work
uh
y you
you will have as the i d  i don't remember what is industr industrial designer to put um pon yeah and the user interface designer to work on the user interface concept
and florent to
work my subject and so specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach
it's okay i think the um session is closed
and by the way mister david jordan please record your presentations in your own folder not in mine should be better
okay
okay
no no no
one
i i think i'm a
in one
it's mine
mm yeah
okay
okay so
the first i will present the technical function design for user interface for our uh remote t v  control
uh i i will focus on user interface design um so move to the next slide as we know our
remote c rem remote t v  control it's very has very soph sophisticated functions as we show from this picture
there's a lot of functions
over i think over
s twelve or twenty s functions of a remote t v  control
so how can we
um design a user interface with so sa with so many sophisticated functions
um let's move to next slide
um
yeah
so i so we want to design uh elegant easy to use inter interface
a very good example is google as we know uh google it's a very successful because his um powerful function but with very easy to use user interface
um so move to next s slide
so my job is to uh design a google t v  controller
which i want to have sophisticated functions while with very easy to use user interface
so
that's the end of the talk the end of the presentation
uh
with sophisticated functions but with very yeah powerful
yes
yep
yeah
but if we have very very good user interface
it take less time for user to learn how to use it
yeah that's my job
that's my job it's not the easiest i've got to
yep
powerful and easy to use
yeah that's the point
so what the wireless remote control there's a wire with remote control
okay

okay
okay

wireless remote control

okay
mm hmm
mm hmm
okay
design a wireless remote control
yeah
functions
yeah
yeah i think possible because we can
we can uh
mix uh several function in one button
so lets you then you have less buttons but i'm not sure
no you you can have a switch menu so you can
well for example
yeah i think so like for for example you can uh you can category the function i i into several classes then
for um you can have a switch menu so you put the switch menu
to it it tend to this kind of this category of functions then you you put
the switch button then it
switch to another category of functions
yeah
for example if you have remote control you you can rem you can control your t v  and also you can control your uh recorder
so there's a different functions but i if you you there's a button you can switch between control t v  and control your recorder
so we can has less buttons but what i'm not so sure is about how to make the remote control look funny look fancy not funny because different people have a different opinion about fancy you know

because maybe a colourful is fancy for some people but maybe simple and uh uniform colourful is fancy for some for other peoples so
yeah personalised colour because you know
yeah because maybe some people prefer a red remote control some people prefer black remote control
maybe we can have di di we can have uh several options so user can select which colour they prefer so
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah
control
mm hmm

mm
okay but there's balance between function and the cost
yeah okay
mm hmm
mm hm
okay
okay
okay
mm hmm
yeah
and cheap a low cost
yeah there's that box in uh o of it a pi there's that box in the t v  so with the set box you you can connect internet with your t v 
ok
it's it's not so uh popular now
mm
global okay
so i i so
as as for the colour what what do you think
yellow t v  remote control
okay
okay
okay
okay okay
okay
mm
okay
okay okay

yeah still doesn't feel natural i i wish you know the the the the room would just detect when an when a meeting's started it starting

voila cool so you better start it was your idea so
well maybe uh is is the white board working
or or not um y maybe show us the general sort of outline you keep w okay you can just write it on the paper yeah
so is this different from the original p l p  two stuff then is that
uh 'cause that's what you started with wasn't it this this stuff that marius
okay
okay
yeah yeah h he's parameterizing it both temporally and across the spectrum yep
yeah
yeah
yep okay yep
yeah to that yep yep yep
mm yeah but it's a it's a it's a different linear prediction model isn't it it's a complex linear prediction or whatever
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah yep
okay
okay
you need the phase ooh uh
well
well it depends on how this i i mean you're talking b yeah just the carrier okay so it's not necessarily phase but if you're using some sort of sinusoidal coding it's phase yeah
okay
okay w
what so what sort of bit rate do you get for the um encoding of the this the hilbert transform the s the spectrogram w what sort of coding do you get so far for the no no no no f f yeah yeah yeah yep
uh wo well it's no no no but what sort of bit rate do you get is it is it uh id do you have any sort of m idea of what sort of band widths
yeah
'cause
okay and that's in that's with the fully optimised sort of compression scheme or that's just the raw data or
okay yeah
yeah sure sure you just cut out m bands and just use interpolation or whatever yeah t so that's one point okay that's with the full spectrum basically being used then
yeah yep yep yep
yep
yeah yep
okay that's quite good so and hynek was showing me how scalable it is in terms of um
you can take half the bands away and still get decent performance you take you take three quarters of them away
it starts to degrade but it's still intelligible that sort of thing yep okay and that's without doing any
sort of um prediction of what the missing bands might be right you just leave them out i mean you
you shou you could be able to do some sort of code missing data sort of bayes stuff yeah
okay
okay
yeah
it it would be it would be nice to have a scalable scheme though wouldn't it like because you've got a nice scalable
scheme for the for for the the coding of the the smooth spectrum it'd be nice to have some sort of scalable
coding scheme for the for the voice signal as well right

well i don't know i'm just
well at different bit rates so the actual uh excitation as well because i mean it'd be nice uh l let's say if you had twelve hundred bits for the for the sp smooth spectrum and twelve hundred bits for the voice and then you could scale them both
yeah sure sure sure
yeah
uh
no no just long as it's some sort of non linear yep
m
the place more emphasis on the
yeah yeah yeah
okay
yeah
okay
hmm
and then vector quantize or whatever yeah
hmm
hmm
mm hmm
so times fifteen twen that's t it's twenty times fifteen it's not
okay so it's it's yeah it's three hundred
it i mean it's it's total of three hundred sort of parameters per second um
well y you're not you're not carrying transmitting that at all really at this point in time i uh
and and you get whispering type synthesis yeah
yep or one of these glottal pulse things f and just use basic l p c  ten style
yeah which is which is probably i mean if you're going to aim for like a very low rate code to below five hundred bits per second
i guess that's that's probably fine but
uh the lowest standard is melp i think which is twenty four hundred the standard
it's been implemented at twelve hundred f bits per second using more more complicated quantization schemes and stuff like
that i think i think so yeah i s i saw that they used matrix quantisation on the l p  uh on
the l s f  parameters or whatever but i mean that's quite it becomes quite computationally intensive
but i mean i imagine the same sort of approach could be taken with yours as well
no
yeah that's the same twenty melp 's a lot better quality though yeah
 no no i think i think
i think i think celp or celp or however you pronounce that it's about forty eight hundred i think
yeah well the standard's forty eight hundred or something yeah yeah
or based around that yeah okay it's not terribly interesting though really
yeah so i'm
well you you've well i mean you've got a bunch of options haven't you you can use like uh a codec sided or you could use a
sinusoidal based no yeah yeah sure sure sure
yeah but what's more interesting i i mean 'cause c i i i suspect there somethings like um celp you're gonna get h lot higher band width aren't you i mean it's a high band width standard so yeah
okay
yeah yeah yeah
okay
hmm
okay so i mean
how
yep
yeah 'cause it's a bit tricky isn't it that's it's not like a standard i'm just thinking i mean what sort of opt it's not like you can't just do standard um you know inverse filtering for um signal reconstruction or anything like that can you

uh oh okay and then you just then you just do the inverse f f t  or whatever
okay the oth i mean the other o
mm yeah
but that's gonna be susceptible to having phase problems is that when you

yeah yeah
yeah okay
yeah
hmm and now i mean there is there are um mm there is research uh um
pu that's been published showing you know speech reconstruction from the essentially the spectrogram without
phase information yeah so
yes
yes but i mean you can reconstruct the the f the th the entire
spectrogram from that can't you so you could do it that way cause i'm just saying there's a heaps of there heaps of options like if y you be exactly the same as sinusoidal coding or something like that all you need is the reconstruction of the spectrogram in order to estimate the harmonic amplitudes and
yeah
yeah
ye
just by refitting
yeah
yeah yeah
okay
yeah okay
d it's th
yeah but that's that's the big thing at the moment isn't it if if you're mm if i if the if the exci if the if
the encoding rate's two kilo bits per second for the the excitation component of the signal
it doesn't matter how efficient your um encoding of the spectrogram is you're always gonna have a high
relatively high bit rate
yeah
nah
yeah yeah yeah sure well one could argue it's it's a field that's quite a sort of a niche these days isn't it um
in standards and yeah
mm yeah
well did you say uh who said
yeah is it nokia's being sued in the u s  for their tri band
usage 'cause you know intellectual property uh no no g g s m 
because they don't have g s m  in the u s  or i didn't have g s m  in the u s 
uh it's f uh okay
no no n
uh well that's tri band s yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yep and apparently nokia's in a bit of trouble over that one but yeah well it's interesting

yeah should've been a lawyer
well that's
but i mean coding is a much more sort of it's it's it well i mean it's it's uh it when
it boils down to just mathematics to a large extent doesn't it it's it's just uh sort of
it's you know communications s sort of no
yeah sure sure
yeah sure sure push to talk and stuff like that yep
and i mean as you say i mean that delay is i mean you can squash that delay to some extent right
i n i think as far as the co you know c c delilah's coding goes i don't think you can probably do
much more than what's already been achieved because to get higher compression you have to
you know take advantage of redundancy over longer time spans so

yeah sure but i mean that's transmission delay not algorithmic delay if you add those together you end up with a the nightmare scenario
i guess we might have someone else joining our uh meeting soon
oh yeah i don't know i mean uh you'd be you tried sinusoidal coding based approaches didn't you sinusoidal
coding
yeah but sure yeah m yeah tr yeah it's a yeah but i mean the th the the thing is you'd need ti it
part of the parameter set for that is uh the um uh the f uh the harmonic
amplitudes and then one way of compressing the harmonic amplitudes is just storing the smooth spectrum
and then you can uh and then you can interpolate yeah you can just pick the the um the harmonic amplitudes on that
spectrum when you reconstruct on that smooth version of the spectrum when you reconstruct y yeah well
i was just saying
yeah yep
yeah well i i th it's high it's quite a high bit rate but i mean once we it maybe it's something that's scalable
well it i mean you can use as many harmonics as you want i m h uh he was just using the fundamental frequency and if you smooth
it doing a smooth spectrum representation of the harmonic amplitudes then you only need to store the
the the fundamental frequency and and the and the maximum voice frequency and everything else can be
yeah s yeah sure so and then but then the tricky the only tricky thing that we hadn't figured out was the phase information
um but y but uh you can still get a like you get th um basically if you do phase unwrapping and all of these
other tricks you end up with some sort of phase representation which is some sort of monotonically decreasing
function yeah unwrapped yeah so i mean it's something that you could conceivably
represent in some sort of low sort of r you know low bit rate representation
i guess and then maybe you'd need some sort of correction to um to correct minor phase discontinuities
at some point in time
'cau

yeah yeah sure
yeah okay
okay
yeah
yeah
okay
yeah sure sure
yeah yep

yeah yeah
hmm
no and you uh you wanna avoid hard choices on voicing decision yeah
well that's one of the big problems with l p c  ten for instance i it stinks because this hard yeah


yeah sure
yeah
yeah yep
but but that that two hundred this is what they use for like um st they they do use this for um for
um pitch marking in speech so this is what alan black's code uses but it's very speaker dependent
wh on what sort of band width you'd look at this hilbert envelope depending on the pitch
depending on the person y you'll get a different amount of smoothing and a certain sort of
so i mean you know if it's a female speaker for instance you yeah so it's sorta tricky
yeah
uh n no y yeah but from memory that
that basic script that they had wasn't wasn't very um effective i mean maybe if you did some sort of
initial first p guess and then and then chose your smoothing factor based on that 'cause it it you know
selecting at any particular point of what the what the pitch is at the may be inaccurate but if you estimated
it over a second you should be able to get a decent estimate i'd i'd think
yeah well it'd be nice to it would be nice to really see what this what you're a actually trying to reconstruct here
this carrier signal what what it really looks l yeah and you did say it looks like a frequency modulated cosine
hmm
yeah
it would have to be 'cause pitch shifts yeah
yeah
yeah
hmm
hmm
mm
yeah
mm hmm
hmm
yeah it's like a yeah and it it does start to get a little bit n non linear towards the end but normally that's that's when the components are not actually probably gonna be audible anyway in voiced speech right so yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah sure c
c 'cause any sort of error in that in that line is is transmitted is realised in a net as a phase error right yeah

mm
okay
mm yeah
tricky yeah

yeah yeah yeah y y y you have s five slices like n across that way i guess
yeah
hmm
yeah that makes sense 'cause it's a time domain sort of approach um and i mean uh and
and in in fact i mean it's what you're doing is so different to most approaches to speech coding that
it doesn't matter that we don't know much about or haven't had much i it's i mean it's quite different to a lot of the traditional
sort uh so uh voi um you know source filter type approaches or or whatever
yeah so
it's just a matter of minimum distortion time yeah

sure
unvoiced unvoiced speech is very difficult to b sort of judge on quality compared to voiced i think
plosives yeah plosives are very important though i guess so maybe it does a better job of plosives
okay it'd be nice if we had some demos here well i suppose have to wait to your i guess
oh it's a little wa oh bugger i won't be yeah no you'll practice it before then won't you
yeah he's going to oz yep

i did yeah but we're d we're doing a more traditional s s frequency slices rather than temporal based stuff
yeah well that's w that was one of the approaches sure yep and the other approach was was this h m m  based stuff
which is which is basically just a parameterization of the you know the the the the um the source
filter type parameters and then and then learning the you know training like a h speech recognition system
but that's not terribly that's got no relationship to this i it's yeah
yeah sure speech coding i i read some of the other techniques um little standards but
um i mean i think i think you're on the right track with the analysis by synthesis but that
doesn't tell you how what sort of bit rates you're going to achieve or um and because you have to do
it separately for each um band it would be the i
imagine that's the tricky part
um because it would be varying quite rapidly wouldn't it your um your uh code book
like w within each um when you go along the the the b the one second
sort of segment of the band you
yeah yeah
yeah well i mean yeah first you've gotta choose your approach and not worry about the band width and then start thinking
about how to given 'cause i mean i guess especially 'cause this is a this is a more of a commercial based
project you've g c you've you've gotta i match the quality before you start worrying about other things right
i mean d d do they i mean what what what sort of uh

uh huh okay well that makes things uh
with
they're happy okay cool
yeah sure sure and at the moment you're at sort of a point where maybe you have to make that choice a little bit yeah mm hmm

yeah uh which is not
yeah
yeah al although the standards depending on what standard you're dealing with sometimes it can be quite ambiguous
right i mean all the m  peg standards are basically this is the container we don't care how you do it right but it's gotta fit inside
this this sort of this sort of format
okay and then you have the v and then you have to do m o s  um testing and
okay

well ho it
okay
mm
yeah yeah well i th
no no no


uh no no no yep
well the the what's what's new is in the transmission medium like you know new like higher band width
transmission or uh or like packet packetized based transmission and then all th
that sort of thing the where th where they're they're not so much looking at the algorithm but so much as how to
incorporate the algorithm within a new transi mission sort of s medium basically s like i mean if you d if you see a lot of
papers on like um on uh voice over i p  or whatever the the publications are sort of like um
how do we deal with packet loss or or how was it affected by packet loss and and and things like that
yeah sure
yeah
and optimization of the code and all that sorta stuff yeah but even that's less of a big deal now right because all the little um i  s yeah
not really you could trow matlab on a mobile phone these days well maybe not but
yeah
y yeah
yeah which david did yeah
it's good yeah
yeah we've got all his code implemented so uh it wasn't perfect there was little bit of bugs with some of the matching but
it was pretty hard to tell that it was m not not perfect unless you heard the samples
sort of next to one another so that's not too bad
oh sure and i mean it
well th
the only trick is the phase and we've got a student starting in january who's gonna start working on on how to
actually efficiently parameterize the um the h m m  yeah yeah
and i think i think we've got a number of ideas for the the spectrum that's easily enough handled just using standard techniques but
the
without phase i've got no idea uh you reviewed a paper on a
uh steven cox isn't it yeah
university of east anglia it's near c sort of it's it's near the sorta cambridge side of england i guess

no the much more mathematical i think yeah just basically doing a search through or or stuff stuff like that don't they or
yeah
yeah
no
yeah yeah sure where you've only got the m f c c s but th i think i think the i think it was to was it to do with aurora or something the okay i was
okay
yeah but it w it was for say um say you've got someone who has you know they wanna dispute
that this is what they actually said by the recognition and the recognition network was wrong and you owe me
money or whatever um and then they can say well we've we've reconstructed your speech from the speech recogni
input to the speech recognizer hey voila it sounds like you uh uh i mean obviously there's a lot
more to it than that there's a lot of sort of well does the quality stand up to legal sort of requirements or whatever but
um
oh no that there's a separate set of standards i think for speech recognition y yeah yeah yeah
yep which uh i think requires you know that states the un the information they can send is
this so i don't know whether you tack on any extra phase information or whatever you have to deal with what you're given
so
yeah i don't know i i it would be interesting you i mean maybe that's the best approach to look at to begin with is just pretend all you have got is
yeah
um because you can also interpolate the pitch information from the the spectrum as well
they do that
yeah so i mean maybe try to see how good you can go without transmitting any of that information
the pitch was really good i thought i th didn't think you could really tell
yeah
yeah
yeah but but the thing is if it's mel scaled if you have a mel scale you get quite fine reconstruction of the spectrum at the lower frequencies it which is what you need for reconstruction of the pitch anyway
so i mean if you wanted to transmit with fewer bands you'd maybe still keep the lower bands or or maybe you could still transmit
the pitch the pitch isn't that big a deal but it'd be nice if you didn't because then i mean that's well i mean it's worth giving it a go and then men
maybe seeing wh what information you can add to the data stream to improve performance
um
i don't know
that that'd be cool so get coding

mm i think w
ah well i mean huffman's easy enough but but yeah sure uh that that's where i stop run length encoding i'm out of here

okay
i mean i i th i think they do try to i mean obviously the the the techniques they they
choose are supposed to be less you know susceptible to coding errors let's say you know i but i mean
that's maybe the the limit to that
yeah
okay
okay

yeah at least on paper yeah yeah at least you can write on the p
yeah celp
yeah
hmm
no but marius is it's similar stuff no marius is also using like hilbert transform and then
both
yeah
uh is some kind of d c t  or again yeah yeah ok
yeah
yeah yeah yeah
how c
mm hmm
yeah
because use linear phase or
yeah uh oh okay
yeah
yeah
same frequency
yeah
for l s f 
main bit rate what is
good
oh
ah okay
hmm
hmm
s
yeah
hmm
hmm

yeah yeah
hmm
oh yeah type
hmm
s
hmm
s so
oh okay
smoothed or like apply more
hmm
ah
hmm
so after you're doing l s f s so or like i mean how you're finally hand coding
ah
oh
yeah so first you apply these triangle filters and then do l p c  coding or like
yeah
yeah okay yeah
filters yeah
oh okay
hmm
you can do the l p  analysis on each sub band yeah yeah m yeah ok
yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah
so how many l s f s you're using and
oh okay so but you how many bands you're using if you're you're not skipping any bands or like oh ok fifteen into twenty then like uh
hmm
ah

oh yeah
but phase you're not encoding anything phase you're directly transmitting that uh no th yeah yeah yeah the phase of hilbert envelope
you're not transmitting at all like
yeah yeah is noise fourier
yeah
yeah
so what is the celp standard now like it's it's two kilo bits per second or the
oh that two two kilo bits per t
ah ok
ah some
yeah yeah but
yeah
hmm
yeah but this is codec centred no you have code book so
oh it's not codecs code book there is not code book oh ok
oh
yeah celp is
yeah it's it's it's around one kilo byte like yeah yeah that's a i think even g s m  and all this g  seven two nine yeah yeah on based on celp at least it gives
but still they use a code book no so that's really uh it's maybe better than like using just random noise or
yeah yeah
yeah
yeah
huh
yeah
ah okay
hmm
but
hmm
inverse yeah inverse hilbert yeah yeah
or output signal like
yeah
and then yeah
yeah yeah
hmm
oh ok
hmm
hmm

hmm
hmm but yeah but it's more towards industry no like the yeah because i worked in a industry for like a small time but they're they used to implement all these coders g s m  and i t u  standards
no just before my p h d  for like few months yeah but that's uh like industry it's
really a big deal like so they they they work on a lot of these standards yeah
but mostly they're all based on celp like mainly yeah so
how
tri band is g s m 
c d m a 
no no but c d m  is there but now slowly they're introducing g s m  also now in u s  like yeah g s m  tri band like the frequencies are different like very uh
ah
yeah now it's really big competition
yeah
standard maybe like established
yeah
so where do you think your thing is useful in c d m a  or g s m  i think maybe in c d m a  it may be m c d m a  is more like
more time domain the they they are c doing only
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
but you know really the these long line telephones they already have delay no at least half a second or
yeah yeah yeah yeah but mobile m
and this one is
uh harmonics and the
yeah
and then picking yeah
yeah
but maybe the bit rate is the problem no like what david was doing like it's really uh yeah yeah yeah
yeah maybe you can just see how many how many harmonics he was using twenty i think like yeah maybe you can try to reduce
yeah
yeah
and the f
and then all this amplitude
ah yeah yeah yeah
yeah each again
some kind of linear yeah
yeah yeah
some function or like a
hmm yeah yeah
oh
yeah
the size of the
but you don't do any voice un voice decision no yeah the that's even advantage i think for this approach yeah yeah
yeah sorta the modelling it's really another issue like yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah and then you have to combine all this harmonic model
and noise model so again you may end up some
'cause
oh okay
the pe peak uh
yeah yeah yeah
yeah
s
yeah yeah
so that's a you have to tune lot of parameters like i am
but anyway you don't really need hard decisions no like voiced unvoiced
so m maybe it may help you but it yeah yeah
yeah yeah
yeah
but do you really really need it or like voiced unvoiced yeah but yeah yeah but it's not really you need t you don't need to specify at each point it's voiced or yeah
huh
yeah and then amplitude but you're telling even frequency's also shifting
no like your delay yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so then yeah then it's not exactly amplitude
modulations or it's it's in between maybe yeah s yeah
so yeah
yeah
that's what marius did no like but but he was keeping all the phase information
no but even the his coded like he just he he didn't do anything he just transferred it that way he was aiming
for he's not really kind of doing speech coding but he want to do it on music so he doesn't
really care about the band widths or he want to have the quality no like yeah but even especially
the audio series and the that that's what he was telling like yeah at least even ten k  bit twenty kilo bits also
is okay so but he's uh he's not i think finished with all that thing he's just transmitting all the phase
and then but he's encoding the envelope yeah yeah
yeah yeah
and then leaving the phase yeah
yeah
yeah
hmm
yeah yeah
yeah
yeah or
auto correlation coefficient and
yeah they again give the phase yeah again give the phase
yeah
oh
hmm
but this phase is different from your carrier no like yeah because you're just doing on uh your uh yeah and also like yeah and
yeah
hmm
but even you can use as a can you use that phase directly whereas the d yeah this one is direct
but this is phase of your d uh spectrum no like it's not in time domain so
of your signal it's not so then it's bit tricky like how

okay but still you get only the the magnitude of your hilbert envelope you won't get the
no but you started with hil hilbert envelope no like magnitude of hilbert envelope
magnitude of uh no before d c t  your d oh
yeah
ah ok so input to the d c t  is the speech or like your yeah okay just you're starting with
ah ah ok ok ok
yeah maybe the then
yeah
ah okay
yeah it's in frequency domain no
yeah definitely it's d
but now i think people
yeah
yeah

so when is your turn uh
oh oh okay i mean just before oh you



low bit rate
yes
yeah

hmm
hmm
hmm

oh okay yeah
yeah
yeah yeah yeah you know the the
yeah
hmm
yeah
uh no no no yeah
yeah but it's mostly like this is uh s celp and these thing
no i was t uh doing some uh like writing some code for testing and these things where i'm making some
t standards for that so so th th there are like li the thing these standards how it works
is like they give all the pseudo code kind of thing and then they put severe test conditions so you
have to pass those test conditions like then j you can say okay we implemented d  seventy eight or
d  se
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah so that's why it's really even the t standards they give the test signals
also you are t you can't really do it on whatever database you have so so you are to use the uh uh
yeah uh it yeah it's more like uh they define so i did for some even
also they're also they define all this the speech condition everything they define so you need
to follow all those yes this industry is again different like yeah
yeah i think there isn't only se most yeah
ah celp is from uh a t  and t  no like a t  and yeah yeah it the all this l p c  stuff is
yeah
ah ok
ah okay yeah yeah
yeah the
yeah that's the main thing even yeah

yeah
yeah
yeah like i
voice over i p  or yeah uh yeah yeah
yeah
yeah and again lot of this stuff like whe even when i was working mostly that company was developing
for voice over i p  so they're to put all these things on again d s p s and also it's mostly like
how to how many l p c s are yeah how many co yeah it's optimation and then
it's even
yeah again now now now even they're also becoming yeah even the memories are not really yeah yeah yeah yeah
so even i think uh then you can have whatever band width is it's short really

but no i think uh but still then that's what maybe people are going toward sign sort of modelling no like i was before when the bandwidth conditions were really stringent then they were using all the p l p c  based source filter
yeah
yeah yeah if you want you can look at his code and but only th yeah yeah

yeah
yeah
but definitely it's better than co coded speech no different yeah it's really but uh how much you can get the compress these like what you're telling is you can do all these tricks like yeah these yeah
in yeah

well yeah i read uh i reviewed one paper like yeah the that's that's from no yeah maybe you
can look at dates from uh you know east of uh east uh yeah east anglia yeah
uh this uh e east university of east anglia ben milner
yeah i yeah it's yeah i can forward you that they're doing lot of tricks they're like they're
again training gaussian mixtures for different frequencies and then but they
can they're following the yeah yeah yeah
no no the those things are again based on l p c  no like mainly like yeah whereas like the pitch estimation in in the x  waves or these things they're all dynamic programming based on again l p c  analysis
yeah and then construct that
huh yeah again like uh no the problem is different for everybody like these guys what they're doing for distributor speech recognition mainly this uh so uh yeah m f c c s so
no it's e t s a  or something european standard yeah hynek really n yeah even it's h kind of aurora framework so yeah
no but now it's bit yeah now they're


and then yeah m f c  s

but even at distant point they're planning to use for j uh standard d s m  or d s  it's not or
yeah e  uh e t s a i  yeah european yeah commission so
m yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah i yeah all these standards are really okay
yeah but
yeah
but the quality again problem no like
no no the the eu again european standard what this give us they give the m f c c s and they give the pitch then you are to construct the thing but if have m f c c s then like again you have to get the high order m f c c s and then yeah then you're have to

yeah

yeah


yeah


hmm
mm
yeah

but i think again it's different no like these standards again all these g s m  standards maybe they have the compression standards
and again coding stand but maybe uh i i read ah yeah i don't remember
anything like yeah they're doing yeah combi yeah the even even g 
even normal g  seventy nine normal speech coder so they have the speech coding standards again they are these
channel coding so yeah so it's mm yeah b
maybe
yeah
yeah again yeah i
so okay
yep
th thank you then oh
you can write on the paper yeah it's it's okay
right
right right
mm hmm
hmm
okay
i have a question is the scale linear or is mel scale like in m f c c  is it bar scale like in like in sp yeah okay
the overlapping is different right yep mm
okay and
okay
uh uh
mm hmm
okay
mm hmm
i have never done anything
yeah tri band g s m  yeah different frequency yeah exactly mm hmm
okay
true
mm
mm hmm




i've never done any coding in my life so i just have one curiosity so
this is coding then s you code the speech then you're also supposed to transmit the speech right th let's say in
g s m  or something else i remember when i was doing some image processing there were techniques for compressing
and then coding so adding channel information on the image at the same time in order to save sound
bits
you see what i mean
exactly
i d was just wondering if there's some s someone was doing it with speech as well
well actually when you compress yeah all like first you compress the signal right and then you al you add
com some complexity to the signal in order to recover the error so i was wondering if by any chance there
was something like this in speech with the speech you don't know okay
well it's not the most difficult right

sure sure and and this was the problem actually because you were
no not not in g s m  definitely definitely not uh
okay
then th they some you know source so yeah
okay just one
yeah definitely
you
oh my god
yeah
okay
i should start yeah no so i thought that we might s t speak a little bit about speech coding because nobody is doing here speech coding
and i would like to have some maybe feedback because except me i've i've supposed to some
speech coding stuff here with hynek uh but you know that little bit at least that uh based on
some let's say hilbert transforms using a longer temporal context
and deriving some parameters would be tranf transcs transmitted to a decoder and
so it's a little bit different than the stuff which people are using now which is like a l p c  based
and but we are at the beginning with everything more or less so still um we can't uh
d encode a speech but of course there is there are many problems which we still didn't solve
and the biggest one is quite similar to l p c  stuff where people still don't know how to
exactly encode a carrier or the source signal we know what to do with the envelope
or how to approximate the envelope let's say um when you have got
oh you mean that it would be nice to plot at least s
um maybe i i can i can
so what we are doing now yeah you mean okay i uh everybody knows l p c  stuff how it works
so i don't have to present anything mores but it's uh m more or less very simple we have let's say at the beginning
there is some speech signal
what we are uh we might see it uh in very simple way that we are using some hilbert transform
h at the beginning to create analytic signal the analytic signal is the signal
which is a complex which you can create from the uh real uh uh some
sequence and if you get if you apply hilbert transform on this on such
a speech signal like a real trajectory then you get a complex signal and if you take just the amplitude
then you get hilbert envelope code so i well i i don't know yeah let's say ups
yeah it's u it's not p l p  at all d
mm
no he's it's pretty much the same
uh you're lit i know what you mean with the pu p l p  they are applying p l p  with
some iteration with this this one approach so they are doing some smoothing of a spectrogram
in two ways one was right right but p l p  is using just the spectral
uh direction let's say you are doing uh for every twenty millisecond processing one one feature vector
here you are processing one spectral band frequency band right so it's different direction which we are w using
but anyway this is very simple so applying that uh absolute uh absolute operation
you get a hilbert envelope
and of course then there is the phase so it's just the complex operation
and that's more or less all what we are doing so now what we know what we know is how to approximate that hilbert envelope
we are ap we are applying that hilbert uh him what is the marius' uh stuff so he knows
how to encode uh the hilbert uh envelope using
like l s f s or l p c  you are applying again to some linear prediction model after that
but it's uh right it's in a it's a little bit difference in not applied in the frequency domain
so instead of classical l p c  domain where you have a spectrum let's say something like that
and you are applying some linear prediction model which is trying to approximate the spectrum right
so this is frequency in our case we are we are trying to approximate s kind of instantaneous
energy so if this is a time and you get one and add one frequency
band you can see something like this and we are trying to approximate that envelope which is
that hilbert envelope right so again we know what to more or less we know what to do with the hilbert envelope
we know that we can apply linear prediction model and it works pretty well but i if
you want to really construct the speech signal or the you need also the phase signal which is in
uh some sense quite simple for voiced speech signal say but s
uh the phase no you ac it's a phase or you can encode it like a carrier so the carrier is
if you know uh amplitude modulation right you may see something like there is one cosine which
is uh very would have quite a f right
yeah
it's called like the phase right right exactly so the this is the signal which you also have to somehow encode or transmit from a code of the decoder in order to re synthesize it right so
what do you mean again
for this one for the the linear prediction model well it's uh just a linear prediction classical way i mean oh okay w well if you want to see it in more details i mean
oh you mean uh yeah bit bit rate you mean okay yeah sure sure so
whereas we are what we are now is let's say something like one point two kilo bits per second for
uh that hilbert envelope

is
it's again a roughly estimated somehow but we still know that we can go down and right
exactly yeah i don we are using like fifteen bands
right but they are first they are inter oh well integrated into fifteen bands using oh
classical way like in m f c c s or in p l p  you just apply some those uh triangular windows or
something like that in order to to get a li really like just fifteen bands right and each band is then
processed independently so for one band we more or less have w like w one hundred bits per
second for hilbert envelope
right right right you yeah you can just right right right yeah
uh right that's what we did
yeah sure sure sure yeah there are many things we would wouldn't at all but yeah exactly
but now what i r really trying to do is somehow approximate that uh carrier signal to do something with the carrier
there are many simple things which you can do like uh quantization quantization for example
right
you mean something like uh f uh that celp coding system where you're or wh wh wh what is no what is exactly scalable system what you mean by that
oh yeah yeah sure this was yeah
for dif yeah right right right
yeah but i think this appr approach can do that because you really can split it into several bands and you can decide how many bands you want more or less so

yeah this is a bar scale we are using yeah or mel mel scale so it's uh it's being uh
more wider for higher frequencies and of course the s the spaces right
yeah but what i w my sense is that it is not so much important still i mean
it doesn't matter if you're als use mel scale or bar scale but right yeah
but that's what we are using yeah uh actually we are using just gaussian windows here instead of those triangulars because
they are more uh no it's better than for decoding it's better to play
with them because they they are not zero anywhere you know they are they are approaching or in they are in zero
but actually they are not so d you don't have to care about some zero values here and but
more or less it doesn't matter yeah we are using just gaus gaussian windows
okay so l those are that the hilbert envelope is um is approximated by linear prediction
so you have l p c  coefficients which you can transcribe into l  l  l s f s which are
right exactly yeah
right exactly so first uh the approach is quite sim simple so at the beginning we apply
d c t  in order to get to frequency domain then you apply those uh triangular or gaussian
windows so this is done for one second eight thousand samples for eight kilo hertz sampling
frequency right so for such d c t  trajectory you apply those uh gaussian windows
and then i so you split it in two frequency sub bands and then each one f frequency sub band is more or less uh
right right exactly you just apply l  l p  so auto correlation let's say or you can do power spectrum whatever yeah so you for each one you get l s f s here
uh well i'm using now like twenty l s f s per one second per one frequency band
fifteen
no no if i just keep all them so twenty l s f s each one is um
is quantized by four or five bits
of what three hundred bits

two yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly
you mean this phase the the hilbert carrier or no of course we did
yeah
uh w well there are many things you can do we don't well the first thing what you can really do is just
to replace it by gaussian noise so you can really use t like in uh l p c  system right exactly
or you can replace it by some cosine one cosine generated in a cen centre frequency of
that gaussian window

right yeah
it mi it mi yeah
twelve hundred yeah yeah it's possible some of it
yeah
mm hmm
r right
well i'm just comparing with uh l p c  ten standard which is like classical l p c  a little bit optimized so there in the there is i think two point four kilo bits per second the bit rate for that
yeah definitely this is no uh i mean l p c  ten is just l p c  no no no no just noise or just those impulses
celp
yeah there yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah four point eight or something
right
yeah sure
well more or less what we didn't do is analysis by synthesis right so that's what celp is doing right
so yeah so this is what we do and uh that might help a lot of course but
w yeah exactly that's that's the question

it will be yeah yeah yeah sure for example uh there what i also did was uh a simple peak
peaking algorithm so if you take a look on that spectrum of that of that carrier signal which is more
or less like the cosine if you really take a look on that but it is kind of frequency shifted cosine or frequency
modulated cosine right so it's th the frequency still to be changing or of course the amplitude is just
not constant all time it should be theoretically but practically it's not so what you can see for a
one second signal you m more or less you already might see some like one
one uh impulse there or spectral line for but usually there are many others which are
s quite small but they are quite important if you don't transmit them then the signal is quite robotic or something like
that so if you're really transmitting just one spectral line but this is what you can do and you can understand pretty well the signal
is audible or if you're adjust uh th find one one
line one speaker and dom dom dominant one in the spectrum of that c uh carrier hil hilbert carrier
and you just transmit this parameter
no n
it's even easier because what you have to do is just divide the you just multiply that hilbert envelope by the table carrier that that's all
yeah yeah yeah exactly so so you just multiply that uh one hilbert carrier which is transcribed by l s f s by that this one i f f t  signal so
oh f you mean the phase of that uh of that carrier of
of course i try to play also with that and uh i found that it doesn't matter so much which what is the phase
because we are using just one second window right so of course there there might be uh some uh disturb
uh disturbed uh when you concatenate those segments together but  then the phase might
be important but otherwise i mean i didn't find any anything important with the phase
like great keep the phase zero and it works or
right right right right yeah but it's again a little bit different because they are i they are doing this in a frequency domain but this is in time domain more or less
right the spectrogram you mean yeah yeah yeah yeah
right right
exactly what we can also do very simple is just to get the magnitude spectrogram
using this approximation without the carrier just hilbert envelope but you just uh get it in in this way
in in the way of rob's right but you can also get the s short time fourier transform uh
and keep it right just classical uh frame by frame algorithm twenty milliseconds uh but you keep
just the phases instead of magnitudes and you can put this together right and it works
pretty well and then the signal is not uh just uh whispered then you really hear that
there is the voiceness in the signal but uh of course the quality is uh is not so good still
but uh you can use it for like two three kilo bits per second and it works
like yeah
right
right
yeah sure
anyway so um hmm m maybe it would be nice if you t if you tell us uh what you do with the speech coding 'cause
i d i didn't see any of p h d s of you i think so if you did something
so maybe it would be interesting at least to
yeah yeah sure
it's true
so you were when when did you do that
oh okay uh huh

i think so yeah
you mean using that uh c d m a  or
yeah it's not g s m  right it's uh kind of s no c d m a  is uh another level i think
mm hmm
i think there is a l lot of money in that like right like speech recognition of course it's very interesting but people don't use it so much as s just coding just telephoning right or just
right yeah they s yeah yeah
right right
no i i

well what we were what we were thinking about is oh c d m a  i mean there is the b
well the problem is this in with this application or it doesn't have to be problem but one constraint is that we are processing
one second of the signal you can go down of course but then you are losing little bit of the bit rate let's say right
so but there are many applications where you really can use it because you don't care about algorithmic delay one second algorithmic
delay like for i don't know if instead of s m s  you can really have some channel where
you just right um so probably
right right yeah
right
yep
right
what if s
which one s oh
well but the sinusoidal coding is usually m when you s at least what i think or uh what i know is
when you are doing sinusoidal coding it means you just take the speech signal at the beginning right and you are trying to find
to uh yeah to find the harmonics in a temporal domain right for that
right
oh yeah
right more or less i did it maybe different way but kind of algorithm like okay trying to find out the strongest or the the most dominant peaks in the spectrum which is more or less the same
but th
but you know the the f the interesting
right
right and that that's it
and then you do multiples of right yeah
yeah
like it
if it is unwrap you mean unwrap uh phase
right
you l right yeah
yeah yeah i also play with that and for example what i found i well in this case
uh we are not trying to encode the speech signal we are trying to encode some carrier which is much easier i
would say because you can really im you can see that even so what i was trying
to encode at the phases so i just found that uh two bits is enough for that and you really don't hear the difference so if
you keep all the spectral lines as they were there but you were just uh quantizing
with two bits or three bits for amplitude two bits for for phase so it's okay the problem is that you have to
transmit many of them 'cause there is not just one dominant component but usually more others which are quite small
right or what you have to do then you have to decrease the the the size of not one
second but you have to go down because then you can get just voiced part and unvoiced part you know one second it's usually
mixed right somehow together
not now no i wi
uh uh we don't no want to do that yeah because it's quite tricky
right
yeah sure exactly
right
but for example what we also found is that if you use just the hilbert envelope that that one which is trying to
approximate that energy in some low band like ar around two hundred t uh hertz
and you take a look on the signal on the trajectory you can see that it works like kind of um voice detector
because uh for a low energies there is usually noise for high energies there is kind of a harmonicity
so it works pretty well for that so we might use this one information for that but
yeah i think so yeah mm hmm
right uh huh
mm hmm
mm hmm
that's true yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah that's that's a problem
sure
uh f
that would be nice n not to have anything yeah
right
yeah yeah
my
mm hmm
right exactly
well i don't know maybe if you we uh really want to improve the the quality then we will need it i don't know still
n not now yeah uh well i'm gonna t have a time next next month or in three weeks so i'll try to play some examples there for you and
what we are trying to reconstr
how does it look like or sure
yeah more or less
it's kind of uh not frequency let's say amplitude modulation when you have ju just the carrier and that modulation signal right
yeah we yeah yeah yeah exactly
yeah yeah
it's in between exactly so it's not this and that but still yeah but anyway what also the
other approach which is possible to use the other is one to keep the phase like this one like two spectrograms
one the phase and one the magnitude and well i can again play it and it works on two kilo bits per second
quite what uh no what uh he was doing he was using it for speech recognition what
i what i know but for speech coding no no no it was i don't know
for speech coding you mean
i don't know i don't know m maybe
right yeah
mm hmm well for example this phase information right yeah yeah i think so
there are m more papers which are using this approach like trying to encode the magnitude spectrum or spectrogram
uh the phase or you just uh re can again the phase can be replaced by the noise which is pretty good so
that's uh the benefit uh variable approach so if you really don't have a band width you just can
replace it by noise and it works of course then it doesn't sound as the original because it's more whispered
or whatever but you can understand well
and for example uh if you mention this one approach with the that uh trajectory of the phase of unwrap phase recre
uh i also use because you can do it here when you get into uh this domain where you apply
uh or you're trying to compute uh s power spectrum in in order t let's say that this kind of trajectory
it doesn't in fit the same frequency over time domain but here you are trying to compute uh doing a to do
linear prediction so we are just doing f f t  right then applying uh power
in order to get um to s to power domain and then i f f t  right so you get
the auto correlation coefficients so before you're applying uh power spectrum you can again get
the you have got a complex f freq frequency or complex spectrum you can get the phase right
and the phase look quite similar like this so you might see it's is more less like a line
right
yeah
right
yeah it's it is very different yeah then you are doing in different domain i think this is in frequency
domain this in time domain um it is quite it's quite sensible to any quantization what i found
really it looks like the lines so you just say okay let's p let's put the line there but it doesn't work re well you can understand
but you can here that there are many artifacts which right exactly
right right and the another problem is that uh it's not band width variable so you cannot say that this part will be the
just the noise which you can do in here in this this other approach so that's why i didn't play with that so m
more because i found there are more uh disadvantages than the advantages this
approach so that's why
you mean this one yeah if you take just the original phase and the
right yeah it's it's it's not a phase yeah yeah yeah it's the phase no you can again put the that envelope with this phase together because envelope is twe
no no you g no you get the f
yeah you get the complex complex spectrum with this
no no i started with the d c t 
no after d c t  you are trying this is so kind of again a real trajectory right and you're trying
to first find that hilbert envelope so uh let's well
so this is a speech no but here what i want to say is really that y
it's not part of hilbert envelope it's part of the d c t  signal so
it's not it's enough if you have just this phase and f and the hilbert envelope you can put it together
you don't need the carrier i mean this is kind of a carrier signal but in different domain represented
right right

so i what i think is that we already will need to apply s kind of analysis by synthesis approach mm uh in order to get something
right
what i
no you mean ye
right
right right yes that's true but i mean that's maybe even the advantage here because you it's not speech d based which means we are not
right so you can when i tried and comparing with l p c  ten on a uh twice
bigger or higher bit rate this work works better it seems to me just for unvoiced speech o i'm not
mentioning uh voiceless because that's unvoiced which means whispered
uh yeah but uh when you hear and try to use some examples with the music for example
right yeah
mm hmm that's true yeah
uh but anyway it seemed to me pretty good i mean that there might be that's true yeah
uh it should be uh thirteenth december i think
i just uh you won't be here uh okay
no i just swapped it with uh mike perrot i think 'cause h he is not going to be here this time and
i was supposed to have it in uh in january so whatever
anyway so but anyway i i wanted to hear something maybe from you what you are doing f with speech coding because you were you mentioned that
by
but it was based on like you were using kind of recognizer there right
uh huh
right right
yeah it's i'm i mean yeah it's different but uh it's speech coding at least
i think so
right yeah sure
band you mean right
with different
i don't know but maybe what we can already do is uh to decrease this uh this distance we can do
a hilbert envelope approximation with one second but then we can split that signal into i don't know
ten ten uh segments with the one hundred milliseconds or even less and we can apply some other technique
for that you know still
right exactly exactly
yeah
well th more less they don't care what's uh what will be the quality of the of the or the bit
rate they just want to get something new you know so if you get the v very uh low
bit rate with a reasonable quality or really high bit rate which is c again different but with uh high quality
uh they would be happy with the both so you know on one side it's pretty good but on the other you don't know
which way you should go 'cause there are many of them and uh
right right
okay well i i will
w uh do you want to mention your speech coding experiments so you are saying that you're doing something i in india with uh
so you know the sub mm like um more details
oh yeah okay
right right
right i see
yeah but it's quite interesting with the even with th uh s current speech coding uh technologies we are
they are still trying to use k zap or those r p  based approaches there is nothing new more or less
and if i when i was uh listening the uh the talk of uh milan jelinek uh he's
the czech guy but he lives in uh in canada i don't know the name of the university but they they have uh the pattern i
think for celp even or
um i don't know how it is exactly but they got very very famous for this for that
celp what they did exactly i don't know if something different a little bit or not or they just keep those patterns
or i don't know how it is exactly maybe hynek will know much more but uh when i heard those
that presentation they didn't do so much new i mean uh it was last year and uh i think hynek he was asking wh so what's
new that you are so famous with that and they n they said okay we we know exactly how to do that i mean
you know not to make any errors like in because everybody knows how to do that but uh it's not so easy
to implement it right so uh there is nothing so much new really like
yeah
right
right
exactly
right
right ri right exactly exactly but then they are s still using like error signal which is going to be approximated by
code book right and a linear prediction which is use which is approximating just the spectrum
of for for and everything that that's that's all so still
right yeah yeah
right


well i hope that we still have a a lot of time for that because uh
i think yeah it's pretty interesting yeah
for example when i was uh you know harmonic voice modelling that h m m  system which is using used for synthesis more less it's pretty interesting i mean it it works it works well
right
right
yeah yeah it is
you mean uh in sinusoidal uh modelling
yeah and but anyway do you know exactly how it is done when you really have those m f c c  coefficients
which means magnitude spectrum and then you are trying to reconstruct the speech without a phase
because i i tried you know those th those papers but s i'm little confused about it i don't know how it works
but
which one

yeah that would be nice
oh
you know m but there are some algorithms which were quite uh
yeah yeah yeah yeah
uh it seems to me yeah something like that like try
you know what you can do um maybe what you can do is uh take just the minimum phase of
which you can get from a linear prediction right you know what i mean minimum phase signal and it sounds quite uh reasonably
the two but of course they are li it's not original at all so i don't know how they do that exactly
no i've no idea
right true right
for n for aurora we didn't do anything with that
yeah but we didn't do any speech recon re reconstruction yeah yeah yeah sure
right

right
right right

you mean with this phase uh sure yeah
yeah they do some kind of reconstruction of speech uh yeah
right that's true yeah
right yeah
yeah so
yep yep
mm hmm mm hmm sure yeah

okay
so how about you

yeah
yeah
you mean like channel and source coding together
or no
well i can imagine kind of like j  peg operations which might be more less like it's source coding and then we also channel coding because we just smooth the or just i don't know i don't know
right right right r right right
i don't know
i don't know so much about s channel coding like those huffman coding stuff and you know i mean
it's just standard yeah they're just standard techniques but
yeah exactly yeah yeah
i think so h yeah end okay thank you guys
uh if you find some good paper which you might
there was that fam fam waveform pro prototyping cor
that's great
alright let me just powerpoint this up
right so um this meeting will be about the conceptual design don't ask me s precisely what conceptual design
is it's just something important that we need to do um think of it 's kind of uh turning the abstract
into slightly more concrete in this meeting ideally we'll come to some final decisions on what we're gonna do for the prototype
um right so um apologies for the last meeting it was brought to my attention that i did not make the roles
clear enough um so i will attempt to do so more accurately in this particular meeting um
fair enough thanks for the input 's always good um
so basically all we're gonna do is have some presentations again much like last time um and gonna go through you uh whoever
wants to go first is f fine by me um and we'll collate what we know about um
what we discussed in the last meeting possible directions and then we'll make some more decisions on um
basic uh firm up our idea on how we want this remote control to look and work so
perfect so without th further ado whoever wants to go first is free to
alright nathan take it away
it is nathan right i'm not calling you the wrong name over and over again good


nice
mm
hmm
what kind of th thickness are we looking at
okay brilliant
hmm

hmm
m maybe is there an option that we can have that off or on so a person can select like
yeah i like the idea it's a good idea
yeah

mm
mm
mm can we do marketing piloting too try to see what kind before we launch can we see how they're received
okay okay
okay perfect great thank you very much nathan that's perfect so i guess that makes sense for you to take it from here

fascinating compelling even


tomatoes

slick slick
interface oh the interface graphics for the um
yeah
mm
yeah it's like yep it's ubiquitous isn't it




great thanks for that sarah ron

yeah


lot of single people on the um on the re on the remote control research team at the
mm
mm


yeah i can see
mm
great
great wonderful ron cool lot of good ideas good facts to have
that's what they need it's like a little dongle it just sticks up this further so you don't have to stand up every time just connect it my kingdom
right so good to know all that stuff thanks guys um now we kind of have to
come to some decisions um i figure we can just go down the line and all three of us can have a chat about it
um
based on what nathan presented as far as the um various costs and benefits um i think i dunno what do you guys think about the touch screen at this point
'kay
'kay
mm hmm
to produce each one
mm
hmm
well
there is it's just it is a question of and how much ca o does that mean we're gonna have to increase
the price to make money um from twelve fifty if we d wanna get our fift uh hundred per cent profit margin
um that would mean selling it from twenty five if you multiply seventeen fifty by two that's thirty five
so

from the board um well
that's true i mean
and that's to be fair the um the per cent of the market we're not going for mass
any you know mass sales anyway we're gonna make i mean we we're not talking about selling eight zillion of these
things we just couldn't not for twenty five euros so
we could probably maybe shrink the profit margins rather than selling for twenty five sell 'em for thirty but that's something that
we can have finance deal with um i say that we provisionally go with the touch screen
or wh y wh what was your thought on the matter ron

mm
no we could have a s very simple touch screen you know there's always the opportunity if it's gonna be about the size of the ipod or whatever
you know w we yeah i guess we can play around with it a bit alright let's let's say that okay so the touch screen will be our um
our main selling point here
so
the voice rec thing i mean if if we're looking at bottom line now we're looking at upping the cost to seventeen to get the touch screen on i think we might have to drop the voice rec
yeah
hmm what do you think on it nathan about the voice rec
mm
yeah
i can't see how it wouldn't i mean there's you know the old aphorism you can have it fast you can have it cheap or you can have it quality pick two of three you know you can't you can't have all three it's just impossible
well if we're gonna pick betwe e alright so we have to pick between one of the two um
otherwise yeah we just it just becomes cost prohibitive what which which do we suspect we should hold o we should hold on to
'kay
what does the cost look like ron is it cheaper to do the v r  or to do the uh touch screen
nathan
mm
right

mm
okay so i'm getting alright so more or less you guys think that o o of the two of 'em the voice recognition will be better okay yeah
okay sorted we will omit the touch screen in favour of voice recognition
yeah well we'll we'll sic we'll sort out what it what f what else we're gonna talk about for the prototype but yeah that's our next step it'll be a developing of prototype
yes
we'll just run through it yeah yeah um you discussed either a lithium or a solar power would the solar power be enough to fuel a voice recognition or this kinesthetic one would that be enough to fuel a voice recognition remote control
mm
mm yep
right
okay what do you think ron
okay
hmm
yeah
well we have to have buttons on it too as well but that's done that's no bother i mean if you look at the catalogue from
places like with sharper image or whatever you know they might have or like um who is it apple makes these really
pretentious speakers with the th sub woofers you know like clear and glass and you know and then they got these little pyramidal
type of um speakers i mean why not have a little rounded kind of thing it could still have the basic buttons on it
um 'cause we're going for basic functionality primarily as well
and maybe a menu button and so forth you know um use a channel button to scroll through the menu d if they want to record programmes or whatever you know i mean we can sort that out
yeah
mm
yeah i mean a nice although we do um wh uh is i'm recalling that she mentioned that we n need to get away from the surgical white
kind of brushed aluminium thing and get back to it but you could have a very tasteful um wood
coloured or earth tone kind of um
still i mean yeah along those lines yeah i like that i like that idea a lot um let's see what we can do as
far as that goes and the uh the material like the plastics and so forth we were discussing that being uh using
like a rubber kind of softer feel um you know li lik if you feel the the tip on this pen it's
a bit gives just a bit you know something where it's uh a a more advanced
f form of plastic that has some kind of a tactile response to it
mm 'kay
yeah let's see if we can do a squishy non remote control looking remote control but to be fair yeah i mean you just c you could just put it literally put it on the the ni the coffee table next to the telly and say volume up
yeah i like it i like the idea that's good um and we've sorted of discussed costs um i guess we'll a that's gonna be uh a thing if we run a bit over budget that might be okay um
we'll have more of an idea when the prototype
have more of a we'll have more of an idea later on um and we just yeah go from there
um so we've revisited the touch screen and more or less ruled that out um i think so we're
more or less con we wh wh we're more or less in agreement that we want to have a um a simple
kind of function you know not too complex
like maybe have menu things
mm
yes
yeah we've also got the the me the thing of if we're gonna have a non remote looking remote how do we yeah
b but no i mean we could do a slide or a compartment you know like if it say it's a lit little vaguely ovoidal type of thing it'd
be easy to have a compartment in there or you know a b a b a a series of you know three or four buttons with a menu button
and then a side an s up and down type of thing like on um like on a d v d  player you know you see the modern d v d  players'll just
have um a menu button on the side and then four buttons around them and you can just kind of manoeuvre
through the menu like that
well it seems like i dunno it seems to me that we could just do the um stick with the rubber 'cause since we're probably gonna be using some kind of um rubber for the outside case we might as well stick with that um
mm 'kay um
we've already kind of covered this as well that seems to be selling um and we we've more or less agreed that we want
to kar target this youth market um
especially now with eighteen to thirty five year olds being such a large quantity of the population
mm hmm mm hmm
okay
um
yeah alright well more or less covered what we need to cover i think fi an an any final thoughts before we think about doing the protot moving on to the prototype
right i was just gonna step on to um
i wasn't oh my bad um sorry the um
yeah okay i was just gonna assign tasks in the next b anyth any oth any other final thoughts before we go ahead and
cool
um
yeah
well then again colours wouldn't be so hard to do you could have uh a you know a um uh kind of a natural
wood colour like a stained wood and um i don't know olive green or something
that wouldn't be so much of a problem to incorporate into the colour of the thing
yeah i think that's probably a good id okay so let's work on uh multiple case colours
but yeah stick with the same kind of kinda yeah the same basic non remote kind of remote design
cool
alright so we'll have the next meeting about half an hour um i
want the uh i'd like nathan i'd like you to work on just the basic look and feel what can we accomplish um
given these parameters that we're just gonna sort of have this kind of uh non remote remote um
what are our broad constraints before we deve design a prototype and um ron if you can
figure out how probably best to lay out this idea of this simple design with the voice recognition
built in and also this kind of drop down or s on the side kind of menu
options simple somehow work out how we can get this all s in the same place
um and if you can check product evaluation with m some pilots and stuff um i need you guys to work together on making a
prototype um using um prototype building materials
um and also um specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches as well so that's what to
start with for now is that alright you guys feel clear about this
alright i guess we'll just hit the bricks thanks guys
'kay
i'll go first
no nathan's fine it's either nathan or participant two
uh
okay um basically what i'm gonna have to talk to you about today is
um component design and it's been brought to my attention that we may be somewhat limited
as to what we can do because of what our manufacturer offers so basically what i'm gonna be doing is talking to you
about that
um components of a remote control okay we've already kind of gone over this but we're gonna have to get into more detail and probably have to reach some conclusions some time soon
energy source um our manufacturer offers a variety of energy sources your standard battery
solar cells our manufacturer didn't say anything about lithium so we might have to look if we do go that route we might have to look
elsewhere um and also there's a kinetic energy possibility basically it's like a um
the idea of moving the remote would create enough energy to keep it running so that's one possibility but i don't know whether that would
be powerful enough to illuminate a touch screen so we'll have to look into that
um the case we have a few options plastic rubber
or wood um and then as far as the way it's shaped we can do standard
boring flat which we probably don't wanna do curved or very sexy double curved
um i imagine that we could specify um i don't see any reason to go outside of the convention of
three or four millimetres yeah
um the buttons there are multiple scroll buttons available from our manufacturer but
to use those we'd have to use more chips um and that would cost us more
and if we do go with the rubber doubled curved case um we'll have to use rubber push buttons
because the other buttons aren't compatible with that um and just a little note there touch
screen equals many chips which equals many euro
um one thing that i noticed was that most remotes operate on
a infrare on the infrared part of the spectrum so you notice when you push a button on a remote you can't see
anything coming out of it but in fact there is light coming out of the remote and you know the television can detect that and if you
were to record if you were to make a video recording you could actually see the light
uh one thing that i thought might be interesting was to use part use visible light coming
out of the remote just kind of as a fun gimmick so you could actually see something coming out of the remote when you pushed it
course it'd have to be a part of the spectrum that wouldn't damage the human eye or anything like that
yeah i am sure that we could do that um of course
yeah just as a fun gimmick
just to set us apart a little bit um and then on to the circuit board that we're gonna use also known as the
chip uh we really don't have any way around the t a  one one eight three five
um findings okay we're very limited by what our current manufacturers can offer
um and my question to all of you is should we look to other manufacturies or should we just make do with what
we have available
's a bit of a challenge question
right that's my concern too
um if we do go the lithium battery route then we'll have to go outside our current manufacturer
my personal preference is i'll just throw my cards on the table uh i think we should probably go the solar battery route
just to kinda keep with the environmentally friendly theme that we have going on uh i like
the idea of the visible light signalling that's something to set us apart and uh i was thinking about
i was thinking of ways that we could produce the remote in a variety of different case materials to suit different tastes
so we're not so confined by one style and say some you know say our the one if we just go with one and it doesn't go over well then we're in a bad situation
oh yeah you're welcome


mm

mm
hmm
i should have mentioned this um as far as the rubber that we can use we can use a rubber as part of the case it has a consistency of those stress balls
mm
i like the idea of of rubber too because it's tends to be associated with being durable something that you can drop and it doesn't matter 'cause so many you go to so many houses these days and you see broken remote controls
taped with duck tape and what have you you wouldn't have that problem if you used rubber







mm
no


yeah
my estimate is that in order to incorporate touch screen technology it's gonna cost us upwards of seventeen fifty euro per remote yeah that's just an estimate though

i know it's fun
i thought there was some flexibility with that
that's just off the top of my head it is pending further emails
right
it is the new it would be in a class of its own

it's true we could initially go with what we have and if we can find them cheaper later on
yeah
i think if we we do both the obviously production costs are going to go way up um but it does put it into it'd become the rolls royce of remote controls basically it would be very nice
yeah 'cause you you just upping the number of chips that you need to deal with each different function
i would have to side with that i think the voice recognition is simpler we already have the all the technology in house it's ready to go it's packaged it's
um this is just off the top of my head keep in mind but i think the voice recognition would
they're both mm they're both gonna push the costs up but um
since we already have the technology in house for the voice recognition we're not gonna have to do as much design
work and sometimes the design work is what push the costs up if you know what i mean


yeah
are we going to talk now about um the materials that we're gonna use for the case and all those things okay
um the solar power definitely would be but i think just to keep people from getting annoyed 'cause sometimes solar power fails and there's no way round that we should install a small backup battery
just to cover those moments when for whatever reason the remote hasn't been exposed to
it's true yeah it works about the same as a solar powered calculator and you know how those those don't
really require that much light um but obviously a little more light than a calculator but we're not talking about
a lot of light doesn't have to be out taking a sunbath for a few hours a day or anything
hmm
why why moving away from hand held why what's the uh idea
hmm
do you think people that are people that buy a remote are they always gonna wanna use the voice recognition or is it just something that they do sometimes
right
i think i think you're on to something because we need to escape the traditional shape of a remote maybe something that looks nice on a table is would be good even though and hand held the same time
yeah those are nice
mm

okay
right
just kind of the squishy feel

sorry about the uh lack of information on cost i just haven't been provided that information by our manufacturers and i'm just having to guess
right
if if we're not going the touch screen route then we can um just incorporate maybe something that folds
out like what you often see on these kinds of remotes is the most basic functions up here and something that slides down
to reveal the you know more complicated things
yeah
right
so are we gonna are we talking we need to figure out what kind of buttons we're going to use are we going to use scroll buttons rubber buttons um
right
right

so have we decided that we are gonna go with different style cases for different people or are we just going to go with one
 it's very it's very hard thing to predict because you have different cases and that might open up your market a little bit obviously
but if you have just one case and it doesn't go very well mm it's a tough situation but
obviously having more cases also costs more so
there's an idea
right


oh excellent yeah
that sounds good
mister participant two that is


interesting question
yes
did you





i like it i like it
yes
fabulous
we can have a duck tape casing

it could go with the granola crowd

phew
computer's adjusting one moment please so interme interface concept by your faithful user interface designer
so yur user interface guys is basically aspects of a computer system that we can see
or hear or otherwise uh perceive uh commands and mechanisms
that basically user uses to control the operator operating system here's a d series of different remote
controls that are out on the market today i think we're definitely trying to get away from this kind of a look um
so
the following are a bunch of different uh interface uh concepts uh voice recognition
we we um actually have some new uh information from our research
design team but uh i'll get to that in a moment um so current voice recognition starts up to about eighty
speech samples um and basically you record your own verbal labels c and connect them to the remote control
now our design team research team has been able to uh set up a system in
which uh you can teach the remote control voice c recognition system to respond
to um with standard responses like you could say good morning uh
remote control and it'll say in a sexy female voice good morning joe um
in fact we already have this for a coffee maker line
on the remote control right
um another concept is what uh apple has come up with the spinning wheel with uh l c  display
like on the uh ipod which i am sure most of you know about um and then we have the scroll
button with integrated push button kind of like a modern a bit bulky a bit crazy i don't think that's
we're necessarily going for and uh some special components uh ideas
like uh blocking having the ability to block channels from your for your children um
and uh dedicated buttons for for commonly used uh channels and even uh
ideas like secured or hidden programming but uh i again if we go with touch screen i don't think that's a big issue
um
and uh this is kind of the uh the big daddy of remote controls here
uh the jumbo universal remote control is almost impossible to misplace or lose
um again probably not what we're going for so i i mean my ideas here and kind of where i think we're heading
is something slightly larger than a regular ipod uh with a hard cla c uh plastic casing although i think some
of the suggestions we've come up with are definitely uh very good ideas uh changeable casings uh
our design team was possibly talking about including one extra face plate with the package to kind of
set the idea that you can change it and you can try changing it and kind of get used to thinking about maybe buying another
one which can add value to our uh bottom line
uh touch screen interface um possibly having go to buttons being uh stuck into the system
so those don't move away from the screen uh the important ones like power volume and jump between channels
um and of course our voice command system which i've talked a little bit about already and uh the use
of recognisable colours and shapes to aid recognition of the features um that are around so
red for power um arrows for different volume ups and downs and channels
ups and downs and what not and uh perhaps even adding in some stupid little jokes with the voice
recognition idea like perh mm for instance my toastie maker that i got from my bank
has jokes when it's ready
and uh that is about it


oh you guys are always the dampers on these projects
you industrial designers
where do you guys come up with these numbers




i'm thinking that's uh definitely a good idea and i also think that we could probably come up with some sort of a cheaper uh means to to go about this kind of production my my team in the uh on the third floor suggested that uh
yeah
i mean i think that we really have two main selling points i think that our casing and the voice recognition

to be honest we have the capa we have the design in house i mean we've we've come up with this with this new voice we're using it for our coffee machines already
i can pass you on that email from my uh guy in uh guy down the hall sounds good
i mean we we have to r reflect back on what our market research did say
does having both really up our costs
well my p is
um i definitely have to agree with that last comment
it's you and me outside a little here
calculator
i'm willing to agree with everything that's been said uh i have to say though that um another
idea's come up in my head if we're really not uh handling the remote control to a great extent
we could possibly get away from the idea of having a hand held remote control and maybe kind of have a
round remote control that kind of looks like a paperweight or something like that kind of a sleek
little uh neat thing that sits on your table or something
just a thought
well if you don't need to pick it up it could kind of be a selling point
i think it's all about following apple's lead on a lot of these things
mm hmm
exactly



think then we're hitting our cost issue again
i think to a certain extent we have to stick with uh kind of uh a little bit traditional in terms of the buttons and then and then make our unique feature our casing and what not and our voice command
well what are we actually doing what were
sure
and again copying imac's kind of for ipod mac apple's uh colour scheme

fabulous

that went well thank you
perfect
go ahead


nice
mm
right
right nice
interesting
mm good call
choose it
well i'd say shop around but with our time constraints is that really a feasible option
right
right
um
it's an option uh but actually there's i've got some research already on like what we're looking at and trends in casing right now which actually might even come into play beforehand it may help us decide for now temporarily anyway
i guess so 'cause i found some interesting things
you waiting for me i know what a teaser ain't it um right
so current market trends
screen um basically i was looking at what's going on in the remote control market right now and
what's going on in other design fields to see sort of what's what's trendy what's new what's happening um remote
control right now basically everybody says they want newer fancier more exciting they're sick of this boring
normal functional um that we need innovative design options and there needs to be an easy user
interface um the challenge is that current trends right now across the board in fashion
in furniture in technology is a very organic fruit and vegetable kind
of thing
now i'm not saying we should have you know tomato shaped remote controls or anything but i think it is possible maybe to use um natural colours like if wood is an option that whole organic sleek clean
v line thing may be something we can look into different skin options or if we can't afford this
touch plate thing or touch face screen interface um maybe having
the b images be specific like you could choose your menu bullets to be
a different shape or okay not the example i would choose but you know what i mean to t sort of
and th apparently the feel of the next couple of years is spongy uh not something
i i've come up with a though if we can get around to getting piloting i thought maybe a casing option
like uh
not like a skin but like a holder almost if you could do like um leather options or wood options or something
mm hmm
mm might be an interesting way to go
um yeah so something to sit on for now so overall i think we should stick
with what we're finding everyone's looking for easy to use technologically innovative and this fancy new
i think perhaps the double curve thing and maybe this rubber option is our best way to go for right now
um
yeah um well i d but then if the touch screen thing isn't gonna work out for us that's really a non issue
true
very true very true very much so um
we could i think that goes against the whole fancy something a new line but worth a shot
ah it could be it could be um yeah that's what i know
no problem



mm
yeah very true very true
mm
hmm


okay
mm right
mm

nice
mm
mm
i think it's our most marketable feature just because it's so new and it's something that is showing up in other places
but can we really afford it 'cause it looks like they would be that would be a really main cost source then right
per
piece
i know
and our goal was to be under twelve fifty or we have to be under twelve fifty do we remember
okay
can we justify it
right
though i think that's what people would pay for i mean if you're gonna pay for an expensive high class remote you're gonna expect it to do something
yeah
right
yeah
see if we can cut some corners
right well and we can look into this other manufacturing option and maybe we can get 'em somewhere else cheaper
right
it's a starting point anyway so
mm
yeah 'cause with voice recognition
i mean really this is pretty bells and whistles kinda remote
i think we'd have to decide between 'em definitely
price wise
true we've already got it
pretty much
right and they said they wanted voice recognition course maybe they hadn't thought of this whole touch screen option but definitely we know the market is there for voice recognition so to say we have the technology and we're not gonna use it even though we know it'll sell
is a call i don't think i can give the highs ups like really i can't go in and say no we're gonna just ignore everything we know
yeah
yeah
well we already have research backing voice recognition as you know
fiscally solvent but uh i i i personally would tend to another direction but if that's what's gonna sell i think that's what we need to go with and maybe we can table this touch screen for our next model
mm
right
right
and we're still not then we don't have to deal with this battery issue nearly as much either we can stick with what we've already got
in a lot other ways too
i think it's our lower risk option which for right now we can have it on the market sooner which is all in all our best option
so and when are we gonna have basic prototypes coming up next that's you guys's next step right
right
okay
mm hmm
yeah
well what of people with like the t v  in their basement like what if wha we can't guarantee sunlight everywhere so having a secondary source is probably

yeah true true
right
okay
uh
interesting
i if it's got voice recognition it can be technically anywhere in your room and still do its job
true and i probabl i think we're banking on selling it to more than just voice recognition people like we want it to work fundamentally as a basic manual too right
mm hmm
yep
yeah
with the bu yeah
mm hmm
true
way to go
yeah i'm thinking of the airport portal you know like that little pod looking thing
right
that would be kinda neat
terracotta bowl or something
mm
mm
yeah
yeah which is the next big thing so that's not gonna hurt us either
right
handy
okay
mm
right well when the majority of people are only using the most primary functions on a daily basis
although i'm not saying we should completely rule out major functions they should be secondary at least
if not functionally then visually like those shouldn't be
take precedence yeah
right
and they slide
well and do we wanna consider like an ipod screen which isn't a touch screen but you're still scrolling through menu options in p
true we're still not making it easier then
true
fair enough
yeah
mm hmm
yeah it's just a scroll
yeah
yeah
probably
right
mm
well no it's basic just like four directions that are that can use as menu or channel and volume or however you wanna
do it are really versatile and everybody's already got them to some extent on the remotes they already own so
it's not like we're dealing with everybody relearning things 'cause that's not something anybody's gonna wanna buy a new for
mm
right particularly in technological fields so that's exactly where we're headed
uh
oh it wasn't in the way but yeah whatever
no don't worry about it
okay
yeah
yeah
right
mm
yeah
yeah get in there
yeah totally

cool
cool

okay good morning everybody um i'm glad you could all come i'm really excited to start this team um i'm just gonna have a little powerpoint presentation for us for our kick off meeting my name is rose lindgren i i'll be the project manager
um our agenda today is we are gonna do a little opening and then i'm gonna talk a little bit about the project then we'll move into acquaintance
such as getting to know each other a little bit including a tool training exercise and then we'll move into the project plan
do a little discussion and close since we only have twenty five minutes
first of all our project aim um we are creating a new remote control which we have three goals about it needs to be original
trendy and user friendly i'm hoping that we can all work together to achieve all three of those
um so we're gonna divide us up into three compa three parts first the functional design
which will be uh first we'll do individual work come into a meeting the conceptional design individual work
and a meeting and then the detailed design individual work and a meeting so that we'll each be doing
our own ideas and then coming together and um collaborating
okay we're gonna get to know each other a little bit so um what we're gonna do is start off with um
let's start off with amina um alima sorry alima um we're gonna do a little tool
training so we are gonna work with that whiteboard behind you um introduce yourself um say
one thing about yourself and then draw your favourite animal and tell us about it
probably both
how do you spell your name
how do you spell your name
so what are your favourite characteristics
mm
excellent shall we just go around the table
mm
might be nice to have them all up there at same time
em

mm 'kay
mm 'kay i'm rose and i'm project manager from california
um
hmm

s
um it's actually a coyote let's see let's see let's give it a little bit of a snout i don't know some teeth
yeah
oh dear yes i live um i live right across the street from an open space in california we have
coyotes howl all the time so i really enjoy their their singing you they're really beautiful animals
mm
okay um moving on to
slightly more serious stuff we're gonna talk about project finances
um we have a couple we'd like to sell it for about twenty five euro with the profit aim
of um fifteen million euro um from our sales and because this is such this is for television
it's a we have a market range of internet like it's an international market range we don't have to worry about specifics
um in order to make a profit of this magnitude we need to um be able to produce each one at a maximum of twelve fifty euro so we're selling it for twice what we'd like to produce it for
okay um just to generate a little bit of discussion about the project um i
could i'd like to hear about your experiences using ro remote controls um your first ideas about um
creating a new r remote control what would be the best um like you what are the features that you really like what
are the features that you don't like etcetera so
hmm
mm
mm hmm
um i would imagine all of them but we could but it's possible we could use like a lithium battery um that would last
a lot longer than like double a s um like tho those are the batteries that are used in a lot of um m p  three players
now and that kind of thing um
um okay it seems we have a little bit of a conflict over um
to uh combining all the remotes cont together versus having f five different remotes so
um like you said you don't like having all the buttons on one on one remote and yet you don't wanna have
five remotes so how do we work with that
mm hmm
mm
mm
okay so maybe have like one remote that has the main functions on off channel changing volume and another rote remote with
all the special things because that is one thing that um remotes tend to have buttons that the t v s no longer have
as well so like you have to have them somewhere 'cause you're gonna m need those special functions occasionally um
but not necessarily on the m the normal remote
good question
i don't know that yet
it's a good question um
i'll look into that
if i can
mm
mm
okay 'kay sounds like we've had a good little discussion for our first ideas mind if we move on ps
mm okay um now our next meeting starts in thirty minutes
i believe we've actually been only working on this this one for about twenty so we can continue discussing more new ideas if you'd like
um
but this is just a breakdown of what we'll be doing individually um the industrial design alima
will be doing um the working design um the user interface designer
that's for technical functions i guess like keeping in mind the buttons thing the size of the buttons
um user requirements um so you'll be hearing about different trends uh about different things
that people need um i guess kind of the same uh discussion that we've been having we'll get from the actual consum s consumers
mm 'kay um and you will get specific instructions sent by your personal coach i realised
in this past one we we didn't have much we just wanted to get a little brain storming done um so
very exited to see all your animals and how what wonderful um artists we all are
um
any questions
i haven't gotten an agenda yet um i'll put that together i'm sure as we'll each get our own instruction and then um
because what we gonna do is first our individual actions and then we'll come back together so i'm
sure we'll all have more concrete things to contribute next time
mm 'kay um i'll type up mi minutes and probably email those out to all of you um just including all the things that we talked about um
yes i yes i think i can mm hmm i'll just attach it to an email and you're you're number two three four is that correct okay
excellent it was lovely meeting you all
just make sure you keep checking the company web site and the emails
let me see if i can do that right now

alima


okay um i don't know which one of these i have to bring with me
right so i'm supposed to draw my favourite animal i have no drawing skills whatsoever but uh
let's see introduce myself my name is alima bucciantini um i'm from the
state of maine in the us i'm doing nationalism studies
blah blah blah and i have no artistic talents
a  l  i  m  a 
oh and i guess i'm the industrial designer on this project so let's see if i can get
um here i will draw a little turtle
for you all not necessarily 'cause it's my absolute favourite animal but
just that i think they're drawable
and you have the pretty little shell going on
some little eyes happy
there you go that's a turtle
um i i like the whole having a shell thing it's quite cool carry your home around
where you go um quite decorative little animals they can swim they can they're very adaptable
they carry everything they need with them um and they're easy to draw
no you can erase the turtle it's alright

snake well snake it's w


oh a cat
yeah
right
that's
that's pretty impressive

yeah um
i agree with having too many remotes around my dad has a whole drawer at home of remotes for various things and i don't know how to work half of them um
what's important for me i guess is that it's easy to use and that there's not too many buttons they are not too small you know you know you need to n to know what you're doing
and one thing i particularly like is if you are not um sort of moving it around to get
it to work with the infra red um i think there is a way around that but i know in my residence
right now the the television you sort of have to walk all around the room to get it to turn on so i it's just simpler
just to just turn around the t v  itself and i think that's if we're gonna make a remote control it should actually work for what
it's doing
so
i know
yeah something that doesn't
mm
yeah could we get something that
just has
no doesn't have all the buttons that you need to program the video recorder or program s other
things that i'm not very coherent about but that just has your major buttons for
that work for everything you know volume control on off
channel changing
yeah
n that way
yeah
yeah and if um if you'd save the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes that you wouldn't need to use every day
um
yeah
mm
right
mm
mm yeah

yes i guess we have to define what what we're aiming for if it's just a television then that it's a bit simpler 'cause there's less buttons that would even need to be on it
large if you have older people or people like me that aren't very co ordinated hand eye it's really quite important that you are not pressing a small like teeny mobiles phone size buttons if we can help it

hmm
yeah

'kay
i'm sure we'll be busy
i'm two
alright
'kay

uh okay well my name is iain uh
and i'm the user interface designer for the project um
and
i'll try and draw my favourite animal
i'll i should leave that one on there shouldn't i before i callously rub it off

um i'm not gonna draw it quite to scale um
is that at least identifiable
it's a whale yes thanks um and yeah the reason
i like whales is 'cause uh they're well first of all they're quite intelligent um and also they're
they're kind of mysterious like we don't really know much about them or or understand how they
work how they form groups and i just find them interesting animals
cool

i've used i've used remote controls for things like t v  and the c d  player and video recorder and
i i guess they're they're pretty neat neat little tools uh you don't have to get up and walk across the room to change a channel so especially if you're someone really lazy like me they they're pretty nice um
i find them they can be a bit annoying especially like you know if i'm watching t v  i have have to have three separate remote controls of in front of me you know one for the t v  one for the digital box one for m the video recorder as well um
and also they tend to they tend to be a bit confusing they've got too many buttons on them uh too too sort of too sort of complicated when all i really wanna do is switch on and off change the channel change the volume
yeah
mm
yeah
can i ask are we designing a remote control for a television only um and if if this device is just to be used for the television
would we even technically be possible to include video recorder functions on it
um or should we just stick to just stick to having television television related buttons on it


so we should maybe we should assume that i t it's just a television that we're wanting to control
well i mean i suppose it would be nice to have playing and record and stop buttons on it for the video recorder as well i i don't know if that works technologically or not
yeah
yeah
'kay

what we're gonna be discussing at the next meeting do we know that
right
yep
yep

okay
can you e mail your slides as well is that possible
cool
'kay


hmm


yes
well
oh my god it's better than what i'm gonna be able to do
take my contraptions with me
alright i'm jessy i'm from around d c  ish sort of in the u s 
and we're gonna keep the deep sea sort of theme going on animal
don't really know how to draw this
just where can i
mm
mm
maybe if i do the water but how
sort of give an idea i have no idea how one would explain this
mm maybe with some whiskers
briefly it's supposed to be a seal
you can imagine it in the water i like them because they are like playful and silly sort of have a good time
not gonna try and pretend like i can get any better than that
it's definitely significantly harder once you are doing it
that's impressive
um i hate when there's like four different buttons and you have to press to actually turn on the t v  like you have to do one
for the power of the t v  and then like another one to get the actual screen on and something else to get it all going i
don't know now they keep combining all different remotes together and i don't know if i necessarily
like that 'cause i feel like you end up with multimedia overload i just wanna watch the t v  um

always gets lost some sort of like
device to help you find it
yeah
what about like batteries and things like that like are there some remotes that don don't require
like batteries or do all remotes require batteries
mm hmm
mm hmm
and maybe that spatially divides it so it's like if you're looki if you're trying to get the t v  on that's you know like the top thing on the remote
i dunno if d be vertical or horizontal in terms of how we're gonna make it but if it's like all the t v  stuff was here then all
the v c r  stuff was here all the whatever else we have programmed into it it's all just in its separate place and not like all
the on buttons together 'cause then you like i don't even know what i'm turning on

mm hmm
mm hmm hmm
i think it's just t v  i mean if it if we're taking it just new product a new television remote control that's not like doesn't say
you know things might be more advanced than that
it's an idea with the buttons being really
yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
i'm four
okay so now we are on the conceptual design meeting
uh y getting close to the last is the penultim meeting
mm great
so um i will again do the secretary part uh we will
have three presentation first um uh the industrial design first rama
then mark and then sammy um um we have to
take a decision on the control remote control concepts
and we have forty minutes
so what we want to the decision we want to take on this meeting
are on the um first on the component concept so what kind of energy we use
uh what kind of chip on print and one ki kind of case and also
on user interface concept uh what kind of interface we use and
if there is some supplements and at the end um sammy will give um a
trend watching on what he's he's been doing it's
so let's go first
with rama
participant two
mm hmm

mm hmm okay
um i want to know why it b uh just uh sorry but for the point before uh why not the rubber if it is something that it seems to be light
okay you m titanium it's more uh
yes so mm
uh huh
okay
okay
okay
okay
uh yeah so
okay s so simple button and uh speech recognition for the more complicated
okay
mm hmm
okay
mm
okay for the location
hmm
okay
so let's now go to the you don't have more question um mm thank you mm
yeah
yeah but mm
okay um
yeah now let's talk about uh interface
three
which one

okay
mm


no

mm hmm 'kay
mm hmm
because apparently from your survey people like colours no


okay
so
uh huh okay so you you propose something with option i that increase the price if we if you want o more colours on l c d  yeah
okay
and thermodynamic also mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah but that's maybe mo too much expensive yeah but uh it can be in uh maybe in an a gradable version but
mm hmm
okay and you think that we don't have to make to make them pay more because of uh o or this is
okay so
so i it's not uh a s base service it's a
mm
okay
mm hmm
so m so maybe that's if that it's a selling point maybe it has to be the base
and you'll be different uh in the train uh hello uh no want to change my neighbour
mm
mm hmm

iradium ah sorry mm
okay
so mm
mm hmm


mm that's a nice world
okay
mm
okay
mm
mm hmm


okay
so it's yeah marketing expert
participant two four sorry



mm




mm hmm
s
so maybe titanium it's not a good idea
mm hmm

um sorry mark it seems to be
mm mm
mm hmm
hmm you're old fashioned sorry

okay
mm you have questions

mm
mm hmm
okay

no more question
okay
so
mm hmm
okay so we will have uh next meeting in thirty minutes again um now you
have to go straight on this individual action which i which are for rama uh
wil design um mark the user interface design
and uh sammy uh the product evaluation uh you will work
together uh on a new on on a prototype using modelling clay
mm hmm um
and i as always your personal coach will send you specific instruction
yeah you're right you have to
so you say s
s do we agree on that yeah
we have to
no
okay that's a good idea so titanium smell like fruit mm hmm
mm hmm
okay
i i agree with uh this uh
now we have to decide on what kind of fanciness do we take titanium smelling like fruit or do we make spongy
uh fruity like
mm yeah yeah

don't you say that you cannot do double shape uh curved shape yeah
mm hmm okay
mm mm okay so you explore now that you're going to work together these these two or or spongy an yeah
mm
mm
yeah i don't think w i think we have to choose
if we choose uh titanium or if we choose spongy but uh it cannot be both

ah you can pretend that it's uh titanium
yeah do don't worry you you you speak with mm mm
okay so explore a shape
mm i think it's what we say that we have an uh an l c d  with uh information not uh
mm hmm
mm
mm
okay
yeah yeah yeah
mm
yeah
mm hmm

okay
so are we mm
okay so see you in thirty minutes
how was lunch
mm
why
mm hmm
w we can use something like you know the whole body's titanium but there are some rubber or i dunno some rubber parts like to make it feel better and to you know
yeah yeah
mm hmm
okay and still we have mm can we still include the l  l s d  display l c d  yeah l c d 
no it's not gonna be a t no touchable but still like a source of information or source for menus
okay so let's try it let's t
yeah yeah it's it's not gonna be a touch pad uh just a display for giving you information
mm hmm
mm hmm mm hmm
no more questions
mm yeah yeah
but still uh l s d 's already quite nice l c  i'm an artist sorry
so uh that's not i hope that's not too much okay uh
participant number three
uh
mm
mm uh have a look at this no it's yeah
uh so the concept of the interface generally i developed quite a broad concept not only for the interface but for
possible instruction or user's manual and uh all the complex
things that come together with your t v  and remote controls so let's start with this we got our perfect
remote control with a lot of buttons and uh we got explanation for every
button and you can use your time and uh it will take i some days to learn
all this buttons and um the l c d  is going to be somewhere here
and uh go back button i don't know really where it is maybe one of this buttons and
um power on and off mm i i don't remember so uh it
it it should be maybe this button is power on and off or no i can see nothing
so that's our concept it's called the millennium remote control
yeah
really i thought you like it ah okay just press the button please uh
yeah we will not use this we will not use this but instead of this i will devise that's our concept
and it's got just few buttons quite low looking and all this stuff we already
we already discussed and uh what will people say
they'll say it's perfect or what will say uh they will say it's splendid and uh e everyone will say i'll buy it and everyone's gonna be satisfied
i would make a backlight of the l c d  screen with different colours
not the case
yeah
okay so let's remember there's a nokia phone which changeable panels
do you like it
that's why you don't have it that's why 'cause it's nasty
no
um i am here
mm hmm
'kay
okay what uh there's one more decisi uh one more solution in fact um 'cause there are some some paints that can change colour according to where they are like they can reflect different colours
depending on what is around like what colour is around and depending on the temperature yeah
we can make it in fact if if if the okay
mm hmm mm hmm so
uh huh
so be an option yeah
yeah yeah yeah but you know if you want to be different you just take your remote control with you all the time
and it makes you different you know anyone has their remote controls here no
mm hmm
okay
uh huh uh huh could we integrate something into our remote control something like light
that they can use it in darkness like
hand light yeah
mm hmm
okay okay
okay s well let's go on maybe with the presentation and um the remote control's going to be smart but how smart should it be to not to complicate things too much
and uh
i dunno that's a question to you and to mm to
mm hmm
okay okay
so just just just just think about it um
thank you
uh yeah i just want to say it should be real smart
voice recognition is quite tough i say don't use it and the control just looks
'cause i ordered jus
to l to l lock it
yeah sure
mm hmm
okay thanks
what is spongy
okay
okay
so we have to uh for
yeah so are we confident enough on creating trends
well we can make it smell like fruit yeah
mm hmm mm hmm could we make a titanium shape
i mean fruit shaped
but
doub double curved
okay okay
in fact i just agreed to make uh
to make the like titanium panels
on a whole
rubber body
well okay w we'll see
yeah
we'll see we'll see
we'll see i i really don't like this modelling clay 'cause you know it makes some for for i dunno uh yeah um we'll look
okay okay
alright alright
mm hmm
yeah



ramaro
yeah participant two
component
yep
so we're to mainly design f mainly need to know which components we'll use for energy and
the material and interface for energy there are maybe two or three possibilities first
one we can use simple battery or we can use traditional solar cells
or mm and the material we can have plastic rubber
which is good for this r s a  and then uh titanium
which can be which have very good look an and then interface
we're to use push buttons or liquid crystal d l c d  display
and we can use some moving kind of thing
so as we discussed before we need to we would like to have some speech recognition s chip in our remote control
so this can be simple kind of programmable chip and which can use microphone
sensors and we also want to look
at our remote control so still we are looking for possible
uh technical uh specifications and how w easy we can do and within our
pri range like we're to in our twelve euros or around that so we
are looking for simple devices or simple technology to do the location of
remote control in a room or in a house
so uh we discussed an
excuse me
so we would like to propose battery instead of solar cells and it would be problematic uh
to have enough energy with the solar cells and so we would like to just use simple
battery and also we want to go for titanium design instead of
rubber or and well the problem is with this design we found that we can't use
double curved shapes
like you can have two curves
uh it's i think in manufacturing i guess it's problematic
so we want to go for simple push buttons because it need a simple
chip and it's really lesser uh re really less expensive compared to l c d  which are
uh which needs advanced chip technology and it's more expensive since we want to put some other features
such as speech recognition we want to reduce uh cost
uh
uh
and also like in if you put a it's be difficult to do all the moulding of buttons and these things and
yeah
yeah
like in cell phones recently these you can with the rubber in four directions and yeah but full assembly
we'll use mainly for titanium rubber is expensive and also it's bit
difficult to do all the shapes uh and this
push buttons we we would like to use push buttons instead of l c d s and so we want to
mo i mean we're we want to put speech recognition so we want to reduce price
on this technology and so that we can have enough space or enough money for
s s
y yeah we have simple buttons and speech recognition technology so
uh l
so uh it's like a
yeah maybe maybe we can see depending on how we'll come up with our full design then if we have
enough money or like for and because the speech recognition technology will take
at least five euros or or something so we want to reduce the cost on display
or this inter
ok
yeah that can we we can consider because like it won't take much money i guess because
okay yep you have any further questions or
yeah
yeah we're to go for li and now i think we have many options in the market so we can go for small nickel or alkaline batteries for
really light batteries and with uh good price
yeah that's then the the one thing we want to know is like because remote control
is used for like in the household so it it it will be it m maybe at least
five six people want to use it so so how to uh uh how to define
our re speech recognition whether we want to do s speaker independent or speaker dependent if we're going for more
speaker independent then it would be like again cumbersome and we need really m
more technology and so
yeah if if everybody in the house n to locate then we're to go for some speaker independent technology or something

yep thank you
yeah
oh we have uh some limitations


three





so maybe you can use in the end and
uh



mm
yeah
but it's uh
but it would be expensive no if you use colour l c d 
uh instead of that maybe we can change the colour of the assembler maybe we can just if users want more colours they can pay more money to get this
uh the shapes and they can have different assembly
so users have different i mean they have their own interests colour interests and so
so we can just if they want they can just pay another
two euro
yeah
yeah yeah yes if they want like uh so that we can yeah
yeah
just they'll get few more
things and few more colours
lights yeah
yeah
yeah yeah
mm
yeah


uh
mm
but those people will be really few no so like we can those
ah
yeah
mm


hmm

yeah maybe like the infrared like we can put some
radium chips or something so that like at least um yeah yeah that
oh



yeah
uh that mm that could be feasible i guess like
so since we have we want to do some speaker dependent speech recognition uh so we can use yeah
yeah yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
uh it's
hmm

four




mm
yeah kind of um maybe

yeah it
yeah
yeah

we need to think about mm mm
fruit
even shape
more yeah
yeah

mm


so these abilities are mainly ad addressed by young people or it's
this you you so did you
where
oh oh okay mm hmm it's not from mm
mm hmm
yeah
yeah it's more general trend it's not particular to the remote control
mm
yeah
yeah but some materials n they're to be
uh they're to be something like solid like they can't be really spongy or yeah yeah
yeah yeah sponge yeah yeah at least that's
yeah yeah that yeah yeah yeah
yeah looking yeah fruit these things can be easily incorporated we can have t colours or this shape or at least yeah
yeah
mm
yeah
look and feel de
hmm
hmm
mm sounds interesting
so can we highlight the specific features of our yeah so
so we want the speech recogniser and we want some kind of buttons and
we want some themes like fruits or vegetables that's we want to follow general trend
yeah
so do you think
hmm yeah
yeah

that's

so what about location and these things people are really interesting on those features or they really like
they more want these fancy features like
feature
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
uh we will try to explore these two options and yeah yeah
uh yeah at least like we can make banana or
yeah it's it's yeah that's a we're to look for and and s we're to see the whether rubber is expensive and d
hmm
mm
yeah maybe we can have two different assembly also like one spongy and one kind of titanium we have only the plastic or the the chippy yeah fibre chips or
uh
yeah
yeah
yeah
even design

so still we want to keep l c d  or

okay
yeah then we can
yeah yeah that user friendly or
mm
yeah
yeah
and we just stick with two batteries so it's not any solar or yeah yeah j yeah because
yeah


yeah
yeah we're done
yep
mm hmm

thanks don't be sarcastic mark
uh rama
ah
mm hmm
what is a double curved shape
uh huh


the cost
mm like this
mm hmm
speech
l c d 
seems not it's either l c d  or push button
ah
the l c d  would
the display would only be display and not uh touch sensitive you mean just uh for output yeah
yeah
i guess no um so the batteries uh are going to be very light
okay
so this device on n that can be used for speech recognition could also be used for just uh the finding it basically instead of clapping why not just be ask
mm hmm
okay

no it's okay puts less of constraint on what we can do but
it's always like that we have dreams and the in the end we find out that it's not feasible
anyway
yeah
l c d  l s d  is something else and it's quite nice as well
so go on uh artist
hmm

let's change millenniums
doesn't make sense this is very ugly
oh no too much concept
ah
ah back today


do you think it can come in several colours
or did the
um but not the case
uh the case would only be in that uh aluminium uh titanium stuff like
yeah well they like uh something which is uh
mm yeah okay so that would be the option i don't know i don't have a nokia phone but
i don't use that but again uh i might
yeah bu but
mm hmm
kind of upgradable uh remote control wow wow
mm
like a chameleon
mm hmm
because uh i think there are two kinds of people those for which the remote control is uh
is to be uh something useful uh i'm going to talk about this later but and those for which
is something that that that uh is uh specific to them so it
it's like a signature my remote control is pink nobody else than me has a pink remote
control and that makes me special

i think i think they would be ready p ready to pay more for that
those who wanted to have it pink
no mm no
it might be optional yeah
the the young people the young people want to be different from their friends although similar but have something just slightly better pink
mm yeah
yeah yeah you always have your remote oh you don't yeah you don't have your remo
wh you you know like for instance take the ipod it's a kind of remote control uh it's white and
it's so white that you see it from any anywhere it has this distinctive look and feel
and look which people seems to like just because it's
a colour that we don't usually see in a remote control white
seems important
mm glow in the dark so


okay
yeah uh huh yeah sure

well so i heard that uh it seems that speech recognition is something that can be done uh so
that's the smartness of the thing currently we don't have guns with speech recognition or uh
beer cans with speech recognition but we may have remote controls with speech recognition
i dunno

don't touch the remote but yeah are are you saying here that uh the remote controls should
be aware of who is using it so for instance the young guy would not
be able to use it because his father doesn't want like with some
maybe fingerprint recognition or
mm
um
mm
okay
so it could be
smart in that way
but for instance th i i'm thinking about the other uh uh particularity that the
the remote control could have s since it it knows who is using it it might also record
the kind of uh channels you are u more often using and uh levels of volumes that you're more often uh
things like that and provide you ways of using them i dunno somehow i dunno that
might be expensive but
that might also be a good sales pitch again the remote that knows you
my turn

okay it's alright
four i think trend yeah
no uh yes
okay so i'm going to talk about trends and um i hope this can help us to
to understand l how we should design our remote control so next slide please
so first maybe just a small recap on how how do we watch trends so it's not so
uh simple you might think that it's easy but uh it's not so simple anyway these days uh the
best uh source of information is the web as you know so have to
to go often on the web and look at uh what the others are doing and ask real people
who are using real remote controls every day uh or any other tool that is similar
to a remote control which basically is a small device that people have with them always like
a phone we can we can use the phone as a as a good uh uh
example of where to in be inspired
of course those tha d who are watching the trends are also have also to be inspired because in fact they're not only
watching the trends they're inventing it they're creating the trend i hope i'm going to
try to help you on that this is more risky because you're not following the trend you try to invent it
which means either you succeed and you make a lot of money or you don't and you're out of business
so anyway uh next slide please
uh to be to be quick there's a lot of words here but uh basically there are uh in in
the market of of remote controls there are three aspects that we should very pay
much attention to the first one which seems to be the most important one is that it has to be fancy
it has to have a fancy look and feel and uh interestingly this is the very most important thing it
has to be fancy
strangely enough it's more important to be fancy than to be wi and now that's the second thing it has to be
it has to be technologically i innovative it has to be new with some of uh new
uh technology inside and uh and this is also uh more important than the
last thing which we w may think that would have been the most important which is that it should be easy to use and
it should be easy to use as a remote control so as you see uh it first have
to be very nice s something that people are proud of uh uh that i uh
they can be id identified with uh and and then uh
something that um contains very novel stuff that they can talk about with their friends huh mine
has this and not yours
and finally of course it has to be useful as a remote control but it seems that it's not so important that it's useful as a remote control next slide please
uh and now in a more uh general uh uh broad way
of seeing th uh the thing if we look back and not uh look at only remote controls i think it's important
to see that the trends are quite the same in many areas so currently the the trends
that we see in l in l big cities like paris and milan well it seems that this year
things should have uh a fruit and vegetable uh way of of look
or feel or so and i think
of course uh i it applies to everything that's the thing with trends it it can travel f from
clothe to furniture same idea fruit and vegetable think fruit and vegetable
and uh if we co we compare to last year now it has to be spongy yeah
well this so so i think uh uh i
when we were talking about rubber i think uh the rubber aspect might be important because it's what is probably more feasible in terms of sponginess
seems not seems not
yeah
so
think more of uh something in the colours of uh like fruit and vegetables and spongy as a even in the shape it has to be more round and uh
more uh uh look natural somehow i mean
and not those futuristic uh remote control with angles and uh and titanium like
so that's what people seem to yeah i i know it's quite far from what you thought but that's that's fashion and
okay that's all i have to say
these i'm sorry
yeah yeah we have people uh uh listening to the trends everywhere in the world of course as you
know our company is quite big and uh so i'm just asking them what are the current trends according to them when they go
in the stores and when they ask uh their uh friends that are
also well
no it's not it's not this this is very general yeah but it seems that trends travel across things the what we
sure yeah we have to i think we have to have the look of fruit and vegetables
but we still have to put our chips inside so of course this is your problem
this is not mine
yeah i think in the colours and in the uh the kind of material if if it's something like rubber made or i think it it's also going to be good
okay
yep thanks
mm hmm
okay
thanks
spongy
no we don't have to but seems it's the trend again as i said we can also try to make it to create the trend so there's no
well that's you t can try to convince us
okay that's a good idea i

uh
i think i yeah i it's again in this uh what i said first it has to be fancy so i think if nobody
else pro provides currently a remote control with that kind of stuff and if we can provide
it i think it's a good sell for us because we have it and others don't it's fancy
whether it's useful or not doesn't seem to be very important

maybe you could explore the two option
mm seems to be
if you have time
for creation

you can paint it afterward no problem we have a very large department of paint you will do it
yeah
the thing is that uh if we want to have as he says if we want to have uh a small number of buttons we need to have a kind of output that says currently what their actions are
yeah
that's the converse to having zillions of button where each button does only one thing
yeah classical we stay classical in that we don't reinvent uh the wheel
anyway it's very in general i think people uh change t v  more often than batteries of their remote control
so because the trend goes faster than the life of the
so it's very
okay
we're done
okay good afternoon hope you have good lunch
oh nice
and you

okay so today is um
our third meeting it will be about the conceptual design uh if i come back to uh the minutes of the last meetings
um we decided not to go for speech recognition technologies because of some reasons and we
are not decided about u the use of l c d  screen on on the remote control because of costs
so maybe we cou wi will be able to clarify this this question to today uh at the end
of the meeting we should take decision on that point
so i hope uh that your respective pr presentations uh will help us so each of you have some presentatio presentation to perform um who starts
so marketing
so you are you saved your y your presentation somewhere
so you're four
which is trend watch
okay mr marketing experts
so
mm hmm
next slide yeah
okay
mm


drawings of bananas
uh huh
well so this is in the next slide certainly
it's not

so maybe you maybe you can display a banana on the l c d 

apple for channel one
okay
that's a question
maybe too long

a banana
okay
yeah and you you you will not have pla enough a lot of place to put a l c d  on a banana also
well you're the marketing expert you should tell us if it is too much or not

so
so you you you suggest to go f
okay
s so you're simply you're simply looking s to a remote control that looks like a banana with few buttons with only a few buttons
okay good so maybe you can go ahead
okay
thanks um
okay i'll give the floor
so you are user interface guy
so you're three
and it's this one
go for it
i there's something that i
unclear really understanding is this a technology that recognize keywords speech keywords
and it's just to it's just to playback something
yeah yeah so this is not s really to do to to do control
yeah this is just more like a poi pois yeah
yeah yeah
so it it's c uh it it it is a uh uh easy uh a fancy thing that you you can bring to we can bring to the
remote control that will not have any uh yeah comp completely
pointless for the inter for from the interaction point of v point of view
okay
yeah yeah so this is so this is this is much more than tak taking this technology bringing
it to the remote control and using it so this is out of discussion
so if if if it is something that you can we can bring easily and to put it into the banana remote control
no this is mm banana bando yeah uh then it could be cool yeah

okay
okay
it doesn't look like a banana at all
yeah
but you you can fit i you're saying now you can fit it to
yeah
mm
it's enough
switch on yeah
okay so i it looks like we're going completely to forget about the l c d  thing
i think that
no we can we can't use that
we can't use that to
to comman co communicate it's just a thing
no
yeah
yeah a good good good thing you want to g to move to your slides you're finished
yeah i think so
mm hmm
mm
exactly yeah
oh good idea very good okay let's move on
so you're two
okay
mm hmm
yeah


yeah
mm but i but there is no elasticity which could be
yeah but the components inside
yeah
very too expensive to do
and also uh
yeah but it's more easier to do a banana in plastic than uh in wood
well it look like it looks like you are all targeting that yeah
yes it is
yeah pumpkin
green um um um yes i see
pep pepperoni
poivron
uh pepper
but um they do d
yeah
yeah
it's not re it you you think it's really fancy and fun you think that young people that are
yeah more than a banana
yeah
it's kind it's kind of it's more uh it's really ergonomic it's fit in the hand
and you've a lot of surface to to put the controls
okay let's move on so time is running let's move on
okay
s objects
crazy objects

okay
okay good
bu it's it's you s you you thing
yeah
mm hmm

you think that yellow it's kitsch
if you make something that looks like a banana it should have the colour of a banana
o otherwise
roughly

yeah
okay let's move on uh uh yeah before before st before ending the meeting i'd like to to draw some sketch about the pro future prot prototype go for it
well no not not you you can finish your slides before
mm okay
okay that's all okay so mm so well done for the presentations so we
need to take some de decisions about um about what we're going to do so
i i propose that you go to the whiteboard and we're going to report
all the ideas we had we had during this these presentations just to draw some sketch
about what will be the prod final product and uh where superman go banana and
uh uh extra func functionalities such as wheels
um the speaker unit um well not in order not to lost the um
the device i do i don't remember you call it
basis station yeah uh so um so we're going for a stylish
banana shape
yeah right
we
i if it i if it has really the model shape of a bana you could the the starting is good but it could
it should have more the shape of a banana if you want to point really a at the thing if you don't want to to to do that movement
which is which is difficult if you don't have to do it in fact it's better
so ti time is running we have to we have to we have to to move forward so let's skip to uh this
uh this this this idea yeah
so we have this we have a a basis um how do you call it
a base station we'll have a base station extra uh on the side
yeah uh we have a r f  for um
for beeping for beeping we need b r f  to beep so we that
means we need a button on th on the on the basis
basis station thank you

can you go quickly please okay so we are going to add uh also um you as you suggested the whee some wheels to control the volumes and channels and your tur turbo turbo uh button
yeah on the th yeah maybe here and the and the wheel a a at the level of the thumb for instance
and and you have two wheels
okay right
good
so no l c d 
okay great um
very good
yeah
oh just the switch no f not for the t v  for the t v  uh so you
on the side
twenty five
yeah
so well no time is running we have to close the meeting in a few minutes so okay the next step you can come back to your seat the next step is to go for to f is to go to uh
to building a prototype based on this okay so next meeting
you guys have to prepare the followi things you have to uh work on the look and feel uh design
and you have to work on the user interface in fact you two you have to work together to model the first uh
f first prototype
uh marketing expert uh have to go to product evaluation
okay
it's too difficult
it's not a possi it will not be possible to implement it for the next prototype so t it's in the next prototype so let's skip it
yeah maybe for the n if if if it it works well we'll go for uh an orange one yeah yeah honour the fruit
okay thanks very much we'll see n next meeting bye
thank you
hi
uh yes i had something similar
but non vegetarian
yeah


what what do you mean by fruit and vegetables and spongy what you mean clothe
no i missed that one

oh they're okay so they're not like dressed as a carrot they just have like pictures of fruit on okay so we're not gonna have a remote control in the shape of of a banana just maybe


okay and

so which fruit are you thinking of
oh so you want the remote control to be the shape of a fruit or you want just some kind of like fruit logo on the
so something that looks half like a fruit and half like an elephant
but okay i'm not i'm not really sure
if uh that would really appeal to everyone though maybe just to fashion gurus like maybe just like a little bit n a little fruit picture somewhere in the corner but i don't know about uh i dunno how ergonomic a an orange is
to fruit
but is it uh is fruit cool
is fruit cool
well i guess you know apple has the ipod so imagi just 'cause they have an apple on their
on their product doesn't mean fruit is cool
okay but it has to be easy to uh to use though and to hold you know you don't wanna pear or a watermelon
well probably the only thing is a banana that i can think of a cucumber
i dunno
maybe too green
so but i mean you also have to you have to also have fit r all the buttons and you know
it's it
the thing is you have t normally with um with buttons they have to be at some point attached to a circuit board so if you're gonna have things like on a cylindrical kind of device it may be difficult to kind of to build
yeah
well this is
okay
yeah
yep
yep okay so
s next uh slide
okay so i received an email um around lunchtime
letting me know that the brilliant minds at our technology division had developed an integrated programmable sample sensor sample
speaker unit um which is a way for you to have a conversation with your coffee machine
and or remote control
it's no what it is it's it's very
it has a has a microphone has a speaker it's got a little chip and it allows you t
well it's a sample sensor sample speaker
sample sensor sample speaker it means that it can recognize it can do like a match on a on a certain
phrase that you speak and then can play back a phrase in response to that but uh there's no
kind of um understanding of the phrase so i mean you know i guess you could build that in
you could you could link the the recognition of a certain phrase to some function on on the remote control but basically
the thing is we have this technology available
in house so um but the thing is obviously there's still gonna be a cost if you decided to integrate
that because you still have to pay for the c production of the components so um it it but it basically means
we c we can kind of consider this from uh you know uh a theoretical or usability kind of viewpoint without
worrying too much about you know how to develop it because we have this already done
whilst you know some people might get annoyed if we uh if we just dump it
it's it it's no well it's it'll recognize uh i guess keywords but you know keywords
in a certain order like a phrase you train it for a certain uh for a certain phrase you say the
the example they said that they have uh up and running with their prototype is um well they've actually integrated into the into
the the coffee machine that uh that we're producing is you can say good morning to the coffee machine and it can
recognize that phrase and it'll playback good morning how would you like your coffee
yeah so actually that was a bad example 'cause it doesn't actually ask how do you want your coffee because it can't really understand the response so
only like only in the sense that it it can recognize a set a set target kind of word an
it's designed it's designed as a fun kind of thing but i guess you could use it as uh as a way to implement uh
completely pointless yeah
yeah
yeah unless you know you like having conversation with your remote control

well yeah that's the thing if you can but you have to pro though i think it's a fairly simple
design so you would have to record into the device every possible combination you have to s tr
train it to l to learn channel fifteen that whole thing not just the word channel and the word fifteen it doesn't have that kind of logic in
it so
yeah that would be some development work
yeah
banana mando banana man

i uh i i i don't think it's worth it though i think it doesn't really add much to the functional
design and it's it's it's not mature enough
to use as a speech recognition engine so
um yeah so if we can just move on to the next slide i've just done a quick mock up of uh uh some of the features of our potential funky looking uh remote control
well you see i was i was unaware at this point of th of the fruit focus um so at the moment it's more of a box focus
yeah well this is actu this could be a genetically engineered fruit that's designed to be you know square so that it packs tighter in the boxes
but um i've just indicated here we could have actually two scroll wheels 'cause i think the scroll wheel is a fairly um key part of you know i think everyone has has agreed that it's that it could be quite a useful um thing so
but i think it's important you know to have two scroll wheels because you know you want one for for the channel but you also
want one for for the volume because it's it's the volume i it's you know it's very handy for it to have uh instant kind of uh
feedback uh and response so
but um i've also included this turbo button because i think you know every design should have a turbo button
and well so this is you know a unique problem with with televisions is that if you have this scro this scroll
wheel for the television the uh the tuner on the t v  is not gonna be able to to switch between stations
as fast as you can scroll so you know the th the person might want to have a uh
might want to be able to scroll past television stations without seeing what's on them in which case it just waits
until you stop scrolling and then you know displays that station or they might want to scroll and
and have a quick glimpse of it even if it lags behind what they're doing
yeah so with this turbo button you can say skip over t channels if uh you know if i'm if
i'm going if i'm scrolling past them and you know it's um you could have a little red light that comes up when they press
it so they feel you know it's really going fast or whatever
so yeah that's um those are the two important uh features i think we need on the remote but i mean we can discuss about what other kind of buttons we need um
you know i it could be you know if we if we wanna have like a very cheap kind of device i mean we could either consider that maybe we want to sell this as a very if it's gonna be a banana you know that's a pretty gimmicky kind of
thing that doesn't have that much functionality it's just you know a couple of scroll wheels and a button cause it's hard to get so many buttons on a
banana and it's still very it may even be for most for some people more functional than their current remote but if they have these scroll
wheels so um you know what other buttons do we want
i mean we could have well i guess you need an on and off switch but you could you could o you could turn it turn it on by taking the top off the banana maybe you know it's kind of like a spy kind of flick thing
that's why you're a marketing guru
well that's the thing as have we decided that we can only spend uh twenty five euro
well not spend but you know charge twenty five euro
but then you have to have a template for every channel for a hundred channels you have to be able to to recognize
mm
well i f i think it's probably more than than our can handle because it's designed for a coffee machine you know to say hello in the morning
well that's its current application i would presume that it's kind of they wouldn't design it to handle a hundred things th so
but uh
well i just i just made the point i don't i don't know if that speech recognition is you know even if we can do it i think it's not really appropriate for uh television environment
but um i did have one thing from a previous meeting you were talking about um being able to find the
remote control and i was talking about extendin being able to extend the remote control by having you know a base station that can control
other things as well it might be useful to have some kind of base station even if it's just you press on a button on it and
uh and the remote control starts beeping you know this is a way of finding the remote
y in that case maybe the maybe the speech recognition the speech thing could be useful just to say i'm here but uh it's probably a bit of overkill if you could just have a a beeping
it's speech
it's it's speech synthesis and s it's speech kind of not really speech recognition but kind of pattern matching yeah yeah
i guess that fits in with the spongy kind of design philosophy
so just one second when you say double curve what do you actually mean you reckon you could like draw us a thing on the on the whiteboard 'cause i'm not sure
okay but like kind of convex or concave
mm hmm okay
okay
although you know wood
could be uh quite a stylish uh option if you take like nice quality kind of wood that's got a nice grain and you kind of put some some varnish on
well it depends i mean you have the outs the wood itself is not gonna break so you don't have to worry too much about the case being broken it's the inside yeah but inside you know you could have you can still have some kind of cushioning that's not visible to the to the user
and i mean you could also you can have just a very thin veneer of wood as well
that's true but are we set on the banana
idea

it's like a pumpkin or
green
what does it taste like
ah yeah is it what's it in french
yeah okay so capsicum or pepper yeah
i don't know it seems a little bit kind of bulky to me like
like with a banana you can have
well
but like a banana you can you can be holding like this and have the scroll wheel kind of on top and just
roll it back and forth like that but with uh i don't know how you would hold a capsicum and

so is that when you say speaker support you mean it just has some output pinned which which which kind of
okay but the speaker is actually attached to the to the chip in some way or is just the the signal okay
okay
so are there any issues where we place this this chip to make sure you can actually hear the the speaker from the outside of the banana
okay
yeah but the speaker if the speaker is actually on the chip then if it's too far away from the the casing or if the casing is too thick then you may not hear the the speaker
yeah
yeah so that's something we have to keep in mind with the actual physical design is to keep the the speaker close enough to the outside
although if
it depends if we like if we are concentrating on like a fruit design then maybe maybe
we wanna sell a collection of fruit you know like a different fruit for each device cause that you know that sometimes
people like to collect um you know things that of a similar type
well you're the one who wanted to do fruit in the first place
like a power fruit

yeah
well
i think that's a pretty handy feature
i think it's kind of people would find that worth it even if it wasn't uh a recharging station even if they didn't have to buy extra batteries you know
so

although you do need to include r f  kind of circuitry in the remote
okay i'm just wondering actually 'cause you know i this whole fruit thing with the banana
it's um it seemed like it first seems a bit kind of uh niche like only a few people would
really want a banana but what if it was kind of uh a stylised banana you know rather than having it
kind of you know yellow and really looking exactly like a banana you could make it kind of silver
and um you know to give you kind of the idea of a banana but without it looking you know completely
kitsch for better want of a better word you know
well you know i don i don't know how many peop
well they
yeah like this colour this colour
maybe you know maybe like still in the shape of a banana
no exactly exactly um but you know just maybe maybe
not exactly the same texture as a banana and just kind of you know because the thing is it's gonna be a little
bit difficult to make um to give like the texture of a banana anyway and to k to have the exact shape
i think if you're gonna not be able to do it properly you may as well do it in a stylised way that just looks a bit more kind of
you know twenty first century rather than sixties or seventies
okay

yeah
okay

yeah so i guess you wanna hold like the way the end of the banana you wanna kind of hold as ma you maybe wanna kinda hold like a gun rather than 'cause you don't want it to point kind of towards the floor
so
you know so if you have like
okay so
so
okay so i guess we need you know something that can fit a banana
shaped object
okay so it's uh
yeah
alright so we need uh okay
yeah
yeah
yeah which i think it's it's probably best actually on the on the underneath of the the device so you have
yes
yeah so you have the thumb kind of here so yeah you need one one here and one on on the other side so you got volume an and channel and uh
no l c d 
oh we need a we need a power um on off switch as well
yeah
yeah
where
okay
well i dunno if the traditional user is gonna buy a a banana remote
in the first place you know
y i mean you need to kind of keep it um
yeah how many of these did we wanna sell i can't remember what was
yeah but how many units did we need to to sell
four point four million
that's a lot of fruit

okay
okay
okay

uh
that can be the t
that can be like the turbo banana plus plus commando

okay yep we have to go design the prototype
afternoon yeah we had falafel



mm hmm
spongy means it it's like sp


but what's your suggestion how we can have some shape like that on the remote

mm hmm
means buttons are in the shape of fruits buttons are in the frape shape of fruits or something apple banana something like that

mm hmm
mm hmm
that we can discuss afterwards
banana
mm hmm
i don't th it will be rolling a lot
but it's just a speaker right
it's not a microphone
mm hmm actually i'm not reading microphone there so that's why you can all have conversation it just to speak to you
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm mm hmm
okay
mm hmm mm hmm mm hmm
in house
mm hmm
mm hmm mm hmm
mm hmm mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah okay let's go ahead
stable thing that's right to have mm hmm mm hmm
mm hmm mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm

communicate
it's one way
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah that's right yeah

so it's a speech synthesis kind of thing something has been uh stored and it's just uh spoken out
mm hmm
yeah that's right
that's right
so this is going to be about the component design so first thing is we need power source for the remote
control so i was of the idea that we can have two kind of power supplies one is the usual batteries
which are there they could be chargeable batteries if there's a basis station kind of thing and on top of that we can have solar
cells when the lighting conditions are good they can be used so it'll be pretty uh innovative kind
then uh we need plastic with some elasticity so that if your if the remote control falls it's not broken directly into pieces there should be some flexibility in t
yeah so there should we should think of something like that and then it should be double curve
the s science for the ease of handling and there are some other issues why we need double curve then controls for the traditionals u traditional users we can have the push buttons so that they don't feel that it's an alien thing for them
double curve is you have curves on both the sides if i'm right
so it's symmetrical kind of thing whatever it is
so it could be curve so it could be convex conve concave depending on what what we want
so there are flats there are single curve and there are double curves these are the three things and there are different materials with plastic you can have double curve but with uh certain other materials we cannot have double curve
so there there was uh there were many other materials like wood titanium and all those things but plastic is i think is the most appropriate one it'll bring the cost down and anyway it's
wooden cases
mm hmm
mm hmm

is it an e apple which has
banana is more handier as compared to this i think and to capsicum
okay so push buttons for the traditional users so that they don't feel they are alienated just and a scroll
button with push technology for channel selection volume control and teletext browsing these are the three scroll buttons which are
already available with us in the company and we we can go ahead with that
yeah we can go to the next slide then uh there are different kind of chips one one is the
basic chip and the regular chip and one an adva advanced chip so we can have regular chip for control pricing is a factor
for us that's why we'll go for the regular chip
and uh regular chip supports speaker support so this functionality could be used for tracing the mobile phone which has been misplaced
it could be a beep kind of thing
yes yes that's right it's it's onto the chip most most probably not not hundred per cent sure about that
that will be the volume control i think which which a user shou it it should be already pre defined it should be whatever will be the case the chip is always going to be sitting inside
mm hmm
uh so we can have it at one of the boundaries so that things are slightly better as or as hearing is concerned we can have some gap at some place so that
that's right
okay yeah so these these were the component selection and these things we can go to the next slide
and uh these were the findings which i i saw with the web web that user wants to have
control more than one device wants to control more than one device from the same remote control so our
t v  remote can have little extra things to support additional devices like v c r  d v d  players which are usually attached with the t v 
because users are like this and they don't want to have one remote control for everything so with this additional
little we might be having slightly better market for us
mm
of fruits
mm hmm remotes objects okay
and uh as well as i could see on the web the scroll button is becoming really uh hot thing s and we should have it on the remote
so you're having a basis station
okay your usually your remote sits on that so you and it's that's why it can have chargeable batteries now let's say
basis station is with the thing
it's like a telephone handset is there and the basis station for the telephone hand set is there so now what user gets additionally he doesn't have to buy batteries they're rechargeable batteries so over the period of cor time he'll recover the cost
so you're having the basis station and there is a button if you press that button wherever the remote it'll start beeping so you know where the remote is uh
mm hmm mm hmm mm hmm mm hmm
uh this is basis station is nothing more just it's a wire which is coming from the main cable and uh you're having one socket on which the thing sits
that's right but all these things are usually in house so we don't have much problems so component cost
is going to be the least anyway we are not using really advanced technology l c d  has already been ruled out a s r  has been
ruled out so it's the basic thing but very trendy and very user friendly
and
mm hmm

a yeah otherwise it'll be mis means you don't get b any feeling then it's neither a banana nor a
and uh going to the last slide
okay
okay okay so anyway users'll be so the findings is users'll be very interested in our locator device to find their misplaced remotes so that was very i thought it's a very good suggestion by everybody that's it yep
mm hmm
that's right the basis station that's right
there's less space on this to put with the buttons
uh what about a
the base station
right
mm hmm yeah
that's right yeah we need that yeah
basis station yeah yeah
turbo button
okay
uh for the remote
remotes don't have power on off switch
okay s no that'll be controlled by the those buttons'll be there already yeah
means on the remote
because remote is going to have both the interfaces scroll as well as buttons they are not going to cost you much everything is in house and now you don't want the traditional users to be apprehensive of this
oh yeah that's that's another issue which i didn't think of
but you know our targets are very high means fifty million euros is the profit which we want make
twenty five twelve point five is the profit on one
uh forty th four
point point four million
point four million
in the market
mm hmm
for the future prototypes

so meeting's over
okay okay okay thank you
the problem is after all this meeting there is
okay
yep
four yeah
yeah that's me uh well i investigate the preference more d
i investigate deeper the preference of the users uh so the the current investigation
th uh th uh sorry the current
the n
current trends
yeah okay okay
well wha what i found um can you
yeah thank you what i found in order of importance from less to more important is that
people want an easy to use device
after they they want something new technologic technologically speaking
but the most what they what they find more more
interesting more or more important it's uh a fancy look and feel instead of uh instead
of the current
the current trend which was f the functional look and feel so now
more more cool aspect ma more a cooler aspect uh
rather than a device with many functions and many buttons with instead of
i instead of ha of a device which can do many things a device which is
pleasant to to watch to see
uh also
well in in euro in in paris and and milan
the in paris and in paris and milan the the current
trend of uh of clothes furniture and all this
all this fashion it's it's fruit and the the the theme is fruit and vegetables
and also in the in the u s a  the the current the mor the most popular feeling it's it's a spongy
spongy means eponge
so maybe we should we should think in in this direction so

fruit vegetables is the the new have you seen the last exposition of clothes in milan
yeah i i didn't miss an i didn't miss and i saw that the fruit there are many fr pictures of fruits and vegetables in the clothes
no no not not yet not yet
yeah yeah so te textu textures yeah
yeah
vegetable textures and all this kind
uh yeah yeah
uh no no it's not it's
and
um
i ha i haven't thought of any particular fruit but the general aspect of the of the remote control
may may could remind some kind of vegetable some kind of
instead of vegetable some natur mm uh natural object or something
but yeah it it depends on the
yeah maybe the shape the shape
no not n not not too much focus not too much focu not
n not too s not too similar to a fruit because next year the ten the trend the trend will be different
so we shouldn't be at re really attached
to to the trend but
for instance yeah african or as an elephant

well ma maybe we we should further specify what target are we focusing
i think in my opinion we should focus on on young people because they are more open to
new devi new devices and also yeah according to the marketing report
ninety p ninety five percent of young people was
was was able to
to buy a a n a cooler remote control
what
what
yeah uh
is the new trend
of the

no i think we we should think about a a shape with it a device with a shape of some
yeah
don don't you think we can find uh the shape of a fruit which is handy to use
or m
maybe
um
yeah
yeah but i li i like your idea that we shouldn't have a lot of buttons b buttons so
uh do you want a an l c d  with twenty five euros
i think
well according to the to the report people are more interested in in a fa fancy
look and feel and in a technological inno in innovation so
i will give more importance to the look and feel than rather than the
new inputs and also it's i'm not convinced about this l c d  because you need uh internet connection you need more things it's not just buying a new control re remote you need buying control remote buying uh
more things it's not so simple
for instance yeah yeah for for for given an an example yeah
yeah no it's what i already said
yeah but you can u
yeah but the can we use it for saying okay channel fifty channel twenty
m mando
banana mando yeah


looks like a tr look likes a a tro a tropical fruit
yeah

what's a turbo button
it con it controls the speed
yeah so sounds crazy i like crazy ideas
yeah of course
i i think we could use somehow the s coffee machine dialogue interface or so
you we can we can't
yeah but we can say channel twenty five no
it's not a lot one hundred templates it's not
ah it's designed for a cof okay is it design for a coffee machine
okay
yeah maybe you could ask your the you could ask the engineering department if we can
yeah
yeah
actually
i was thinking that the
the shape of a banana is not
it's not really handy
uh i don't know the name o o in english uh
this it's not a fruit it's a vegetable
green
and you put in the salad
um
oui c'est ca
pepper
and it's al it also suits with the double curve for easy of
no i mean in a
i'm sure it's fun
but banana is not so handy i think that's handier

yeah you're right
i think that would be funny at the beginning but after one month you will be tired of be surrounded of fruits
no but i think just one fruit to control everything
a power fr a power m a mando a supermando fruit
actually i i didn't understand very well this trace speaker lost control
so you you have to buy two things the banana and the basis station
yeah
yeah but i'm a bit worried about the budget

yeah
no i i

maybe li like that

what about what about this shape
more or less
yeah but how many buttons do we need
what a
what about

four millions
what about a
i wo what about adding the this word spotting keyword spotting recognition saying volume up volume down
it's too difficult but people like innovation and that's really uh innovative and i don't know if it would cost a lot just a few five words
okay
plus plus okay maybe objective banana
thank you
good morning everybody

so we are asked to
to make uh uh a new remote control for television
and the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and
trendy and of course user user friendly
so people can can use it without any
any problem
i don't know

uh not yet but if you want
do you want do you want me to send you a mail
or
uh
you get email
s
for each for each one
so there are so we have three f yeah we have functional design conceptual design and detail design
so who will be the the responsible for the functional design any any volunteer
you are doing th

okay i'll for industrial design
okay
and and you
norman
and
and
doing the marketing
nothing related here to the

next
i don't know i

about the design or
maybe we'll discuss this later no
mm hmm
what we we have to keep in mind the these characteristics and of course it should not be very costly
so
about the about what
you mean the external or
yeah of g of course

yeah
you won't
i i think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly
s
like s uh you you you say we can use speech
in the hand
yeah
except if if you are far from the t v 
this is it's
mm hmm
mm
yeah we should also optimise the the number of buttons
this is good idea

so we have five minutes to
ah you can y you can you can use it if you so can we
s
you it
yeah if if you you you can if you want you can use th the
or before the before the the design that says
norman
be before before writing you can uh sit and that says what we what we said then after that you can you can use the yeah
okay
yeah
mm
okay so maybe we'll meet in maybe five minutes
and we'll discuss the other other aspects
okay well thank you all
hmm
good morning

mm
b did you send us an email about this

yeah we we received an email about this uh d designs
ah it's okay
yeah you see the email you email the v very no no the first one it's inside
no no the third one
oh you didn't get anything
it's strange
mm i got an email about the dis about the discussion yeah
i dunno from who from the account manager you have received the same email right yeah
yeah
yeah so each of us has a role to do
in each
we already have our role
'kay we can
so there are three kinds of designs that's all
okay alright
yeah yeah
i'm doing the interface
are you using the you are doing the in
ah
okay
mm um working on i
user interface
yes
you see the second mail
yeah it's inside go down
appendix
see there's a role for everybody
even for the marketing
but look at your role your marketing role
yeah that's your role
mm
yes
mm hmm
need to collect information
um
i i'm part of design perhaps
uh what is most important in a
in a remote control
what is the most important function aspect
uh
that's alright
yeah it should be easy to work with
yeah
uh we maybe you can have a speech uh recognition interface you just tell the television i want which channel or or you can say for example um
i want uh to list all the programme tonight y you know instead of
uh remote control it's doing the some searching for you so you don't have to look for the channel you want
just say maybe i just want to press i wanna have a button for all the movies tonight
or a button for all the magazines all the information documentary tonight and then you list a few and i will choose from the list so instead of pressing the channel number i am choosing the programmes directly yeah that's one way of uh making it useful
no because no it's not very a lot th this information exists for example you can get um
you can use uh well for example anything the the idea of using speech to reduce the button but uh and it's more natural yeah
yeah yeah
yeah
yeah
yes possible
yeah but
yeah
yeah yeah but th the main idea i wanted to s i wanted to say is that um
there should be a function instead of choosing the ch t v  channel there's a option you can choose either t v  channels
or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme so it's more powerful
yeah
no
no because you see now all the t v  programmes are available on the webs they they are they are they are available
in x m l  format or whatever the format we don't care we just say that this are some content we just want to retrieve the content
and then classi sort them by the types of programmes some of the websites they already provide this service
so we can just use the service available download it uh to the to this remote
control and then there's there are only six buttons for six categories or sev seven the most there
are only seven buttons so i just choose the category one and you reuse the same button for example to
to choose among the the sorted list the programme you want so you don't have to choose among
hundred channels if you have hundred channels you just have six buttons seven buttons
yeah yeah
yeah
ah yes so
yeah
yeah so you don't have to display here just display on the t v  screen right good idea
okay
i think i think that will be revol revolutionary because all the t v  uh the the remote control
have all numbers lots of buttons and then you dunno what to choose in the end
yeah alright
okay
ah w w we have sometimes to use the white board five minutes
okay
okay
yeah
yeah
yeah but we are designing just remote control
okay
okay do you want to have a conceptual remote control there or you just want to put the function in go on draw something

mm
where is it
ah okay
where where is it here
mm
mm
okay alright so so the most functional des mm the most important function is to
ch choo buttons to choose the content right we agree on that right uh
uh first one is to uh buttons
i or it could be anything with buttons uh to choose
uh content s or channels so we have both the user can choose w which one they want right
by content or by channel choose by contents or by channels so
and then what did we say just now
other than this
okay so technically how the problems that how to do it is to how to get the content
challenge
okay content okay so these we have to work it out so this one of the problem and uh
the main thing
okay alright
alright okay so we are we'll discuss it we will get some information in the next meeting so for now we get uh the funct this is the functional designer that's the first aspect right
we will get information and then we'll come back in
yeah we'll come
alright
alright okay
thank you mis

good morning


well i think we should set the the points to to drive the project and uh



yeah from the account manager
yeah
yeah i think so

i think our uh responsibilities will be assigned when we in our mail we received from the account manager
uh
no i'm doing the interface
yeah i i'm i'm
well maybe we have okay so i industrial design
it was a little confusion about my uh but it's alright
yeah
user
well i think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done and what are your ideas about the
well w we want to have a new re remote control for for t v  distribution i guess
so we have to plan how how it would be developed and uh
how we can make it work

yeah i dunno i
yeah
well i i think that norman and i would think about um the technical points and um we should discuss it in the next meeting or
yeah
well you have to make it work that's the that's the big thing
yeah
we can think about an interface with uh well
yeah yeah
i
i think if you want t to choose uh from a list of programme or or something like that you you may have to to use uh w uh i dunno
yeah
yeah

on the content
yeah yeah it's it's a good idea it's a good idea but i i think that technically it would be um a little bit uh uh more tricky to to achieve this than just to
yeah yeah
well i i i i think that j just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to uh navigate uh through the
well channel programme or contents or in an easy way so
yeah in the dis display on the t v  screen and just uh with the with your remote control would just navigate through the f

yeah yeah so
i think for for the technical points we have to to to check how to gather the data from programme or contents and all this stuff


oh right so
please norman draw uh


okay
yeah by content or by channel it's a good idea
and uh we we have to find a way how to gather information about the contents

yeah
i think i it's not very difficult to to browse by channel but it's a little bit tricky to browse by contents so
i think that's the the things to do and uh to uh
reflect about it and uh
discuss it in the next meeting
okay
thank you everybody
okay
good morning
or you can put it in the shared folder
no i didn't get it
this one no
no

i think it's for your guys to how to design it all the aspects so you need that information
yeah i think assign your uh roles
for each person yeah
uh i'm into marketing yeah nothing much in the project
marketing in this design a design is basically for industrial design and the user interface
yeah this is
yeah that's right first
us user define
there's a trend watching
yeah
i mean working remotes we already have this will be something different from the other remotes remote controls
yeah that's right
i'm a okay
i mean the main uh function of remote control is to have something in the hand and we should be very careful about the size
of the remote control if we are going to add a speech interface i'm not sure with trendy slim size
of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface
for that i think the t v  itself could have it
and i could talk to the t v  television itself i need not have an
i mean we have some or something different technology but
mm hmm yeah
and another interesting idea for this would be to have an light adaptation system depending upon the picture of
so i mean if you're watching a movie and suddenly there is a dark uh some dark scene the lights adapt themself the lighting in the room changes
i mean we have a option in the remote control if we want to have that option you press that button in the remote
oh i'm afraid you forgot to put your lapel
the lapel
yeah that one
just plug it yeah that's right
afternoon guys
it's gonna be
oh
'kay
we may do
i dunno i'm feeling like a big boy
'kay ready to go 'kay so we've got our conceptual design meeting hopefully
we've all got exciting ideas now uh k exciting ideas 'kay so here's our agenda
our agenda um
i'm gonna open i'm gonna talk for a bit about what we're gonna do i'm gonna take some notes we're gonna all do a presentation and then hopefully we're gonna make some decisions now
yep well when i say hopefully we have to so
i'm gonna let you guys talk before we make decisions
and does anyone really want to go first
you p two
what's
components design
your name is name
huh hi name

right
we've all broke a remote control ri um s yeah
you press this and it does th
i dunno who and whatnot
'kay
okay
'kay
mm 'kay
okay so we basically have battery versus cradle here
okay
so we have battery versus cradle
it's actually a novel thing because you could sell it a as a novelty just to be actually serious for a minute here you could
mm
hmm
wood wood would ge would give us a little bit of a marketing niche wouldn't it
nah
okay
hmm
okay
'kay do you get a good grip on the rubber yeah okay
okay
okay
okay
i think it might mean something like that sorta shape because a double curve rather than a yeah that's what
okay


d do we have actually any concept of what the difference is between a simple chip and an advanced chip
okay
okay
yeah that makes sense
so presentation from
i guess design would go best
next
technical functions or interface concept
yeah that's it
yes but it has your name on it


but what if you actually had to press a button to make it recognize so if you pressed it and went up
man yeah
but if it's just one thing with a button that you can just go
up

yeah okay
okay
you guys know your stuff
mm
so we're suggesting doing a sorta scroll wheel thing for the volume
nah
oh okay okay i see
uh okay
okay
'kay
so on to
y functional requirements or trend watching
forty six nineteen fifty seven yep

mm
upper management said yes uh e excuse that that's a bit of spam
it's cool
i'd i'd say though that we if we did make the decision to go with the cradle though the then we have that as well but wi with a similar
mm course
yeah 'cause that's
mm
mm 'kay
so now
so our big questions here really are
cradle or not cradle do we go basic or do we go for features
uh d does anyone really wanna do anything with the scroll wheel or should we ditch that off hand first
oh but that was in your presentation so wh what would you imagine it doing

mm 'kay
yeah
what i understand about scroll wheels is they're they're quite expensive to to make so i d
well i d i like the idea of basically focusing the my personal preference is focusing the p the product on the idea of the uh the case the the uh
dock to put it in to to charge it we can target like environmentally friendly ideas that sorta things it s i m makes it easy to market it's easy to differentiate the product yeah so
and if we we keep the rest in a format that is durable because th th the whole product's gonna need to be more durable th thus because you're not going to be ditching it as often it's gonna need to be more expensive because of the cradle
so if we can market it in terms of that and yeah well
so our big decision then is like how do we do um like we have to decide on the details and we have to decide on well n not exactly the details but d do we have uh
what type of casing i personally like what you were saying about the plastic with the rubber

okay just a very thin sorta sheet for a a grip sorta thing or for
okay
so then if we d d do we want to do anything more basic with the uh
more advanced with the user interface in terms of do we want to go for
um buttons or do we want if we're ditching the scroll wheels do we want to go l c d 
do we want to give do we want to have anything else on it
okay
okay so the question is now i guess we need t to
decide on well y you guys basically have to now go and
figure out the details of this thing so what we need to know in terms of marketing and uh project management are are there any other questions that we need to answer now before you guys can go and build this
what what overall things have we not decided on
i think maybe in terms of marketing is that gonna make enough of a difference to justify the cost
yeah and i guess th th the question th th that you're being asked right now is whether is the
dock enough of a unique feature to be able to go out and sell that a a as a a
very different product or do we really need the scroll wheel as well because the scroll wheel comes at quite a cost
that's gonna n is that gonna need a better chip as well
and it's presumably gonna need a little speaker in it or something like that as well to beep
but i guess a little tiny speaker is gonna be quite cheap it's not gonna need q quality is it it's

makes your living room more fresh as you watch
okay we're doing well for time here um we've got about another ten minutes i think that uh
mm pr my personal preference is out i don't think the cost is justified for a little bit more uniqueness when we already have that and i don't s think it's obvious and natural how it would be used
mm
but then that that surely d depends a little on the t v  because some t v s are quite slow at changing channels from
like so if you've got a scroll wheel and you s you have to scroll scroll it really really slowly just so that you're actually keeping
in pace with the t v 's ability to to change channels or do you have to go through and you wait for it you scroll it a bunch
of times and you wait for it to
mm
uh i see i see that's where you
ah i see i see what you're talking about now okay
yeah if you're just sitting there going
that's kinda cool actually i like that
well not n necessarily you could basically make it so that it'll i mean it's just gonna be sending a signal to the t v  yeah the t v 's ge so if you send about five flip channels if you did that it's gonna flip once if you do that
other than click click click
yeah
and if we're marketing it as a high niche product then we're gonna be selling it to people who are buying good t v s as well yeah presumably
primarily
mm hmm
mm hmm
oh i see so if maybe if we had an l c d  up the top that just did a number on it right
and then it that basically
mm
well that's quite cool you'd need a display on the th the thing
oh yeah yeah no i see what you're talking about yeah that's kinda cool how would you program it though
okay okay
okay and yeah and that just basically flips between it and it'll go it sends out zero five and then thirty six and then zero one again yeah that's kinda cool i like that
that's not gonna be too expensive because that's gonna be you're gonna be able to nab that off of computer mouse manufacturers really you could basically come up with a partnership to be able to produce that quite cheaply
might be but tha that's not gonna be such a costly feature the problem we're gonna have is making it robust
making it last
so if there's a button for each type
yeah people are gonna have their favourite sorta whether they do that or whether they
yeah yeah the mode switch
just the lights behind the buttons you could have back lit buttons maybe
would that work is that okay we have five minutes so right details th that we've talked about here are that we want a scroll wheel
we want a mode indicator
we want back lit buttons
and if we're making back lit buttons period do we want that just for the mode indicator or maybe to indicate what button you're pressing at the time so that you know if it's actually pressed or not i've seen some remotes do that
i think we are yeah
yeah well we don't have it's not that we have more money we can push up the the price yeah
'kay
yeah
so we really need to be sure as to what we can push the cost up to though we haven't got to a stage where we're ready to pin down the price of components but i'd say what sorta price are we looking to be able to sell something like that and what sorta price can we make it for
yeah no i i think that's where we really should be more flexible than anything else because as we said in the last meeting our management is really looking
for us to push our brand we're entering a new market here so i think the the profit expectation for this one product is
maybe not as important as being able to
but th what's our ballpark as to what we'd be able to sell something like this for
but you've gotta think who our target market is because i i'm not our target market i'm a student but
on the other hand i would think
mm with my project manager salary i would think yeah i could probably afford this uh
would i buy it maybe if i had a cool new t v  and this was r looking really slick and it had the dock and it had the scroll wheel which
i think's a really cool idea that would sell me on it a little then maybe you know i do i don't
think i'd go over a hundred euro certainly that would be way too much but the i would be happy paying
over forty for it i guess but not much
'kay thirty five to fifty euros is our sales bracket okay so the question is what we ca we make it for
mm
that's why the scroll needs to be really robust
yep
okay the next meeting starts in thirty minutes although does it it starts at three twenty one the next meeting so we've got more than a thirty minutes um we've got more like fifty
the the ne next meeting is three twenty one yeah
yeah that is uh they've they've changed the times from the presentations
okay so you guys will be getting your modelling done now and uh
okay are there any other questions with regards to what this thing's gonna do look like how it's gonna work that need to be addressed before we really look at this in a lot of detail
okay
okay this one was quite easy
always the optimist 'kay thanks guys
alright well we got some exciting stuff for you guys
or not
all ready
we do
alright
i guess i'll go first
yeah
component i think yeah
yep that's it
my name is
my name is name
sorry i did this in a bit of a rush
so so here's a look inside your really old looking remote control um you've got
a printed a printed uh circuit board here and you've got all these buttons which kinda press down little rubber
nubbies into these little holes that activate
yeah we've all broken a remote control so you've also got um you've got your chip here your batteries here and some sorta electronics um
well so you've got here's here's a transistor and this amplifies your signal
um you've got the l e d  here on the end of the uh uh on the end of the printed circuit board um you've got
a couple diodes here for i don't know who and whatnot
so exactly so um we've got a i in this in this uh drawing he uh
in this example here this is a eighteen pin um uh chip
i dunno uh it's two double a  batteries this is pretty standard remote
so here are options for our power sources you can use a basic battery which we've already discussed
um th our tech department also said we have the option of doing some kind of hand dynamo where maybe you crank
it or something like that i don't know if that's really i don't know we got some qu crazy
guys down there in that department so
you shake it
yeah so that's the next bullet is the um the kinetic provision of energy so
it's like that flashlight where you have to shake it uh we've got solar cells which i don't think is a very
good idea because um you could not use your remote at night which doesn't make a lot of sense
and finally we've got our cradle o our power cradle idea
m battery versus cradle i think is yeah
it could be fun
yeah well it is it is more uh i mean it is more eco friendly than the than the cradle 'cause you're still using power off the grid with the cradle so um
our case design we have uh choices in materials and choices in the general shapes that we can do
our material choices are a plastic latex um ty or plastic a rubber
latex type thing uh wood or titanium if we go with titanium we're gonna be uh limited
in the amount of shapes we can do because it's tough to shape the titanium and uh
yeah pers
i think wood i i i can't see anybody wanting to use a wooden remote it's just anti technology really you know
right and what we may be able to do and i think this might be the best option is to combine some a couple
of these um my recommendation personally would be to do some kind of a plastic inner shell with
a like a rubber outer shell to make it um to mak uh like a thick plastic inner
shell and a t um kind of a to have that rubber outer shell to make it more durable
and also maybe i i think it feels a little better than the plastic
yeah um
yeah
the advantages of working with plastic and rubber is w we we'll have a lot more um options just in terms of shape because
you can extrude plastic in basically any shape you want so um and then we can cover you know
the breakable bits with rubber yeah so um
but basically these are curved and double curved i i believe that the tech department in their um
in their message to me that they were referring to the number of th curves in the bottom
i have no idea exactly what they're talking about but that's what they told me uncurved flat curved or double curved
i would guess this like this pen would be kinda like a double curved where it's curved on m m multiple axes right i think curved means just curved in one axis and double curved is curved in two axes
or surfaces i have no idea
oh okay oh like a wave okay alright that makes sense okay um okay
with the interface we have the following options we can u we can use push buttons we can use a scroll wheel with
an integrated push button and l c d  display or multiple scrolling wheels
um so these are all options that the user interface guy can uh has at his disposal to put together a user interface
for electronics we have these very technical um descriptions here a simple
chip which is the least expensive but i have no numbers to give you a regular chip which is like
the medium porridge the medium expense uh
yes the difference is with a simple chip a simple chip will operate oh why doesn't this scroll up
previous previous okay a simple chip is required to operate push buttons um
an advanced chip is required to to operate um the l c d  display and it
didn't say specifically but i i have a hunch that a regular chip is gonna be the scroll wheel
and the multiple scroll wheels
so but yeah
that's the end of my presentation
i think


no

if the t v  is working yeah that's just i mean it'll if somebody says up in the middle of a
television show it's gonna change the channel
so
well then why don't you just press the up button
even still there's gonna be interf th there's there still will be interference from the t v  it might not be it might not be completely confusing but i think you'll still y it's still i don't think it's practical at all i think it's a bad idea frankly
that i would believe

mm hmm
that's not a scroll wheel
right
instead of play stop rewind and fast forward there that's up down louder and quieter
trend watching has a later date there
are you talking about the picture that's not our that's not our b design that's just a that's just something he a a graphic he used to show you the layout of what the layout of the buttons might be like
what's special and unique about a scroll
well right i think the two big th points that we have so far are the having the cradle
and also having uh the um the actual design of the
uh case itself having like this like rubber shell maybe with a plastic interior having it look
really nice um and also be really durable
right yeah yeah
well let's get a product then
well my question is what would the scroll wheel do
function wise what does that do that
yeah well it's it's just another way to do the exact same thing that the buttons do
yeah
th they are gonna be more expensive but on the other hand i mean it
i mean it is an alternative if if you think that's gonna sell some some uh
you know if if we're gonna make up the extra cost by extra sales i think maybe it's worth it to
do it but i mean i would just use if i was gonna do this i would just use the scroll wheel for s channels up
and channels down
i don't think volume or do you think volume would be
no we can we can do multiple scroll wheels but
mm hmm
yeah
mm hmm i'm thinking yeah something like kinda almost like these pens you know where there's you have plastic bits and then it's not really rubber but just kinda like a fused the plastic with rubber on the outside
well no ma yeah maybe a bit more then th is on here but ju just as a kind of an inspiration these pens i think are are kind of
or from from my perspective i think l c d  is a mistake because this is a universal remote
and all you're doing i mean it's you're not gonna get any information back from the television so the only information you can
display on this remote is what channel you just sent it at last and there's just not a lot of information
you know there it receives no information
so i i don't see any reason for having an l c d  'cause it's an increased cost unless you can think of something interesting to do with it
right
well we have to i think for me it's still not exactly clear exactly what the inter user interface is gonna be there's the scroll wheel in or out
what do you guys like in the user interface
well i dunno about like the flip phone idea because i think as far as durability th it's not a big well maybe when it's closed
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah
well
the
the locator's gonna require a radio transmitter which will
um we're probably gonna have to go with a like a medium chip s i would imagine
but we i we will need a receiver an antenna
yeah
it should be a really simple signal though so
that's true yeah
oh yeah yeah it'll be really cheap
so the scroll wheel
in or out
for me i think the scroll wheel actually might not be so bad i don't know exactly what the increased cost is gonna be but i think he
does have a point i it might push somebody over the edge when they're looking at our at our remote versus something else when
they see this one has a scroll wheel to go up and down on the channels i think it might be kinda neat to
be able to do it like that
sure
well i think wh what it would be is like like the m like this where it's maybe you know a digital
wheel right where it's where it's quantized into you know certain
that was that was my my intuition of what the scroll wheel would be
it's just it's basically it it's just a f look and feel thing it has the same exact functionality as two buttons
yeah
now just just so you know though uh you did bring up a point which is very valid is a lot of t v s won't re the t v s won't
respond exactly the same some of them are gonna be kinda slow switching so you may like queue up like fifteen channel
changes and it'll be like flip flip flip
but
right
yeah it just might be frustrating where you can't make it go as fast as you want but i think once people get used to it i i do like the idea of the scroll wheel though

i think i know what you might be getting at or or
well what about this what about if you can programme in your favourite channels into this scroll wheel and you can just like roll through your favourite channels and it c it
why it'll tell you when you flip the channel on the t v 
yeah
well you just it's one extra button you say programme start and then type in 'cause you still have the typing
you know you'll still have the keypad where you can type 'em in manually so programme start zero one enter zero five
enter thirty eight enter programme end
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
oh well we also have to determine in some manner how to switch between modes between going through your favourites list and just hitting up one up two
no because you wanna be able to go up and down through the channels
right
i think we'll need a we'll need a mode switch but then if we have a mode switch we're gonna need some kinda indicator
to which an l e  an l e d  okay
okay
okay just so you know i think i mean it was my understanding that before we were gonna stay in the mid market range it seems we're kind of approaching a higher end range i wanna make sure everybody's okay with that
okay
i just wanna make sure everybody's on board with it so
right
well y yeah let's let's try and think now how much would you pay for with all these features how much would you pay if you went to the store and you were in the market f to replace your t v  remote how much would you pay for that
i'm just asking you
if
then you could probably afford this
oh no no
i would say thirty five to forty
okay
right
with a cradle radio transmitters
and back lit buttons and it's gonna look sexy
or not it might look like clay
probably we'll let you know when we're done if we can go earlier
yeah
i don't think so if we have any questions we'll just email you i guess
think s
mm pro
probably not 'cause he's
's been listening to too much he's getting retarded yay
or not
yeah

apparently i'm old as well


presented by name

my name is inigo montoya you killed my father prepare to die

yeah there's a thingy and a dingy and

nah

i wanna change that



i like the kinetic



oh interface concept
very long presentation
well that doesn't bo bode well for it for it tats as well
um so somehow that thing's too big but um okay um our uh manufacturing division wanted the speech recognition they say they could put it to work but um we don't think so
no it it it you'll be you know be affected by the by the other speech and
yeah and and fighting for the remote would not be fun anymore and i think that's one of the things we wanna keep
that kinda would r d yeah that would kind of lose it
yeah so um taking that away our uh the the the rubber but
rubber buttons are the more reliable it's the the ones that would al would allow us to to
market our product as being you know less prone to damage and more resistant to things like
spillage of liquids over it or you know mistreat misuses
as it happens to remote controls um as for the
point that we making about losing it well we wanna small r remote control one side because uh
we want it to be cool and uh designed but um
apparently um market shows that bigger s bigger um
remotes get less lost about
but um yeah i think we we need to compromise between those two and somehow we'll do that somehow
um so the the what i would propose is something more or less in the uh
direction of what is to yo the right of that slide uh but without with a l a less
complicated um design so the numbers the volume control and channel control and teletext
access uh the volume and channel control can just become those the the four button array
as in if it was a round dial
and um if you just think about it as the one to the right but with the numbers and the four buttons plus maybe a centre one with teletext
ye no it's not i i it's just four buttons that are on a cross so that you ba basically can control all of the important tasks from that alone
yeah um yeah so i think we w we go for something mid sized so something looks good and uh is not too prone to get lost
that be it

but would we
i dunno i'll bet first in volume maybe i dunno
it's only a t v 
hmm
mm hmm
no it's just different
maybe not
s
yeah
yeah i think we have like and it's not very usable and it will bring down the robustness of the whole thing 'cause it's it it breaks down easier
mm hmm
yep

yeah
yeah

okay so we'll come up with something between thirty five and fifty that is rug rubber robust
with scroll wheel with the new facilities of the scroll wheel like favourite stuff favourite
channels and and with a cradle and yeah and the locator

or not
okay so you can market pe depending on that
cool
hmm

yeah i think it pretty much everything's covered
coulda been worse
yes i am
rock and roll
so do we need to re train mike on how to put his mic on
okay can he get it all by himself this time

so
i believe i can fly
just what i needed was something exciting
remember i'm an old man
thirty's really young eh
jose he man is
n name

i've
i just love you tech guys huh they just
yeah y do jabber
p
yeah
i i gotta i gotta flashlight and uh yeah but it's interesting 'cause you shake it like
this like this
and that's on the camera
yeah
i g i i figured you would yes yeah
it it it
uh
uh uh to me in a marketing sense it's not it's not relative we can we can o we can uh accentuate whatever whatever product you put in there we can find a way to accentuate it
and if you make it from that super rubber when you drop it on the floor it can bounce right back up in your hand you don't even need to lean down to get it

mm hmm yeah that's yeah that's what i see yeah that's what i see also
ooh
that's right

mm hmm

i dunno trend watching i guess trend watching i believe
see what it looks like it's been so long
well i don't know what to say when i s when i see the when i see the product i i i
i don't wanna buy it i see so many of 'em out there there's nothing about that product that makes me wanna choose that product over
other products that are out there yeah yeah
okay
okay
okay 'cause 'cause right now i don't have too much to say about how to market this product because we don't have a product to market yet and uh from from talking to mike is that we have we have uh we can market a more expensive product now
that's what i understand so hello
and and so yeah i'm a i'm a little bit stuck right now in that what uh w what is it
that i'm gonna market uh without special or increased marketable features i don't believe the product has
a consumer demand uh i like the idea of of the scroll makin
there are so many people making these products at this price right now what are we gonna do to make this one special and unique
uh well i don't yeah it's i i just see it as different i don't say it's specially mm
i don't say it's special
uh i say that it's different i what i'm looking for as marketing is m give me something different i give me a lower price give me a higher price give me some new technology don't give me the same thing that everybody else is putting out there on the shelf it's f at the same price
i need something to market about this thing we're we're a new firm
what i if when when we have yeah when we when we have something like the cradle or or something give that's as as a marketing standard i need something to market to make this product unique
yep
mm 'kay just remember when i made up this report i didn't have the information that we're discussing here and and so so uh yeah when we have a cradle when we have some kind of design so what i'm saying is from my perspective i don't have a product to market right now
um uh my personal preference is that we make some adjustment in the cost either lower or develop an integrated new technol technology that's that is the next step there's technology and then there is technology which we're moving into the next phase
and so uh we're gonna have some new technology to enhance the marketability yeah uh again i'm not sold on the product because we don't have a product in my opinion yet
so i need a product i need a product to market and i just whatever product you guys put together we'll find a way to market it tha that i'm not concerned with
if you if you give me if you give me a cut out of what everybody else has then i need to i need to find a lower cost
yeah wh wh what's the wh
okay now what i see with the scroll wheel is everybody has buttons so from a marketing standpoint i have i have another
door to walk through when we have something that's unique if it creates something more complex or more expensive
then i don't know if that makes it uh a marketing necessity but again from a marketing perspective
i want as much new and different about this thing as possible because we're we're co it's a very competitive market
mm hmm
yeah yeah i think it's that's right i think so
mm
yep i think we got some exclusivity in that you know we got something that nobody else has right now and and that means we can we can make some adjustments in the retail or wholesale price if we need to and it also can create it's own demand from it's uniqueness
yeah
yeah right now there's right now there's nothing coming out of the t v  to receive so you know unless technology changes and information starts coming out of the a cable box or something there's no s i don't see the
i don't see the necessity of an l c d  either don't see it


again well i think it's it's the more uniqueness you can bring to the product the easier it is
i believe for me to market uh again the push buttons i i see are are everywhere
and so we can go with the same thing but we're gonna be com competing in a in a broader market than if we go with something unique
you know the other thing i thought about was you know do we go to something like this
make a remote that doesn't look like a remote
it's just another it's just a an idea and i don't know
i mean what i see one of the things one of the things you brought up in an earlier presentation is when you got children their their stuff gets inside the circuitry they get dirty they get messy with drinks and stuff this
and what i keep throwing out there i just keep throwing out ideas to try to make this thing look or act or in some way identify itself as unique or different
but you guys are the ones that have to c ultimately create the product within cost
oh okay phew i think you gotta g get into cost effectiveness i
think if you can have the base station with a with a locator i think those are two very strong features
if that's something that can be integrated without a bunch of extra cost
mm hmm
integrated yeah so it's just uh i i think that's

i know personally that would be a very attractive feature is to have a uh have a button i can push to find my remote control
or maybe you can like have a a smell o rama you know you push a button and it s puts out a stink you can

yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah

w
yeah
oh yeah
yeah

i i think there's you know that uh there are so many people today that are that are surfing
are television surfers and i see the scroll as a as a great mechanism for surfing instead of going button to bu
you just j you'd j j j j j j i really i really think that's a really cool thing for surfing
well there's ano
that's right
yeah i think so i i think so now the the only thing i i on the interface side of it is that i i i see the dilemma
but if we have the option of of scrolling at any particular speed or the
option of jumping direct okay so i can go uh presuming
i have on my television something that tells me what channel i'm on i can scroll direct from channel five
to channel thirty two
i know what because it's on the television the television tells me what channel it's on when i change it so
i don't know that really that's that's gonna be a a d problem 'cause the television can go automatically from channel five to channel
thirty two with the push of a button okay so ca can we can we create that kind of interface
within a scroll system you understand what i'm saying
oh no we could read it from the television
yeah the the television can tell you can
put
and then
and again we have another another great marketing tool we have about three we have three or four things here
i dunno and an maybe we maybe even have this as in house technology this may be something that's available through our own uh through our own services
or we go directional up we go we go this we go this we go this way for one we go this way for the other
ah ha okay
okay okay well then you just have you have a diff you have a mode switch


yeah yeah
well you had acknowledged that we have more money for this didn't you say so
that's what i mean we can increase the cost
so i don't know i don't know whether having
well i think th i think the design and technology has to come back and say okay to create this product we see it's gonna cost us this much for this volume because we do have a volume target of of fifty million profit
okay i'm i'm okay with that i guess what i just want to me the next step is for these guys to come come in with the design proposal w with the cost estimate attached and then we have to take this to the next level
we have to find cost
yeah i was gonna say thirty five to fifty
because one of th one of the things we're marketing about this product is that this is the last one you will ever need to buy for your television it's one of the marketing features in this
mm hmm
yeah yeah bas th that's that's easy that's that's not a it's a
'cause we have about six six seven features in that alone
under the title of uniquenesses
well i have
is my three twenty one is the next meeting
that's that's almost uh fifty minutes
you guys can
you guys you guys can uh create a
all kinds of things
thanks yeah
still
thank you
i don't have any emails this means i can go home
oh we all leave
so we come to the third meetings i have
good
um so in the last meeting we have discussed the functional design and now we will talk about the conceptual design
so we
will talk about some
specific details
this

uh this is what we have decided in the last meeting but if we use battery
we will okay
three

what's the function of this button
i think it makes the the interface really
graphical user interface
a graphical user interface emphasise the use of pictures
yeah
mm hmm

we should include speech synthesis in this case no
mm hmm

or maybe we can include the user manual in the in
the remote control and we should have just a button like help and you say
uh and you ik you press the button help and maybe you see the the user m
might in the in the t v 
yeah
on t v  t v  screen so just you push the button and we will
yeah
if the if
no in the case where they need help in the case where they need help
yeah
it's just for user customizable for kids or old people so
so it's the same
can be used by both kids and old people
maybe for kids kids they like uh t no l they like to


yeah
mm hmm
you can use this screen instead of the big se screen instead of use the yeah
hmm
but
yeah


mm it's for it's just for small vocabulary we it's not yeah
yeah
yeah push push
it doesn't mean that the other buttons are not necessary or important
but they are just less used compar yeah
or maybe we can u uh or maybe we can uh make this the ten percent of button more bigger than the others
so
mm
it's
and i think it's increases the cost of the the remote control if you use l c d  i
you will listen to a peep special peep
okay
yeah
but you don't you don't have to move the the charger
you have to keep it
okay
maybe for some people lazy people
yeah yeah
mm
or
or maybe you have to to show some specific programmes for kids and then just just yeah just push uh kids button so it's automatically
so if he
yeah
mm hmm
yeah it's yeah
mm hmm
or just
it's difficult to to just say the the name of the channel it will be difficult to say just
the name of the channel because you have to s t uh a ch yeah but you have to
to have all the name of the channel in your vocabulary
or maybe
or maybe the user can create his own vocabulary just pronouncing the the name of channels and include in the vocabulary
or lets the user create his own vocabulary
of channel
no just you have uh in the beginning you have
uh t you have to train you have to create the vocabulary by yourself by associating each channel with the name or
and for each one has his own
or you have to s
yeah
mm
or we can switch on or switch off the the special yeah
maybe we'll discuss them in next meeting it's time to close this meeting
yeah okay thanks for your collaborations

mm
mm
mm
sorry what is this single curved what does it mean
so it's it's not
yo l yeah when you hold on it it is comfortable to hold
okay
yeah and the battery is it kind of a rechargeable or it doesn't matter
that that's what it means by kinetic
okay
mm hmm
okay
mm
mm
okay
yeah
yeah we we might check with our r  and d  department to see if they have this product ready for market
mm mm wha
ah the department
mm
uh
so i um keep in touch with the r  and d  department


so the titanium case is the normal case that i'll show you some pictures
that i have and you tell me whether they are titanium case or not 'cause i am not very sure plastic
titanium or whatever there's another point i want to make is that the
uh well you've seen them i le na my presentation that um i point out some why buttons are not
the mm
not the only ways you can use
yeah
yeah maybe n

yeah

so the user interface is uh
i it uses the aspect uh of a computer system a programme which can be seen or heard
or otherwise perceived by the human user and the commands and mechanism
the user uses to control its operation and input data so you s this
gives you the ways to input data and we have uh we are more we emphasise more on the graphical user interface
here the idea is to represent buttons as figures diagrams
symbols and on so you you can easily when you look at the symbols you understand what it is doing
yeah yeah so
ea easy to use
so next one function five
so i can use the button the mouse maybe
yeah
so next line so the here are some examples so they cluster the buttons together
they group them into col they colour them and uh they have different forms as well
mm
but this interface are kind of confusing
uh basically there are too many buttons
right next one
so some people are propose voice recognition and
so ah by the way i receive an email from the from one our departments saying that
the voice recognition has been used in the coffee machine for this by a company when you tell the
you say good morning coffee machine and the machine are reply to you so i just got an email saying that
and it seems like this voice recognition technology is ready to be used so we might consider that
supposedly the next one
mm so somebody some people use uh some people use a spinning wheel th with the l c 
display so instead of using the mm buttons you have a l c d  screen and then there
you can u you can use that as buttons you can use that as real
so so that could be an option as well touch screen i mean next one
and some people propose a scroll button
integrated with push buttons or you may have scroll button instead of p just the push button like the one we have here
uh next one
so
mm
so there are a few aspects that i collected here
so s basically this deals with special users children handicapped people
old people and uh
mm and prog basically they are programmable specially for children and uh
mm yeah yeah and then they also secure uh covers to protect
uh secure and hidden programming and battery covers that will protect your settings so
but we don't have to integrate all these complicated features i'm just saying that the currently in the market there
are there are control there are remote controllers f customisable
for different people yeah so that's the point
the next one
and uh you see this is the one where you have the protection cover
mm maybe useful for children they migh you you they only see the buttons outside and for adults
wh where you have more control you can see the one inside so the adults might wanna have a key to lock that to pr
so children will not touch the button inside
yeah
the next one so this guy this is another company that provides big buttons
at i see that that is useful for old people and then you don't get it lost but for our product we
don't need a big one because you have voice recognition e eventually with use and you can
call your remote controller if you don't know where it is t v  remote controller where are you
and then he will beeps and to say that i am here for example
is it possible
uh
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah and uh this is another one where you can uh
the the the part that's a v  standing for the volume so there's a up arrow and a down
arrow but you the see that in the v  the v  appears to be the down arrow on the top on the top
up arrow if you up arrow there's a v  like as as if it's turning down so it's confusing interface
so i wanna avoid this kind of thing in the design
and here are is uh here is a s short summary that i summary that i compiled after the findings i found
big buttons are convenient voice recognition helps push buttons scroll buttons spinning wheels
can be used as navigation tools and uh user customisable is important and finally
simplicity simplicity is the key yeah so we have many concepts
there but we have to choose later on which ones are important to be used
and basically uh
yeah
mm hmm
yeah
mm
mm
okay
a help button so you are display on the screen so on the t v  screen
okay
okay okay so that eliminates all the complicated documentation okay so wi
yeah
mm
mm
well uh what i s propose is that uh you know a remote controller
i it could be a cube is uh a small device that uh looks like a cube
and maybe you can just change the um the buttons if you ch turn one side
you get one one buttons you turn the other side you get the other buttons so for maybe new generation
people who get used to the computer they want lots of controls
small
yeah
let's see the market demand
what what market yes yes
yeah yes
yeah

mm
oh
big screen
yeah
mm yeah
mm the thing
yeah yeah
yeah if you re use the existing screen we element eliminate the l c d  after all the l c d 
just to display and if you have the colourful screen you can make the display colourful fancy
as fancy as the one on the l c d  maybe even better so
yeah
yeah
yeah more on a fancy design
yeah
mm
remember we have a s budget for the cost of producing the remote controller
yeah so i is so the thing is you can find out how much an l c d  will cost and then we'll decide again
uh maybe you can find out the price and tell us next time is i if i
yeah
yeah and also the cost for the speech recognition ask our r  and d  department
yeah
yeah and ho
yeah and also the scroller button how much will it cost
yeah
don't use the buttons
yeah
yeah yeah
yeah
important
yeah
yeah mm
yeah yeah so so the at most more power uh
yep
yeah
mm mm yeah
yeah
mm
mm
mm i if mm mm
yeah
i think that there's no contradiction here because if there are few buttons you don't have to look at your
your controller any more because you know where the buttons are so if you wanna control the screen
d sh sharpness you just say sharpness and then you t turn you just press lef increase or
decrease button and the same for the volume and the channel if
you had the speech recognition there you just shout your channel just tell your channel and then you don't even have to look at the
butto at the controller so finally that wil eliminates the the need for l c d 
with the help of speech recogniser you can yeah
mm
mm mm yeah a and
mm
where yeah
yeah
mm
put it back at the charge yeah
yeah
mm
hmm mm th yeah mm yeah yeah mm
mm there's mm mm
yeah that we can what we can do is we can program a function whereby when you press the switch off t v 
button the off button the remote there be s uh instruction on the screen please charge charge me
you never get it lost because uh every time you're off the computer the t v  you are asked the the command
the t v  com remote controller would tell you to put it back to where to the charger
yeah so you will never get lost yeah
yeah yeah because everything is programmed inside so it's it's uh it's all about strategy y
mm
mm
yeah yeah
with uh two two two parts controller
yeah
mm
mm
mm mm
mm
mm
mm
yeah mm
mm
these are probl yeah
mm mm
mm
mm
mm i think we need to define also a s the set of vocabularies for the speech recogniser
because uh if you want uh say we can sort by channels or sort by
t v  programs you have to decide a category of vocabularies for them
if numbers they're easy but if name the channel by by name
mm
mm
yeah
mm
mm
mm
mm
but i i i think that the user would like wou would like to associate the channel or call the channel rather than than the numbers
you say numbe channel number five of the t v  correspond to something else in the channel so some people may want to say i want to see this channel
yeah check with the v r  and d  department the capability of recogniser uh
well it's convenient for the user
the uh uh mm
mm
i i think that i have mm mm i think there's another way you can do is that
uh you can uh if when the user ch press a button
to choose the channel for example then what you can do is that the you can make the t v  screen to split
them into small little little squares of images where you you you have a snapshot
of every channel so let's say it's a four by four matrix of the images so now what you do is
f looking at the all the sixteen channels available at one time you just use the control button uh you
just you you just choose the the option you want and then you just hit the button and then you go to that channel so
mm
so you you don't use the speech recogniser in that way
oh okay yeah

mm
yeah i wanna watch this i wanna watch that
mm
mm
mm
hmm
well you you stay a five minutes

okay so i think i will do my presentation on the components concept so can you please uh open uh
i'm participant two
components design
okay so uh the first thing uh i have done is to to made a review
together with the uh manufactural uh department and have which components
was uh available to build a remote control so for energy sources we have
we have to choose between the solar energy hand dynamo and uh kinetic um
well uh kinetic uh technique to to store the energy
we also um we also can put a regular battery in the in the remote
control now
yeah b uh f well uh i meant uh by by battery i meant uh
i will not have a uh a wire between the remote control and the energy source
but uh i didn't fou we didn't decide yet which kind of battery
we will put inside the the remote so uh it's a point to discuss
then uh the case material we have uh uh also several choices like wood
rubber titanium or latex but uh well
it's not a a re uh well a real issue for the from the technical uh point of view
concerning the interface uh we can we can put mm just simple buttons or scrolls
or buttons uh much more complicated but it also requires that the chip
to process the button is more complicated so and uh this is the last point
the choice of chips
so what i have f found is that i think basic battery or kinetic
uh energy uh collection is the is the better way to provide energy because
i think solar energy wi won't work in a cluttered uh uh environment
so um so i think we can start with these two main
things for the case uh well uh i think that uh titanium is
um is a good choice because it's trendy and it's uh it's uh well
it's modern and uh user are are are mm
will be uh very happy to have a a a nice remote
for the interface uh i think that we can ach achieve uh all the desired functionalities
by s just uh using uh rubber buttons simple buttons and th thus this allow
to use a regular chip that are uh well cheaper
and s so uh we can move to the next slide yeah
well uh uh i i it's uh it's the the shape of the um of the remote you you will have the well um the the curve will fit into your hand when you grab the
yeah it's more confog f comfortable that if these uh it's completely flat
yeah the um that's the point the kinetic one is uh y you can recharge uh by the um
yeah and by well by just by moving the ar uh your arm the mm
well the remote will uh accumulate energy but i d i don't know it's
if it is feasible because i don't know if yet if if the user will move
enough to provide the remote um all the necessary energy
yeah and yeah and so can you go to the next slide please so and uh that's uh that summarize well what i have said
so uh you're right we can uh see in our uh r  and d  uh if the kinetic metal is sufficient to provide enough energy that's it
oh yeah i take care it's all right
all right yeah

yeah

mm hmm mm mm
yeah fine
yeah
s a good idea

yeah


yeah
yeah but uh as norman say if uh there is uh already a commercial product available who t who do this we we can check uh to integrate it i into our uh new remote control
yeah yeah
hmm
yeah
well i i think you it's it's it's fine you have uh reviewed all
all the possibilities but uh uh well uh i if
we consider that uh the user interface is displayed on the t v  screen
i don't think we nee uh we need much buttons in the remote since we
we just have to navigate and to have a okay or enter key or things like that
because uh adding wheels or scrolls uh makes the thing more complicated and
more expensive also so
yeah that's a good idea to have a help button
yeah
on the t v  screen on the t v  screen the uh how to use your remote
uh yeah
in a marketing point of view
but uh wel well i think

uh well so le le let's see what uh what people want
yeah
yeah
mm the functionalities yeah
yeah
well mm w well i i i don't really see the advantage of having uh l c d  on the on the remote control if we have a a a big screen and uh display on the screen
it's yeah of course it's fancy trendy and so on but it's it's expensive to produce and it's not really
yeah
yeah yeah
yeah but when you play with the ipod you don't have a big screen in front of you s
yeah
yeah yeah yeah
so i th i i well i think we we can focus on the uh on the fancy look on the uh
on the speech recognition if the technology is available but well i think l c d  will uh will uh make us spend a lot of money for not so big results

so price of uh l c d  display and
yeah
yeah okay and
well uh compared to the to s the simpl simpler simplest button
yeah yeah i think that
yeah i i i think that uh well uh as we have seen in the in the presentation uh well uh
about uh uh fifty percent of the of the percent n choose the button so uh
i think to have uh five uh simple button is sufficient for our functionality
yeah but
but the uh the thing is is i is that we can add a functionality on the on the t v  screen like uh a a list of function and then you choose with the with the button to well you navigate and you
yeah
but if i i if we if we could have a a a display uh g a user
interface that is very complete on the t v  screen i think that just five buttons
are sufficient one to go up left right down and uh enter and you you you
just select the functionality you want to access or things like that you don't have to to switch
to a channel to another uh
yeah but
yeah but if you look at the l c d  you you don't look at the t v  screen so i i it's not really worth to get to have the image if you don't look at so
yeah
yeah

yeah
well so we we can think about a well a a vocal command like uh find
and when the remote control uh hears fine well yeah just uh
to make him beep or t
yeah
yeah
put
yeah
and that's a good idea that's simple like in phones
yeah
yeah
yeah if there if there uh there is nuff not enough battery
also and uh uh the remote is lost
yeah
okay
they were ugly they
well the last one with the um
yeah with the two parts was uh original so
yeah
yeah
well we can think about uh having uh on the on the on the user interface when you switch
on the t v  you can uh well write a code or choose a
category if it is kids uh things like that
so for mm yeah
so for my part i will check the prices the um the prices difference uh of what to use where to use and s uh and so on
yeah
yeah
well i think we can we can have just numbers for channels and you can say to your remote control
like uh sports and then on the t v  you have a list with with uh uh well with sports
program playing now and and uh
that's right yeah yeah
well but well e every possible word uh has a probability to come about of the t v  so
yeah yeah
yeah but well okay

yeah yeah
mm mm
well i
yeah
well i uh i also
i i also think about uh another problem if if there is uh more than one person
who is watching t v  the s well the the speech uh r recogniser should
be able to distinguish between the two because uh i remember when i was a
young child with my sister we yeah we always want to
w to watch different emission at the at the same time so it's a pr it could be a problem if uh
if well if someone passes by when you are watching t v  and say oh t v  thirty
and just run s
yeah yeah
yeah
yeah that's well i think that's a good uh a good option because it's simple and uh simple to implement also so

okay

okay
so i see ya

yeah
yeah

oh
but people are often enough looking at the help once they see the help button they say oh this is a complicated
stuff it's a psychology okay
and let us see what the market demands we could just go to my presentation
yeah that's right
i mean it just showed us the remote with an cap which could be used for kids and if you remove the
same remote with some
both yeah
and then we can decide what what we can yeah
so
we just made an marketing survey of what people need from our remotes and how it could be special
from the other remotes and we got the best on the responses from the questionnaires
uh we also have some prizes for the most creative solutions and we found the following solutions which
we could which would be helpful for our design so seventy percent of the users they find
their remote controls very ugly they don't find it pleasant to use in the size or usage or anything
and eighty percent of the people they are always l i mean they are willing to spend more money
if the remote control would look fancy
and the current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user
and seventy five percent of the users
said they zap a lot and fifty percent say they use only ten percent of the buttons so the rest
of the ninety percent of the buttons they're not used most of the times so this were the findings which we found
and also they cited frustrations with the present remote controls most of fifty percent
of the time the remote controls are lost somewhere in the room and people are always searching for them
rather than watching the t v  and by the time they found the remote control the program is finished so
they're frustrated a lot
and um if the remote control is too complicated it takes much time to learn the functionality of it
so you can just see the percentage fifty percent people they responded that they always lose their remotes and thirty four
percent they say that it's quite difficult to learn if it's too complex
so keeping in view all these findings and the frustrations i think this
should be the solution for them we should have an l c d  on the rem remote control
mm hmm
i mean as our survey says that people are willing to pay more if their remotes are fancy so
if we have a l c d  on the remote rather than looking onto the t v  you just look into a remote
and navigate it it's the same menu as we have saw that ipod remote control we
just play around
yeah
yeah
i mean this were the points which we got from the market demands so
the other one
yeah that's fine yeah i mean that's
mm hmm
uh yeah we have uh
i mean that should be found out by the industrial designers
and it's always good to have an voice recognition for the remote controls
yeah it's o only for a limited vocabulary say eighty commands or so
mm the scroll button from the survey we never see that people would like to have some scrolling button because they they just they're just frightened to use the scrollings or help button
yeah

they're not used much

or it could be like this as the people say if they have a l c d  on the remote not on the television because when you
have the l c d  onto the television screen you miss the picture in the background
we are most focused on the commands so if you have then l c d  in the remote you just have a menu
and increasing and lower these signs here to change the programs and this menu when you press the menu
in the l c d  displays as you go on pressing the menu it faster displays volume then the program
then the brightness contrast and all the stuff and accordingly you can just increase or decrease
yeah that has to be checked out
yeah
okay
i mean better if we could just check all the cost with l c d  and also with the speech recognition and then we could find which would would be a more suitable in this case
and the third problem was to find the remote control always so fifty percent of the people say they lose the remotes so
yeah that's right that's exactly what i mean by voice commander or it could be also something like this uh
it's always boring to change the batteries of the remotes control so we have some one charger there and
whenever we don't use the remote control we put it in the charger and when we're using that t
remote and if we misplace somewhere in the charger we have a small button and just by pressing the button in the charger
the uh remote control beeps wherever it is
i mean it doe it also doesn't require a voice command because there are problems with a voice command
yeah yeah yeah i mean charger would be fixed because it's always with electricity plugged

yeah that's right
it's an good reminder yeah that's right
and of course the final point is a fancy look as we have seen earlier the
remotes which were displayed by norman they weren't fancy i mean mm very big or something with lot of buttons i think we should have something it
i mean uh i mean uh i mean uh you see if it's like that even a kid who wants to have a control he could just plug it and use it you can't avoid him but you can have an button for child lock
so just by pressing the button with some code you t you put a lock onto the remote so that he can't use even
mm uh
that's right
i think these other four points they're the market demands and so it's for the user interface design and industrial design to just think
yeah i think it should be clearer for us in the next meeting that th uh these could be included
no we have a problem there you see uh if you have a voice commands and you are s you are watching
a score on uh basketball score or something and if the score comes twenty four thirty five you've just say twenty
five and suddenly the screen the channel goes to twenty five so i think there should
be a prefix to some numbers
i mean the the you just check all the probability that saying t v  twenty five and just ordinary twenty five ordinary twenty five you almost there's a probability of being said around sixty seventy percent and t v  twenty five
i dunno it will be round about one or two percent so it's better to have some prefix before the number
yeah something some code
that will be too big and it will be difficult for the vocabulary also
als might be you just forgot the channel name you kno only know the number then
yeah the
yeah yeah
yeah
a and in the same lines we would have a one more problem if we are using the television in the different environments say in the factories
or in the shops where there is a lot of noise and this voice commands if they fail to work that would
bring a bad name bad uh reputation for our company so i think we should specify some
pre requirements if we want to use a voice commands say that it should be used in an silent homely environment
or s something
yeah that's right that should be an option
i think these are the practical problems
so we need to take care of them in the design
okay
oh it came there on three minutes back so we are i think we can just press the okay
okay see you another thirty minutes
yeah
yeah

yeah uh so let's perhaps uh in the meantime talk about the um um
numbers we assign to the dialogue acts because um yeah i didn't know
that you left out those who don't have words so i just extracted
the actual dialogue numbers and the problem is um it's perhaps more
um dangerous to get mistaken with all those numbers and
not knowing why things happen if we just devote numbers and n make new
uh n n
yeah sure but i mean for all those measures that are based on words um i can automatically
just throw those where it's nothing but um those dialogues acts um like
thirty three in in the first meeting um they have a duration even though
they don't have a word um so for my earl other measures i i get them
and i don't i mean i would have to look for every single
write a programme that looks for everything a number and does the mapping for that
yes
why is that
mm hmm
yeah i just wanted to uh um why do you think it's necessary at all to do that
yeah and it's a problem if there's no
but actually i think there is something in the audio shouldn't there if there's um even though there's not a word i think in the audio there will be something at that point because it has a duration
hmm
so d you cut it out
yeah i mean but why do you have a special for those it's just
yeah
yeah uh i mean it's just a question i wanted to raise
oh okay s
so um by how did you assign the dialogue act number did you take the one you found in the in the um x m l  file and just know put it there or did you
okay okay you end up with okay
mm hmm
mm hmm

no
who has that going
yeah
mm








presentation is exactly in two weeks
um uh and re i think we should start to think about evaluation by now i mean if you want to have some people
yeah but it's just uh three days between the presentation and the yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah i think we should ha take the time because i think it will be
but we'll also have to write the the thing in that time
i don't know but it's fifty percent of the mark
no
yeah
yeah it would buy us something





no
mm hmm

uh that really yeah that makes it really quite difficult for us if we want to test our stuff the first have to fight for our computers without cards
yeah sure i mean i yeah yeah i i just care for the written one does that work without the sound cards okay
okay yeah
hmm
okay do you want to have a look at the agreement and disagreement data that i worked on last week or do we have anything more on this
yeah
m perhaps my list of agreements perhaps my list of agreements somewhere
yeah if we find them good enough
we wanted to provide um that in an extra list saying probably agreement
yeah for example yeah
mm hmm
hmm it's a bit small but i don't know why that is hmm strange
yeah perhaps p because it's wide screen or something yeah but um okay what you see
here um in this part is uh no mouse yeah there it is yeah
here is um a list of the uh um
most important or yeah most probable words that occur in agreement
um so the number in the first brackets is um
so i run it on all the b e d  b m r  and b r o  meetings to learn it
um so uh the number in the first brackets is how often it occurred in the um
utterances that were annotated as agreements by the uh dialogue act agreement
um and the number in the second brackets is how much it occurred in the rest
and um the first number in every line is um how much more often that
is per same um same text length so
um the num uh the words that uh it gives it are look quite
good i think it's um yeah exciting perfect true interesting exactly correct super and so on
um and then i ran it on the first meeting getting um
the so what's in the in the brackets in this window here is
the utterances um and the moment it can't make any differences betwe
i mean you get the same value for every utterance that is exactly or every utterance that is
sure
and um for the longer utterances i just um look how often
um one of these words is in there and simply add it up
so that should in principle favour longer utterances
um and yeah and so these numbers here um one or zero these here
um that's um
um the dialogue act labels whether it's um um if they're
annotated as agreement they're not zero here so here um
for those who get a v that get a very high score um they're mostly no not zero
and some of those who are zero are o are still very good like i i definitely agree um
it's a nice kind of agreement that we probably want to have
um and when you get further down yeah you see those with very low
prob um score also have um no agreements
here they are a lot of zeros
yeah



yeah yeah right so it looks quite good i think
um so that's what i got for agreement then for disagreement i did also but um it's a bit
more difficult because there's so little disagreement yeah so there you
s again see the list but it's much shorter and it's mu much worse
smilies
um that is um here at the list of utterances it um gets us for the first meeting
yeah i mean i think perhaps that's why we have but uh rated so high here
or think i think uh yeah think is also rated higher in the non agreement than in the agreement i mean there is some funny things
um yes yeah that's effectively what i'm getting here
yeah it's just i mean it's it's exactly this thing but just i would i would just have to re scale this factor here and i mean this is the dialogue act number so
yeah i can just give it to you in the format you want so it w it will just k
and then score yeah it this was just for showing it huh
yeah
okay
um one problem i used to have is with all the yeahs because i mean obviously
they all write it the same so um i was thinking perhaps
at looking um at the um acoustic measures i have so for example at my f  zero
um deviation but um yeah by now i just had a look at the
yeah data um and actually the average
f  zero deviation is only slightly higher for the positive ones
than for the negative ones i mean there is a p difference but it's probably not significant
enough to really make use of it but i perhaps investigate some
time still to
yeah so and i th my my hypothesis was that if it's really yeah uh like agreement it will sound different than if it than into if it is just a back channel
mm
but that has nothing to do with the threshold because you have uh you have um you don't
have it only with yeahs you have it also with words that are much higher ranked you have the same problem like
for example with yep is much higher ranked because it occurs
less often um in the training thing
no um it's only if they're used in different contexts
yes i b yeah i know that not every yep is an agreement because y um this right yep and okay things are typically also back channels
yeah but we would throw a lot away that are quite good
if you if you would set it off
yes
mm hmm
yeah
i think for this meeting um there were um what was it like ar around si or ninety annotated agreements or yeah ag agreement dialogue acts
so
i mean the b the best ones are definitely those on the first screen here so it could just
mm hmm yeah okay
yeah probably have to plot them 'cause some of them are also i mean this is just added by different speakers
for example they are immediately following one another but it's just two speakers agreeing i think
same for this one here for these two here
i mean they they will be optically merged anyway


yeah okay that was just what i
i onl only keep uh the stuff i actually need on it and then i clean it up every you know every
but actually this all here is n l s s d  because it was data a  that didn't fit on my um quota anymore okay

yeah same thing uh um with the yoohoos and so on

that do not include mm



okay then you you will provide a file with all the mappings from the old ones to the
unique ones

mm hmm yes
yeah but not too detailed so




um by the way how long um how much time do we have for the presentation
yeah but more like twenty minutes or more like an hour
yeah i mean if you if you if you present the components of what it it's based on then you will need more than twenty minutes to present it i guess it's question
yeah then

my computer uh it doesn't have linu linux so
mm
yeah

yes
and you would otherwise it would be too complicated to cope with the thi uh system if you have to re adjust it uh to a different zoom level to get better results i mean it would behave strangely in the eyes of the user



i'm not a hundred percent sure but i'm not having crashes at the moment so what i'm having is
so we we had a we had a long problem about not finding out why the time
synching up between the relative time in in a in a sort of in a in a summarised section and the absolute time didn't correspond
and stuff and we found it was some stupid well at the moment our best guess is that it was some stupid java thing about
if you if you actually if you have two objects and you say object if you say a  equals b  they actually reference to the
same thing so any changes you make to one are made to the other and if you do that around five corners you lose track of it and you suddenly
wonder why that value is zero and it turns out it is zero because it's the same thing that you anyway uh
so we figured out it's interesting why don't i have a screen here now actually that's new but that's okay it's doing
different things all the time like this is the first time that actually the but uh uh that should be okay that should be okay i'll i'll be able to
yeah but last time i pressed that key combination everything went wrong and i think i'll be able to do it just fine on the screen so that'll probably keep me
from pointing on my screen which i usually it might just be at this point like there's sometimes a point to
loading not usually that long well let's see anyway so n uh let's just see what happens
in the end we did get it working before
oh see i get yeah yeah
ah so now i'm having a complete mess of like split
split screens and stuff i think last time yes but that's not what we want is it so
but i think if i this is a log out command and usually it resets this amazing
strange colour combinations i see in front of me at the moment
yeah we somehow always get it working but in different ways every time um
so that kept us like basically from doing anything else product qu for quite some time in the last days because
we were um hunting down that stupid error i got it fixed in the last whatever one hour or something but so
at the moment the program is sort of in between working and not working because we've done lots of changes to what the error was
dave i think actually that the summary at the current moment isn't working a hundred percent correct but that could be because
of the input data it seems to just take the first utterances more or less
like if you if you first if you read through the summaries they read suspiciously fluent like as in people's questions and answers and then if you plot them on the screen where where they are at the moment they seem to o
yes so maybe that's where the problem is coming from
yeah um
so this is when you start shifting around your laptop to think that it gets somehow less sloped on the screen um
so i'm not really sure what this meeting is about to be honest um i'm i'm gonna show this just what we have at the moment
but it not gonna look very different from what we had last time don't ask him what happened to the promise
that you'll get your script where you can use your own stuff because actually that was sort of ready but then we sort started trying
to get something more working and then we got into big problems so at the moment i mean again we should be at a state where people can load their own
sc okay
yeah
thing is a at the moment it's just really bad for me but from monday on i can just do twenty four
seven for this one until it until it's due but until monday it's gonna be really bad like i can probably
help people if they have problems with getting getting what we have running now but
okay
so i'll just start it up what we have now and then we can talk about what different people have and stuff
huh
eek
yeah it doesn't
but sometimes you have to take whatever you get and then just see how far that gets you

but would that not happen at some sorry i'm jum jumping in would that not happen at summarisation anyway even if they're in the w like with the ones that have no words and then not have really low information density or something
hmm
'cause you'd reckon that you could leave them in and they would never show up in a summary anyway
we wouldn't you think that if we just write the programme the way that even in the p way that it displays
everything it still leaves those out like if we those a special information density i d  or if you just put a spe
yeah something like that and then just make sure that summary even in the in the most summarised mode just
never puts them in
hmm
'kay shall we take a quick look at the current sys
sorry
yeah it is actually it is it is jumping now sorry
yeah it did s it did summarise just now it's just it's summarising stupidly but at least it's jumping shall
yes and in fact at the moment i don't even know which of the two i'm summarising over do you know y are w are we
um so at the moment the configuration is that word
importance file is test three and t d i d f  file is test two i've just i've just switched them around so i have no clue what we're actually
doing at the moment
yeah especially since i've just especially s since i've just switched them around anyway but
that's okay i by the way i read a paper which makes an important point about combining two things of that type
um that's basically it's it's t going on about this fancy called geometric mean which effectively just means multiplying them
but i i have some good f information about different ways how you can
sort of weight two different factors because it's uh like it it's for something very similar somebody would try to solve a very similar problem where they also
had two factors sort of and they want to weigh them together and there is like a good justifiable reason um why we should
do in a certain way and how we can then with a simple parameter adjust how much one weighs and how much the other weighs so there is
something for just for putting them together in a relatively simple way but still a way that we can sort of justify
um and we can quote stuff on that yeah sure we hmm no it's multiplying them and
and like putting them one over the power of something and the other over minus one one minus the power of something and that's sort of and
they they've plotted some graphs about like where they show f like one going from zero to the one and the other going zero to one and like how the how
the landscape changes and how i the parameter changes how it works so it's quite good um
so that's probably seeing that we're probably not gonna go into any whatever base blah blah blah markov
model blah blah blah about f combining them um that's probably what we go at
now this is still not ideal at the moment dave it's it's sort of it's overrunning the f like it so okay so
at the moment we're that far that if i now click onto a segment hits
yeah it's just wait sorry i just re sized it a bit yeah so it's j like the values are sort of hard coded for the screen sizes in dice and my screen's smaller
so let's see i was a stupid user and was clicking on this segment we probably
have to make the segment lines a lot bigger so then i h i did i get a new summarisation yeah i didn't actually see so let me check a different one
yeah so you see it's a different text and you see it it's running through it and also you see the indicator in
where we are is jumping so it's it's skipping stuff now i don't think the summary at the moment is what we wanted to be seeing
the words like oh and mm and exactly exactly right sure this seems probably sh this is again probably
the opposite of what we want so it's probably some value that you have to like divide by one uh one divide by the value of something but
yes but also every other word in that sentence we should look at are probably in your list of fifty
like list of all important words in the universe so yes but it's probably just because if you look at the other
one like this is just their best sentence for like having function words in a row
sort of and every o other i mean this one is sort of the developing a big infrastructure so maybe it's just doing it randomly
at the moment i don't know but we have some summary working and that's a good basis to start from if i promise
now that you'll get something where you can put your own data and that's sort of ringing a bit hollow
yeah yeah uh still it's uh it it's might be having some problem i think this one over ran just
before so we might still have some problem here that it's not stopping at the end but so dave can you make the promise
even i'm not making the promise realistically that the girls will very soon get
okay yeah
yeah s
s so at the moment i've hard coded it to just um taking one tenth of the number of utterances which were in the original selection
yeah it actually it gives you an error if you put it to twenty because there's some things in there which are shorter than twenty and if you select those than it's having an
yeah but i think like a b a proportional one is probably not bad idea that's bl i mean an an absolute length is sort of a bit strange
because that means that some utterances will not be changed in length i know but we had that discussion before and i'm confused myself about
what i think about it so the fact that this is going on beyond that green line here is something that's not ideal
but that's something we have to sort out but this is working in general does anyone have a general
overview over the whole time issue like as in what date is it today what
date do we have to have this presented what day of the week is that and issues like that
so the presentation is now sh two weeks from today
'kay one week from today i shall hear the freedom ring from
the hills and and everything and shall then throw myself into new slavery
ah no really and the report
writing the report won't be so bad how long is it expected to be
i know but uh if everyone like if everyone is managing three pages for their bit then that's gonna be that that's a big report then
and stuff so yeah but evaluation ah
you think
we should probably inquire about that or like integrate tool tips that would be visible
having said that dave we could probably w like if we want we could probably go back to the c um to the group
directory and just use this trick it really seems to be all about starting in the directory but i mean if if the two of us are just
working on it it doesn't make a difference 'cause i've already mounted your directory now so and probably
mm
what
well if it's just multiplying to numbers it can be done in the programme 'cause then we can um because what we could
do is have a slide bar where we can adjust this value actually if you can figure out a way like how basically
a general way because there's at least two points at which we are interested in that how we can just have a slide bar
which we can read and write to which is in a frame of that type that would be good it shouldn't be difficult should it i mean should just be
yeah but it might be more diffi uh let's see it you could if you're lucky you probably have just to extend that class and then you can work with that value but if you're unlucky it might be quicker to just write a very simple string component which is just the s just a bar
yeah yeah yeah so because we'd basically it would be good to have two different ones to play around with one for controlling the length of the summary and another one for
um for the merging factor if we do it that way with the chi metric

yeah yeah it's it's just a single formula effectively yeah um how is the audio thing going is that you've probably not had time to work on that
'kay it seems that at the moment a lot of the stuff that has to be done at sort of at the moment i'm saying oh dave can you do that so that's not ideal
oh
okay
'cause i think i mean the audio is a v in the end the audio is a very important component of it just because it's it's gonna look stupid if we have everything working but just if
the speech tools
hmm is there any way for x  forwarding sound
'cause that would be sort of the nice way to sit at home and have it forward the sound at the lowest bit rate
to you i mean seeing that it's over broad band it's forwarding the graphics quite okay it would probably
like broad band wise band width wise probably work out
but it's probably not and uh not a simple thing
hmm
y are you not creating files anywhere like sort of real files so that you can do on a dice machine independent of w
yeah one problem with s s h  ing in general is that the machine that like on the only gateway machines
they hate you for doing anything on them and there's no simple way at least i haven't found one
to directly in in a single step sort of s s h  and then s s h  again
well actually i guess if you put s s h  and you know c you can give a command outright after with s s h  so if that c command
is s s h  again and if you that would require that you have all your key files set correctly which i
haven't because it always fucks up on my system maybe if you get that working then you should be able to directly go into another machine
uh
yeah
yeah 'cause a p a primitive version of the sound to have relatively soon would be good i think
ok okay okay okay okay
okay good so to come back to the problem we had before so the reason why the summary didn't work well in the last
one and works well now is because based on the bottom data the data is so homogeneously
high in its imp importance rating that it just sort of then everything else being equal it took the first
ones more or less but now it's working better because now it's on a much more evenly distributed
well
the most professional way of doing it would be to map them according to the standard deviation 'cause that way it au would automatically always
that's sort of like it it's the problem is it's more calculation expensive and slightly more complicated even though it's actually like in terms of calculation
it's not much heavier but like you know generally about standard deviation
yeah it's it's a g it's a very simple simple formu it's basically just whatever the average of r mean square differences from the mean or something which the problem with it is that generally you first have to get the mean and only t only once you have the mean you know what
in one go yeah i've derived that i've derived that myself like i didn't find it so i did it myself
and it took me a day with the formula but then i'm slow at maths so the the good thing about that would be that if you simply say that whatever one
standard deviation below the mean is zero and one standard deviation above the mean is one or two standard deviations or something
then whatever the data is like it would always normalise
yeah it's it's not the simplest but that like that's the most professional way i can think about it y that would indirectly also drop stuff
i mean that would drop whatever is below or above so if you find that formula that
would be good otherwise i can see if i can still understand like i did it in my programme it's uh it's really stupid like the standard standard deviation
formula just requires you to have the mean initially and that makes some things exactly twice as computationally
expensive and there is a way of doing it cumula cumulatively
hmm
so yeah so that's one possible way of doing that
so the
and that's just in the loading stage right yeah that should actually be fine especially in the worst case we just introduce a small hour glass but anyway we
only we only gonna present this once and we can probably just like sort of start it up before the presentation
starts so if we shouldn't at all be worried about it's actually it's quite beautiful it's like if you b want a programme
only to run once and only a part of it you don't worry if it crashes afterwards if it wastes all the resources if it formats the hard disk in the end
anyway i'm rambling on um
d
no it does not it does not if y i changed it i just
so you would forget that that means that you would start it fifteen times over and have fifteen zombies running um
does anyone know anything about which dice machines have sound cards and how to find them
'cause the thing is we can like this at the moment wor is working because it has a sound card the interesting thing is that because
it's structure of this it isn't enough to just say well if you don't have a sound card you don't have sound at least i think that's what
i remember our problem was that
yeah no so i've worked around that there is ways i think to get around it but the problem is
so you b you basically we have to we have to have two code versions then one for sound card and one for non sound card machines to test it on um
because it you have to change all sorts of other things if you don't have a sound card so there isn't a simple way to just
tell which ones the sound card machines are and just to use sound card machines is there
we
no but i guess i mean if you just if you trust in dave's summary for the audio just putting all these things into sound then then having a written summary
yeah yeah so the yeah yeah so i think dave really the easiest way is if you just make a sound card and a non sound card version of it because
yeah but then that means that the girls can't test it that's the problem like
yes but without the clock you don't have well actually you're right it doesn't like f it doesn't strictly have to do any movement in it yeah
yeah but we have to comment stuff out for that i think like at the moment if you click on a segment it automatically sets the whole clock
thing going and stuff so we have to comment out stuff so that's what i'm saying that there is we could make it that a flag couldn't we we could just
make that uh like a run time flag and then make a few ifs and say if
yes the p there is
yeah
yeah so anyway so that's something we should probably do in one way or another because it seems just that the overwhelming majority of dice machines don't have sound card
no nothing c much to talk about this so apart from like uh a search box and the similarity
thing f once that kicks off w which is gonna be horrible but um this is more or less in the end like this
is very similar to what our product will look like in the end seeing that realistically with the given time frame we're not gonna do
amazing new things from now on so i mean we'll hopefully be able t
huh
list of agreements
okay yeah
okay
uh yeah i think it would be good dave's right it could be good in the display to annotate them in the display if we can yeah we could just make
not just yet but that should that's actually that's probably the only i can say i can do this week because that should be i mean
i'll do it in an inefficient way i'll effectively sort of go through all the segments and check if they're clicked on but i think dave
what we should do is that th uh the time click of the clock i think that's changeable
and i think we should probably increase that because at the moment it's zero point one seconds and that's just there is
actually there are some background noise when it's working and i think that is because it's like doing so much every time
yeah it's probably because you d i'm not sure if you have the version where the display yet where the display is actually updating up here
when it's moving on so i mean yes it is because my display is programmed inefficiently but i think with the t given time constraints it's probably easier instead of
making a very efficient display code to just make the time make the clock whatever zero point five seconds or
something do you want the monitor
if i can skip more accurately then
uh you're
that's probably because it's coming from my resolution and it's you have a much higher resolution so
again i think that's probably a good part if we had a slide b um bar initially where
we could dynamically adapt the threshold of what we yeah so maybe it's just like
maybe b it's just good to have like some generic component with three slide bars or something where we can relatively easily add a fourth one or something
you know and just like sort of all our fiddle factors um because
uh well it depends we we could like in some cases we could put it as a feature and say you know you can dynamically
like
we wouldn't call it threshold we would sort of like the granularity of decision or something like it
so and yeah and every and everything above that threshold i could then add
the utterance where it occurs just put a certain graphical item like a handshake or something cool
yeah right
mm
yes i was j it i was just thinking the same like it's it's so tempting like we we'll we'll have yellow we'll have yellow smilies and yellow angry faces ah beautiful
didn't somebody say that actually like a lot of agreements have have actual words which should suggest disagreement like
yeah
yeah
if they're corresponding ea for each thing yeah they should be right so for each utterance you have one agreement and one disagreement score
uh something like it
okay yeah the one where we current
yeah yeah yeah you know what if you can
if you introduce um like a sort of a static what's it called public static int so basically a constant like that's
java's type of a constant and give them names like so zero t d i d f  one that probably makes the code
a lot more readable for everybody who's playing around with it you know you know what i mean so just like whatever three means
agreement value and then i'd just write something agreement and then it's easier to understand for both of us what's going on
hmm
i would also th yeah but i would also th
yeah
yeah
but you know what i think we should put the threshold for that one in the end quite high anyway so probably it doesn't make much of a difference because i think this thing
no but like
but i mean the fact that different ones have the same number in itself isn't a problem is it
so if if for every yep you'd be sure that it's an agreement than that wouldn't be a problem so you're saying that you're not sure if every yep is an agreement or
hmm
so over over how many different over which length is this now this is like
so the third column is the utterance where it occurs right okay so w i think we really do have to put the threshold
quite quite high then because
yes 'cause it i was just i was just checking you know like how far apart are they and at the moment that's definitely not a good thing to display if they're like an average ten ten utterances apart or something
mm hmm
mm hmm
again i'd say probably a good way of going about that question is to have a control which we can vary
in the dis and then just sort of because that's in the end how it's gonna be evaluated you know in the end it this is gonna li i mean we're
gonna present it and say yeah so this our it shows disagreements and then we see what what looks good and what looks
i think probably it looks credible if like an u if every sort of every topic segment has um
w yeah or like or like something in between the three and and five agreements but not more or
probably maybe less but not much less and actually the i think there doesn't have to be one in everything
n yes but maybe in an expensive way or maybe in a stupid looking way though um
yeah d i'm yeah i was just thinking that it can act it can probably be done on display level
this one crashed mine just crashed i think which is bad it probably just it kept on playing and now reached some whatever
my god
yeah
i think sort of the bottom line and which might well end up what it's gonna be like is that we take the single highest ranked utterance and put that as a t as a title like realistically looking at this from the the time we have left to do this and stuff
there w
yeah yeah maybe even on a s on a sing like i is that on a r like is that on a word basis would that be single words or would that be
'cause be check out what they would be like on a word basis maybe actually if it if there's one word which is very typical i mean it's probably some word like
uh because that's like the only time that uh was spelled with three a  and stuff i think that actually that might be a problem of the whole um
annotation that if they aren't exactly consistent in how they descri uh transcribe stuff like that
then we probably can't yeah 'cause that's when we're thinking sometimes like why
is mm high but then probably it's the only time that mm was spelled with a dot at the end and stuff so
but yeah like if if single w
i c i have dictionaries if it's just like i have arbitrarily long lists from the british national corpus of when t usually
well let's say at least they do it uh consistently enough that i think you can filter them out fairly well
yeah so if you if like i mean if the single ha best one word for a for a segment is interesting that would be really good
seem to be having
use a random s
'kay we're going backwards here now it suddenly crashes and hangs
yeah i mean that was that was sort of in the original of then the nice fancy drawings that we gave steven i mean that was part of it that sort of within
the segment you had these sub segments and each of them had different words and whatever happened to our dreams
are there assignments no i don't think we have
yeah
hmm poor man's solution is probably gonna be to have a a list
oh so j you you are think of loading them all at once
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
even though we
'kay
yeah yeah i think that like the dr the drawing has to be changed anyway the it's not ideal at the moment
um yeah so if performance wise it generally works fine for the display it shouldn't make much of a difference 'cause i
think everything in the display code is just from the first until the last one displayed so
if if the other performance is okay then we should really just load the whole thing in
i'm very dis
see that probably just means that the display sort of has an internal knowledge about what level of zoom it has so initially the display
yes
yeah
yeah that's probably fairly simple to do actually if we do it in that most primitive way of just saying as long as you display more than one meeting
yeah we then need some way of getting back up again in the hierarchy but that in the worst case
it will just be a static sort of arrow up button in the right hand topper corner of the display and you press that and then you're on
the display the whole thing again but for that at the moment my display code needs
that thing to work the one oh no that's working at the moment anyway the one that i just say give me
one hundred values over that length and then you're internally okay but yeah but uh that's okay as long
as my display i was just thinking my display can't handle displaying a million different segments but now r no but it doesn't
have to even now it doesn't have to okay well that's all details um so
dave can you just turn this what we have right now in
yeah make
uh and if an
if anyone feels that they have free time uh this is a joke um one thing that would be convenient
for all sorts of things and which i haven't found out about it is how to do tool tips in an arbitrary
way in in in swing graphic displays now there is simple ways of doing tool tips over a given element like if
you have a button and you just give it a tool tip text but there is means of doing tool tips that just i c i put my mouse over
let's say i put my mouse over this line here and then it would tell me something about what it is and that would be quite convenient for a lot of things because then we can sort
of have a lot of information in the display in the in the way that just when the mouse is over it but i haven't figured out how
it works and that's something that probably so if everyone is ever bored or anyone feels that they can do that
yes but
yeah but the the thing is it it isn't simply an act of setting a string default tool tip there seems to be something about a tool tip object that you have to create and give it all sorts of different properties and stuff or
yeah so anyway i haven't looked much into that so if if anybody looks into that then let me know otherwise i'll start looking into it as soon as i have time again but if anybody
yeah i found some stuff about it on the web and it just looked to me like proper coding like i saw
half page code samples which effectively just displayed a tool tip and i didn't have the time at that point to get
deeper into that so if anybody gets any good samples of that never anyways
that is that it for now
no but i'm gonna i'm going up appleton tower now and i have my external hard disk so i can
yeah
is there any dice machines in this building freely accessible for me can you show me where because i'm actually not going to appleton tower at the moment so then i don't have to go up and down actually no but i have to go there anyway and put a piece of paper on two machines where some stuff of mine is running on
yeah and i think like i'll just i'll just kick in full time for n l s s d  next week 'cause there's
nothing i have to do then apart from cognitive modelling which i think i'll just do in five hours three
hours you take a look at that
hmm i might just not go for the last question because usually the last question is takes half the time and gives you five percent or something like okay

really
okay

no maybe he has mentioned it to them but they just never talked to us i mean we didn't talk to them so
it's sort of coming as a shock to me now because i was sort of in this mindset like i first knew oh there's a lot of time between the presentation and
the report and then i knew oh now the presentation is shifted but the correlation between those
two facts the interdependencies there's some fancy planning language about that but that
yes it's um it's probably some version of the frame problem frame plob problem hasn't been clear to me
well i reckon that it
i reckon that probab
but if you just present the functionality of the thing if you're not like i don't think this presentation is about the internal working so
yeah so for a demo i think realistically since everything in this university sort of works in one hour slots and stuff so if it's
two groups then it probably it's gonna be roughly half an hour ish
hmm
no why is th this is gonna be so bad like there's gonna be some small l
yeah but the performance is really bad at the moment on that one though
plus we would have to get the speech tools running on my laptop then wouldn't we
mm
well let's let's see did it it could just be fluent on the laptop for all i know i mean like at the moment it's not too bad apart from i think the sound is stuttering and that's b i think because of the laptop but we can only really judge that once we have sound files
how fast is yours vera
mm hmm
well net would run on anything but
yes
no that's true yeah that's true virtual machine should be fine but but but that all relies on finding some way of getting the speech tools to do their job
yeah see that's 'cause that's the thing like that would rely on i just don't think it's a good idea to run the speech tools in
no no no no d wherever this is going it doesn't sound good um
we can he can use my laptop as sort of like as a as a server as a sound server but that would still mean that we have to get the speech tools running on this no you know i think i mean the way java works is that t
i think it'll run on on their dice machine if we're doing it in if we well we should definitely test it the day before
yeah 'kay
so dave are you gonna make something primitive that people can load their data in
ok
yeah
yeah i'm not i'm not a hundred percent sure what needs to be changed to make it work with the to make it not crash if it doesn't have a sound card there's there's quite a bit you have to comment out for that which is stupid because i
yeah the yeah no but the thing is the display calls methods which probably expect some so i think if the
display itself isn't doing anything clocky so as long as in the main pr in the programme manager everything
clocky is is removed but uh i w it might be worthwhile to check how much work it would be
to do it over a flag 'cause then in the end i 'cause otherwise we always have two code versions and people might be changing the wrong one
okay okay yeah that's true i just i know that like if you don't do it with the exceptions crashes that's what figured out like if you don't have a sound card it crashes even if you don't use sound yeah okay cool
uh i think the display has some method for it i'm not actually like for the programme manager then to call i'm not actually a hundred percent sure what it's called but the display has some method where you tell it where to start and where to end
yeah or there's gonna be something
well actually dave da dave dave dave
okay no sorry i've uh i was wrong i was thinking it's exactly the same thing that happens when we say set select no it does not but actually a set selection does everything you want sort of

no but set selection doesn't update the display though because well it it doesn't tell the display which part to di which part to to display because the display has just called set selection to
if
yeah but that only works that at the moment isn't done through our system that's just done because then the time changes
so actually a time change would automatically put the position of the display in the right play uh no
but that's not a good idea because that could well be outside the displayed area then
yeah so
yeah no i think the display has a method for that ready which is called
anyway the display has something useful for that something which probably starts with the word set
yeah you can set the window start utterance and window end utterance

hmm
alternatively there's always the method of just giving it a really high score as a hack you know like just as long as you then don't well probably people wouldn't know
hmm
well you could you could put one point one when the other ones only go up to the one but no it's it's not it's not a nice way i'm just saying
yeah probably that actually true that if you're doing a search you're usually not interested in a condensed way but in the in the full thing anyway
yeah
yeah
i think proportion like i even though i'm i'm always getting myself confused about this but i think sort of making the summary
length thing generally proportion like as a as a proportional factor of of its original length is a good
way of going about it because anything with absolute length's sort of stupid because that means that a long long segment gets to one
percent of its length and another one gets to exactly the same length and stuff so if we're doing it by a proportion then just having one point zero
or something makes it very easy to always end up at the actually that's what i've currently like the current code just
takes a tenth of the summary length so yeah and that's the type
of slider that we can actually leave in and like show 'cause that's that's functionality yeah that's sort of like your level
of the zoom of impending doom shall we quit here
anything to be discussed
'cause i'm gonna copy that stuff over
yeah otherwise you'll you'll definitely see me in m s n  so i'll just

it might be a problem for me at the stage right now because i based everything on not having those um
yeah
uh what i also
yeah what i also did was having two people um annotate the first meeting
and so they didn't annotate the n n uh uh the spaces and everything would mess up i
think if i had spaces for the um new values so
when i went to do correlation it wouldn't work anymore so i don't know
oh what i could do is um work um further with um
what i've got now and then just when i have my um um
yeah the final formula ready i could uh t apply to the new stuff that would be
okay
um
no my um yeah what my um t f i d f  is based on colin's data so
um i end up with the same yeah
is it still the old old t f i d f  oh okay


hmm
yeah
i think so too
how about the summarisation again you wanted to base it on sentence length as well and i've got a sentence length incorporated into my importance measure at the moment so
okay but if we do it twice it wouldn't make too much sense don't know how exactly we will want to implement your





we can
are we still with that idea that we want to display bars for the individual speakers okay and also displaying the speakers before an utterance
okay






so toby you wanted to uh have keywords for each topic segment or something um who would uh who uh provides the values for that
no one
right
because what i do is um having um values for each segment at the moment so
i could just extract the highest ones for each segment i don't know if that's good or bad
it could be at least i could provide some value
uh it it doesn't matter to me i could do both okay

mm

mm

yeah
hmm
yeah
especially when the segments are really long



mm

at least their names and if we have their names then we can get their email
mm









sixteen times zero


does it i have to check that out
hmm
it depends which data you use as well because um if you use the data where they're all really high it does prefer ones from the beginning because it just picks the first ones it finds
but i'll check it out anyway

yeah i've got time now like um for the next couple of days i'll do some on it 'cause i was just too busy last week
what's that that's creeping over the other screen

that's really weird 'cause it's just started creeping over
um well as long as the two correspond then it's fine

oh right i see
okay so would it be would it be easier if there's a reference file with the actual real i d  and the corresponding number so
is there some already
so would that solve the problem basically
because the whole programme works on them being numbered at the moment
um it'd be a lot of word for really no extra p feature gain at all
or do you think it could appear in the summary
well if it's something in the audio that's just like a noise then we don't want it
yeah
yeah
i don't i don't know you 'cause the thing is it depends if we want to have it display the whole thing at once
if you left them in hopefully it wouldn't affect the way the programme works
well i don't in the programme it's just they're not in the raw text files

well either way
either way is fine by me as long as the two wo things um tie up as far as i'm concerned it doesn't really matter whether those are in or out
no minus one or something
yeah certainly possible
actually yeah 'cause the t f i d f  wouldn't make any sense with
so maybe we should just omit them then
okay so maybe we should leave them out then
oh it's the bar is working now
oh so the summary is probably okay 'cause it does the job
yeah
oh i can't remember which one it is at the moment
yep that that those names are mislead well the t f i d f  is fine but word importance is completely misleading it's not word importance at all


is it very complex or is it r oh just multiplying together to a power yeah i've seen that before
yeah
yeah i've seen that before actually

yeah
ah it's still working like it should do

yeah
so it did work
yeah that that is ancient data though so
having said that it's picking out some interesting stuff like we're looking at atlas you'd expect to score quite high
yeah maybe but atlas you'd have thought it'd be quite high

i'm just quite surprised it all actually worked because i've been working it we've been working on like incomplete versions that haven't worked for a long time and like to see it all come together

yeah i'll do the first thing i'll do is make a load box for selecting a file
and a script that sets the class path so it can be run with just a script so p class path is like this long
but we'll have parameter for that yeah
and twenty yeah we need to add some sanity checking in some of the stuff
yeah


but we don't we don't need it evaluated for the presentation do we
is it oh 'cause it was moved back wasn't it yeah
i can rope people in to to doing it a few people at least
as long as we design it as long as we design it before hand uh i think we can probably manage to actually do it in the three days after
you're talking about the user evaluation
we should probably write some user documentation 'cause i bet that will get us marks
yeah they'd love that kind of stuff just we'll just write you know little help files or something
yeah
have you java doc ed it
and also where is it
okay 'cause the code version in the group directory is not the right one yeah
okay
in directory yeah
okay well we should wait till we have it ready for um you guys to use then we'll put it back in the group directory
so i'll try and do that today 'cause i've got time today and as long as i don't run into problems i don't see it taking too long
well in that case it it's probably just i mean that's probably fine i mean
yeah
i'm not sure how much should be done in the programme because uh
i don't know i think it should probably be done off line
the basic uh combining of all the factors
yeah yeah sure
hopefully we can take over that right one 'cause we don't need it that'd be quite nice
i bet you can just uh just add it to the um panel like what i bet that's a pre made swing component that little slider and all you do is add it to a panel
yeah
can you send me a link to that paper so that i'll implement that in summarizer
oh no i've not looked at it yeah like last week i just not done anything but can't see it taking long again
but to be honest i did like nothing really on it last week so and i've got time today tomorrow and probably friday so
mm hmm
it's just annoying because i need to do that on a dice machine so i can't get them to compile under windows
yeah and um most the dice machines don't have working sound cards so
no idea
yeah
i'm not sure how it if it if it can do sound or not i've no idea
but like what i can do is um
i i'm pretty confident that it'll just be writing a script and it will just go and as long as i can test the script like once and it's working fine i can just make it return dummy stuff so it works on other machines
yes so
oh actually i know what i can do i can then
i can change the script so if i'm using my one at home i can just add s s h  stuff in to ev evoke the sound tools on the uh on dice and then copy 'em back
yeah
hmm
yeah
i'm sure i can figure out some way to do it anyway
if it comes to it i'll just um install netbeans and stuff on my linux machine and work on that
well that to be honest there won't be a primitive in between stage just it'll just work hopefully in theory at least anyway
i wonder if we should um do something like dropping the bottom third then re mapping the lowest remaining one to zero and scaling it like that 'cause you get a much nicer distribution like that
um i've not used it to do that before but
yeah
there is a way of calculating it um yeah well calculating it cumulatively but i can't remember it
yeah
yeah that's probably quite a good idea
yeah yeah that's probably quite sensible
yeah i can't remember it off hand but i know there is one
but it could be it could be fine i mean running over the data twice probably is okay yeah
mm

yeah never closes the process when he does it now they used to not um close the process when you click the cross

yeah it refuses to r load the clock for some reason i don't know why
yeah you still you st yeah you still get the written one and the display the only thing you don't get is the clock
i don't think we should bother 'cause we'll run it on a sound card version
th yes they can all that happens is it refuses to load load the clock you still get the display in the summary
so the yeah the move uh but you can still click on the segments and that'll still work won't it
okay yeah
um oh there must be a way of detecting whether the clock's loaded like in fact there there is you can try and set something on the clock and use try and catch and then if you catch the exceptions set the flag
we could put those on display
instead of a list what about putting it in the display
can you click on a point in time in display and jump to there yet
okay
'cause that'd be pretty good
no i don't get that on my machine
no i don't no
okay
as long as you can skip more accurately than the time steps that's fine 'cause otherwise you might risk cutting bits off
like if you want to jump to a point you need to be able to jump more accurately than half second by half second you'll miss words
yeah i think so
oh yeah i can yeah i can do that
of what we display yeah
yeah yeah
obviously we'll hide that in the presentation
but we don't want i don't think we want to have exposed to the user doing things like adding the threshold of which agreements we display
decision
yeah they uh that does look quite promising doesn't it
so you can have happy faces and angry faces

yeah yeah that makes sense so can you um
so will that produce basically an agreement and a disagreement score for every dialogue act
so could you put them in the same format as the other data and i'll make us t to read it in
oh right okay so i could probably i could probably read it from uh that file already
my preferred would be dialogue act number then you can put both the scores in one file you can put both the scores in one file if it makes it easier
yeah
agreement and one disagreement
so i'll read that into um i'll make it part of the get measure thing so you can just get it with a flag
using get measure
so you know how zero is t f i d f  one is um the well i've called it word importance but that's a really m misleading name
yeah probably
mm hmm
yeah okay
uh the problem is yeah is occurring not only as an agreement but really frequently as like uh an encouragement as well isn't it
yeah
how what's the highest um ranked one that that kind of problem occurs with 'cause if it's below about
'cause i saw there's ones up in the eighties wasn't there if it's below like fifty it's probably
or exactly no they're all but one
'cause we on the display we probably take quite high so it'd only matter if it occurs on ones that are really highly ranked
yeah well otherwise you'd get icons all over the place so anyway
yeah
so we want probably want to take a threshold at least of fifty or sixty just as a looking at that
to we probably won't want to display ninety we'd want to rate them as how important they were wouldn't we
yeah
yeah and see how it turns out
an agreement at the end
so yeah we'd probably want to merge ones that were very close into one
yeah
yeah
yeah and we should probably make some logic when it displays it that says if there's ones very close together it just centres it among the
yeah it's looking quite good though
i think it's always really funny that when you look at people's computers who don't use the computer much their desktop's really tidy and when you work with people who use it all the time there's stuff everywhere so mine's like that as well
yeah


yeah
yeah
maybe we should um download a dictionary and check our utterances before we uh listen to make sure that they're actually real words do you see what i mean

yeah i mean see how it turns out if they look good then that's a good way of doing it as any i suppose
actually what i think you should do is take the highest three or four and then just merge them together into one utterance it wouldn't make any sense but it'd give you an idea of what they're actually talking about if you see what i mean
yeah
yeah i don't think we're gonna have time for that
which is a shame 'cause it would've been cool
um at the moment it doesn't really care how many meetings it's displaying
just draw a big black line on the borders i think
well y you you can if you want to it's
'cause it ju it can display from any utterance to any other utterance it doesn't really
do they ah yeah i'd prefer them drawn continuously
okay because that way all we have to do to display ea more than one meeting is have a harder boundary drawn
one thing we will have to do is we want we'd really want a different behaviour if we clicked on a whole meeting
than a segment so if there's more than one meeting displayed it should
um if you click even on one the segments of that meeting i think it should re initialize and display that just
that meeting
so i'm not su i'm not sure how easy that would be to do
it just needs to know whether it's displaying more than one whole meeting doesn't it that's the only
knowledge it would need
but anyway we can sort that out if we have time once we've got everything else
yeah
that'll get s s sufficient to claim that we had implemented some kind of zoom as well

yeah
yeah it's not done the very clever way but it does work
mm hmm
basically do a code for ease on it
um i'll probably tonight just work on getting a frozen version that works consistently
and um if you could document it for me that's probably enough for me to add it in
unless you want to do it but my code i've not documented the programme manager class
so though it's a bit hairy at the moment isn't it
uh huh
okay so probably what you'd want to do is um
detect where the mouse is and change the default tool tip for that component
because it automatically displays at the correct position when you hover
yeah you might nor really want to be creating a new one every time you move the mouse
i'll have a look through some of my java books 'cause it might be the sort of thing they have in there
mm
is there all is that g version all in the
okay cool so i'll start working on that in like half an hour or something and it will be the
okay
we really need to get in contact with the other group and see if they want to do a joint evaluation
so you need to get their email addresses
are they
that'd be handy yeah we can get them
so you do is sending them an email 'cause i was hoping that steve would mention it ian 'cause we've mentioned it to him so many times but he obviously hasn't
yeah


s there's the frame problem
no i think it's coming together not bad at the moment actually
don't know
yeah
i can't see it going on for an hour to be honest
yeah i thought it was a demo basically
half an hour and like ten minutes of that would be probably set up time as well ten minutes of that will probably be set up time as well
i we maybe you should present it on your laptop 'cause we can be really sure it's running before we come
i could probably get my computer in if i could get someone to give me a lift i know a couple of people with cars
yeah 'cause i wouldn't need to bring a monitor or anything i'll just need to bring the box
i'm pretty sure i could nick a lift off someone
or j  builder in fact you won't even you shouldn't even need either as long as you got java installed
yeah
oh crap i forgot about that
cygwin maybe
in cygwin no but cygwin should run um the java as well

a sound server
hopefully yeah
yep i'll do that today and i'll yeah i'll make a script to run it and put that in the group directory
and i'll send around the email when it's done
it'll be the bit where it creates the clock or is there stuff in the display as well
okay
well it really we shouldn't even need a flag you should be able to do it with exceptions i mean that's this is kinda not exact case that exceptions are made for really
yeah
mm hmm
oh no it's gonna have to do something a bit more complicated than that what it will have to do is de register everything as time handlers and then update and then re register them
okay have you got a component for displaying lists of matches 'cause that'd be pretty useful cool
okay yeah i mean it's not it's not too hard to do all you have to do is de register everything that's a time handler
first before you add the stuff in but um depends
what behaviour we want do we want when you click on a search result we definitely want that one
to appear in the summary
yeah
yeah it sets if you look at set select that's essentially what you wanna do yeah
does it not
yeah but it w it doesn't matter because um if it's jumped to in the end text area then your display would the the line'll jump won't it
yeah
uh and also the real time and play time stuff would change so we yeah we need to re initialize the display then don't we
okay
but yeah we need to do something to ensure that the search result is in the summary that's created
so may we probably want a different summary constructor that takes an an additional argument of an i d  and it will that w utterance will always be in the summary
yeah i suppose but the trouble is that still doesn't guarantee that it'll appear because if you get enough of them that are high scored it prefers the first ones it sees
yeah i suppose
hmm maybe
but you could d you can um achieve the same effect
yeah
probably the way to handle that would be to make a summary that's the same length as the selection and that would ensure that the search term came up
yeah
yeah exactly
yeah but we'll have that slider obviously
yeah 'cause that's very useful thing
yeah
okay and i'll start work in say two will it be done by then




i know doesn't look great does it
uh uh
mm
yeah there is there's index files already yeah
yeah in the raw text index directory
yeah and it uh allows you to map between the different i d s
yeah i guess 'cause we can't show it in the display yeah they've been cut out the ones that don't have any words
suppose
huh
no i guess not
hmm that's just 'cause they would have a blank line in it seems a bit stupid but i can fit 'em back in if
yeah
yeah it's a cer uh
yeah my topic segmenter doesn't like blank lines either
mm
oh yeah cool
yeah another uh sh issue was that
hmm
hmm
oh yeah

huh
hmm
hmm
yeah

but yeah
yeah so yeah i don't know if we're gon
do you think we're gonna have time
is it not is it not only two days anyway
yeah that'd probably be quite good
yeah i've got a basic search working now it's g it's got a user interface so yeah no
uh i'm still in my directory but i i can put it in your directory
yeah yeah i've i've not been using that yeah yeah i've just been taking the the class files from your directory
hmm
yeah
hmm
hmm
hmm
hmm
hmm

no one yet
yeah that
that could be good yeah
hmm
uh
hmm
yeah are we gonna have time to make it display like a whole archive of meetings or is it just gonna be displaying single meetings and you'll hold up different ones
hmm
yeah the see at the moment the dialogue i d s just they start at zero for each meeting they don't run um continuously but you w you'd like them to run continuously
yeah i can change that
yeah just to change the index files as well
mm
do you want me to put a search in soon
no oh yeah
yes
yeah well we'll work on it yeah
hmm
yeah
mm hmm
yeah
hmm
yes we're gonna talk about the evaluation next week
yeah we could do that
yeah i think they're on the n l s s d  web page hmm

yeah
yeah probably as long as we need but yeah i don't know half an hour or some
yeah half an hour probably
hmm
yeah i think
yeah
hmm
yeah it may be a good idea to do that could we guarantee that it'd work
hmm
yeah i've been able to run it without yeah
hmm
mm hmm
yeah i'm sure he'll let us uh test it out before we do it
yeah dave see in the programme manager do you have a a method to like set the current i d  so it'll update the display 'cause that's what i'm gonna need when i'm uh like getting search results
hmm
right
yeah well as far as i've got at the moment i've made a results class that's got like the i d  and the stuff
yeah yep i'm well i'm working on it
right
i yeah and it might not be there i know i was thinking that might be a problem
hmm
hmm
yeah
w you could you could when it's when you're doing a search you could just like sort of zoom back out so you got the full text for that segment or that meeting rather than a summary 'cause that's maybe what you'd want if you were a user
you could provide that option
hmm
mm
hmm
alright yeah
so
we are here to talk about functional design now hopefully we've all got a better idea from than we did f leaving the last meeting as to what it is we are up to now
so here's an agenda uh i'll open um you should know that i'll be taking minutes
during all the meetings as i was struggling to our last time uh and that'll be easier for me now because i'm not actually
giving the whole presentation uh the additional points are just the stuff that we sent and that i forwarded on from upper
management having a few bright ideas to make our lives painful
um now you can all give your presentations we can talk about the requirements and hopefully come to some decisions right forty minutes for this meeting so a bit more time than the last one
here's the additional points i just wanted to put those in there to see if you guys had any comments
on them
uh did you all receive that email
so does anyone have any overall

mm
mm
yep
mm
well tha that first point could uh also be an op opportunity because in seeing that teletext is becoming outdated some sort remote control that can work with the internet there is the opportunity that's presented i guess
okay
okay
yeah but but we are sort of being dictated that this should only be for the television so we're quite fixed so we're really probably in terms of marketing are looking for that's uh that's a cost winner rather than a fantastic new feature product yeah
hmm
hmm
but there's also the potential for mark there's a market here for our lost teletext for example someone that just goes to the shop that wants a replacement wants it as cheap as possible twenty five euros is the selling price we really have to innovate here i guess
mm
k yeah
mm 'kay
okay
okay i think that the last point is probably quite uh straightforward obviously the the w it has to be branded
'kay
on the product yeah can you handle that black and yellow
mm
nah
so we have three presentations and i think we'll go in
order of participant number here
so we can have a look at the working design first from participant two that's
okay
mm it's enough but uh click it on off
do we have an idea of costs of different components
'kay
mm 'kay
do we have any ballpark figures for that yet no
'kay
yeah
okay
okay thanks
and we have participant three which i believe is pedro
i can give you that to click on
and you wanna get
view a slide show that's what you wanna do yeah just go up to view
mm 'kay

but i t i think what the the management recommendation was less that there's a worry that teletext will become outdated rather than we shouldn't have it so i i still think if it's cheap enough functionality wise to include it really should be in there
because otherwise we're just going to i mean even if it's necessary or not if you if you're given the choice
between a t a remote with teletext or without uh when it really if it i if it isn't
more expensive for us to k make because as far as i understand it it can be operated
with the same set of buttons yeah so it should be in there
yeah
okay isn't
well maybe what we're getting into here is the the idea of uh internet through the t v  for example so that might play on what we can do
well you have digital t v  still already
well there there is a for example on digital t v  systems you have you can press a button and you can buy things in adverts and you can uh you can view through a catalogue for example a a family member of mine has got a system where you just um you can
yeah and there's other features for example on other systems where you can pause live t v  and things like that they're just features from the internet
uh from computers are are coming into the t v  sort of under the covers but you still use it through a teletext so
now the things to think here are that that there's gonna be more functionality potentially that we can handle
mm
but still there there's an opportunity if if it's for example a trainable one then we're just simply having like an up down left right an okay button or something like that might might do as well in future proofing it

mm
okay
yeah and neither do i in fact
bu uh
i'll communicate that back to those guys there a a and th the message really we wanna be sending to them is that although teletext may become outdated w there's no l logic in not having it in there anyway
i if it doesn't affect the price um but i i think what they're pushing us towards here is in terms of thinking of ways to future proof our system for future systems that have something else other than teletext maybe i dunno i'm
mm 'kay
mm
yeah
hmm so if we're keeping it basic we're loo loo what we're looking to sell it basically is it's uh just being very easy to use looking exceptionally good that sort of thing 'cause we really don't have anything else there do we
mm hmm
but i if design if design is cheap and functionality is basic then twenty five euros is probably a high price for
a commoner garden stan standard t v  so the place uh remote the then the place we're going to
justify that cost is through through design through making it a a sleek elegant high priced
basic remote does that make sense huh
mm
yeah we probably should we we're doing alright for time
yeah
okay sorry that kinda cut into you there
mm
so we are looking for something that looks good and just works rather than looking for any special features is that
mm
but we can talk a little bit more potentially in the marketing marketing presentation about this be a good idea uh sorry i didn't mean to cut in i'm not the boss okay
i think that's probably a question more for
for this guy here yeah
is it okay
mm
hmm
okay
i have a question uh for you does any of the um the features
that pedro's spoken about here have any implications we might not have thought about on in terms of just pure
functionality in terms of making it work or the cost of that or
okay
'kay cheers
onto participant four
mm hmm
mm
yeah
now the the question is can we make this for less than twelve fifty per
we we well do we necessarily have to change the end cost because uh
can we dl can we do that without uh changing it twelve fifty per product if we basically can sell more based on this
mm hmm
yeah we we can certainly push for a more expensive product if that's gonna be
nah i think we can say with certainty now that we are supporting teletext
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm
mm
and and th to get to back to another point sorry uh uh for cutting in but i th i think it's important to remember that that this remote has to work with multiple t v s yeah 'cause it's selling on its own it's not going to be specifically for hitachi t v s or or whatever
so technologically if i understand it uh t v s t v  remote's working
exactly the same way as video remotes and d v d  remotes all you need to do is train them to the individual one all you need to do
is is know the the f like some four digit code so saying that it works with all t v s is equivalent to
saying that it'll work with d v d s and other things
oh okay okay we have done this
i see
mm hmm
and i i'd mm sorry
so we really can't chase that
we're really looking for something basic the the one thing that that that you said really struck a chord with me here in that we're we're
carrying the corporate identity with the product but we're actually looking for a large profit at the same time where i'd be inclined to go back to upper level
management and say like let's just cut down our profit expected on this product because we are actually branding our
company here we're selling more than just the product
we're trying to get mind share about uh real reaction to to the people who are gonna buy consumer electronics we want people to eventually say oh that's that's real reaction that's a good m make it's reliable
and and we're gonna make it we're gonna win mind share by uh either being a fantastic product or
for it working it just being good reasonable priced and solid so if we can make
if we can put an emphasis here on it not breaking i think that's in itself an extremely
big thing
we only have a few minutes left
is twenty five euros a mid market price for a remote okay
okay
well i'd be inclined to say if we can make the design better than any comparable remote while reducing the cost then that's the way we really should play it
if we can take it down to you know fifteen rather than twenty five and make a low profit margin on it but we're really doing that to sell the brand yep we have five minutes left
uh rather th uh to to to sell for real reactions and i can communicate this to to the more senior uh mm people within the company here to to get a reaction

well how does everybody feel i i think
the other the o the problem with that in my mind i just think off hand as a as a consumer would i wanna buy that and i think maybe not because i've got a remote and i'll take it to different chairs i'll take it to different i w i don't wanna go over somewhere and put it down
it i if it is gonna be somewhere that you put it down then it needs to be at the side of your armchair and that implies that there's only one t v  user so it's very good for some people but it's not a like
but it it takes away the ease of use of the remote to a certain extent you have to l sort of remember you have to d shift down the side of the couch to find it and put it back and
yeah i d i d i d i think it it in my mind it doesn't seem like something that oh i'd really want uh because of that fact but i i don't know that's just my opinion
mm
'kay
so what do we think maybe we should pedro do you have any opinion on it
really need to wrap up now
yeah
mm
yeah
i mean there's al there's also remote controls i remember that that worked uh this hasn't been done in a while i think but th
as a as a watch yeah there is remote control watches um but i think they're a sorta eighties thing
so it might not be easy to market in it uh but the the technologies came along and it might be cheaper to make now those
things may have been inexpensive for all i know

gotta cut up
mm
the last remote you'll ever buy
well if if we're going down that then we can we don't need to go the it it strikes me that the locator feature might actually be
uh quite expensive to make whereas actually just putting it in a power cradle might not be too expensive at all because that's
just done with mobile phones you can just n we we have said we have actually similar products that we can take from and potentially cut
costs there
um need to look into whether we can do that but uh i think we we have some m mobile phone based products uh checking quickly our internet we really need to finish up here but uh
yeah we have the the power adaptor products we sell power adaptor products so for example there's nothing stopping us
using that technology yeah

yeah i think so without it being too in fact we can cut costs through using the manufacturing that's already gonna be in place here
okay
yep
'kay thanks guys
yep
right
i think one of
i think w yeah one of the things that we should also keep in mind um when we're doing this i mean our company's slogan is
we put the fashion in electronics right so i think our kind of our target here is
to have some kind of very like sleek nice look remote and we want it to be functional
as well but i think one of the main selling points is that
we don't want it to be clunky like like this thing here you know we don't wanna a big clunker we want something that looks nice and it's fashionable and so
that's fine
okay so
so you all know me i'm the industrial designer
and we've some basic components that um our remote is gonna need just basically every remote'll need 'em we
need some kinda of power d power source um we have to decide on our our user interface which
is his department but the in user interface is also a major component um we need a programmable digital
signal processor to um to take the input from the user and translate that into
uh
into electronic signal which we pass to the infra red l e d  which you aim at the television uh which and it receives that signal
you need a on off switch um i don't know how that got in there and uh we also need to um
have the if we want a universal remote we need to have encryption codes for the different makes of t v s
so we need to know all the different you know all the different signals and so that'll require some memory
as well
um so here's just a basic layout of how how the remote would work
you ha the v the power source is in the upper right hand corner there and you can see that uh we have
the user interface here which is connected to the chip which does all our signal processing and then passes that signal
on to the infra red l e d  and that signal is then emitted and received by the television
at the photo transistor
so those are the basic components that need to go into this and everything else is pretty much uh open to move around
i think any des
no
right i think
yeah this is just this is just a basic layout of ev of all the components that w w are gonna
be absolutely necessary f to have a working remote we can add things in like if we wanted some voice recognition
i mean that i mean that you can kinda say would would fall under the user interface and
the digital signal processing chip but
um well the most the most costly components are gonna be the chip and the uh th it
could als basically the user interface and the casing are gonna be expensive as well um the l e d 
and the the transistors and everything else are you know they're they're pretty cheap
so depending on what we want our functionality to be um the chip could be expensive or it could be cheap um depending on the n amount of memory we need in there and stuff like that and h and h you know how much power
uh i don't have any figures right now we uh we have to wait until we get to a more specific design phase for
that um but and i think a significant part of the cost could be the actual
the actual casing itself and and you know the the b the buttons and things
like that i think
yeah basically yeah
so yeah that's all i have really
click don't yeah
mm hmm
right as far as i it's just uh the cost of an extra button i mean software wise there's really no difference i think
scheduling
um to find out what what you're watching even if there's commercials you know
i think i ha
i agree
well for me
yeah
unless you have a
yeah
mm hmm
i think a lot of that's proprietary anyways you're not gonna be able to you like command a tivo with our remote i don't think
i think if it's possible you should try to you know have a talk with management about that just you know
right it's just not yeah
well
right i'm just thinking you know with all these universal remotes that are out there how many people how
many people actually use every feature that ar you know i like these trainable
remotes and things like that where you know it's just so confusing to do to use
all these functions where
i think the largest portion of the market is just gonna you know they lost their t v  remote they need another one that'll work with their t v 
they want something that looks nice that that that isn't gonna break when they drop it that you know that
maybe it's it's ergonomic it feels good in your hand something like that i think that's gonna be where
you're gonna find the biggest you know market share
i think the more bells and whistles we add it's just gonna cut into our into our profits because i think as we as we
add costs for things like uh for like if we add the voice recognition and things like that
i think you know what percentage of the of the um of the market is actually gonna use that
maybe five percent you know and how much
right
yeah okay i'm sorry
sorry boss
yeah well it's kinda both of us us us user interface
mm hmm
i was thinking about that
then your lights would go off though
yeah
right
i don't
i think all these things are pretty standard i think we'll be okay
mm you can just click
no no no you just get off that you just click anywhere
i have an idea and it's kind of along the s lines of environmentally sensitive and it may even fit into ergonomics and even kind of address the issue of losing losing the remote what we were saying it's a common issue
um what we can do is well you know that batteries throwing a aw remotes run through batteries like crazy
right and s for some people yeah well maybe not a solar remote but instead what
about if we had like a power cradle like a a cradle that is is there to hold the remote when you're not
using it so you'll always know where the remote is 'cause you have to put it back there to charge the remote
and we can instead of having instead of having you know replaceable batteries we'll just have a power cell that stays there for the life of the remote you never have to get go through the go through uh all these different batteries
and also you can i i think it's a good opportunity for the user design or for
not just for the user design but also for the just for the look and feel of the remote as as a whole
you know you could have some kind of neat little you know a sexy design for
d a cradle and the remote itself
it w it would increase the cost
and you could page the remote if you lose it maybe there's a button on the cradle
well
what i can do is i can d look into ho well pedro and i can look into how much this might increase our our costs and you can look into what kind of effect an increased cost is gonna have on our on our final numbers
i i
yeah
i just don't know about that because in order to do that in order to price it at that kind of level i think we'd need to
have every functionality that all the other competitors are offering like being
able to operate you know the d v d  player and you know the stereo system and all that which is a pretty basic
function that w we've opted out of and additionally we're m maybe not supporting teletext
um
but i do think there are some basic features that we don't have that a lot of other remotes are going to have
mm hmm
i don i i d i have to disagree though i think our market niche is basically people who need
who have lost their remote or uh who've broken their remote and don't wanna send back to the manufacturer they just
wanna run out to the store and get a remote and then they're gonna look on the shelf and they're gonna see ours is the nicest looking remote it does what they need
these aren't i i think that it
right
right
mm hmm
right
well here's
right
we he well here's my thing about that if you're in the market for this ultimate remote
you're not gonna go for just a television remote if it can't control if it can't control your
your d v d  player and a al if y if you can't get that all in one ultimate remote that just you can throw all
your other remotes away i'm not gonna buy a d seventy five euro remote
so i think what we so that's what i'm saying
mm hmm
i think that's big
i think so yeah
yeah
what about um the idea that i had with the cradle how do you feel about that
or how does everybody feel
no but i that's the thing i i don't think it's necessarily the other end
mm hmm
right
well it lasts it would last for several hours on its own power but when you're done with it you put it back in the cradle
yeah well it
mm hmm
mm hmm
well the the problem with that is we may end up with a whole bunch of inventory of a of a poor design you know so
um but what we could do is some kind of well i mean
yeah we we need to i mean have a few designs to look at and then come up with something that
i think we all agree is you know the best fit i think w what's really important is it has to
look good it has to feel it has to feel good in your hand it has to be durable it has to a and i
think it's really important that it doesn't look cheap i think i think we have to make sure
people look at it an and feel like it its like a quality remote even though the cost may be low
mm hmm
or what if it looks like a pen
yeah
a pointer
yeah
yeah
so
just to touch on m my point one last time that i had brought up um i really
un unless you guys are die hard against the fact that um it's possible like it reduces
the usability of the remote b and the fact that you can't lose it on your own
i think it still might be a good idea to investigate having like a power cradle
because i really think i in a certain sense it almost like for me i would want to have that just because i
know at the end of when i'm done watching t v  that when i'm done oh i better go find the remote and put it back where
it belongs maybe th th th that's just some people that like that a lot of people
as a watch mm 'kay
mm hmm
that's what i was saying
exactly
mm hmm
mm hmm
and also presumably they've
exactly
yeah
true
right
yeah the locator'll definitely be more expensive
mm hmm
right
right i think one of the things that we can put right on the box is never buy another battery you know something like that


yeah bu but we we're designing only the remote we not design the t v  so uh we're gonna be removing the teletext out of any t v 
that we people use our remote with
so it's kind of a stupid decision

so then the double r  will be our our
i tho i tho i thou
i think rol ro rolls royce might mind but don't worry
yes

i
hey mouse open
when we're fighting over it's also more lot more fun
uh
this doesn't work so yeah function design um you guys know me pedro and um
what i found is we want to do fashion and i think honestly
we should keep technology low and just simple basically and try to aim for design
if basically a case will will cost the same if it looks good or bad
so we ma we have to make it look good um something cute and small the big chunky remotes are died in the eighties so we should just go for something that people will like to actually look at
and um although mo most people will buy s
televisions and everything for uh that have loads of loads of little functions and everything and they
mostly end up using simple functions and little things and most the people won't won't get too
mad of actually having to go the to the s to the television to for instance tune in their
the stations there's no need to have that in the remote so um
um as for what i would recommend for uh the the interface design and uh i will change
the colours on the on the logo but um we should go for the user oriented
device so simple controls and good ergonomics um and uh although i th i th
i'm still here recommending the teletext so i'll remove that i guess but um we should
go for the
yeah
yeah the they're basically aiming at saying that you would use you know a couple of years ago teletext to be the easiest way to check like for uh uh the scheduling and the next programme and stuff like that and now
yeah and now you can c look it over internet but i still think teletext is way more convenient until until we have the same commodities
yeah but it's not happen yet yeah
yeah but we we don't we're not aiming a command for that that's the thing and all of those require the other commands with more complexity and more software and
yeah but we would increase the price to try to make it a trainable one so
well i dunno one way the other teletext was there but i guess we can remove it or you know make two separate interface designs
yeah
yeah

yeah
yeah
yeah but we're not putting some there's no no putting anything in in the place of teletext that's the problem
yeah
no just i i would i would advocate for continuing teletext and those would be the basic commands um
as for you know the the case design uh maybe i'll come up with more concrete ideas right now it's just the idea
of simplicity and slickness cute and small um
yeah
yeah mm

mm hmm

but we th that should be design
that should be the design basically i think technology we'd we we're not in the price range to do it
we don't have the money to do it towards t f technology so we should we should aim at design yeah yeah


mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah y y you you wouldn't
the interface will be different

good design
uh we should keep it simple mm medium low cost mar um cost area and uh make it look good

yeah complicated but
yeah
okay
okay yeah
yeah they are not simple
yeah
yep
yeah
well uh what comes up for me is that if we're gonna if we're gonna be marketing a product that is going
to be uh having no teletext people are very comfortable with
the idea of having teletext and using teletext and so we're not we're gonna be
a new product without something that people are very comfortable having right now
so that's from a marketing perspective i i see i see a lack and so we have to go i think in the other direction what are we gonna have that makes this thing better than

right yeah no i i agree with you so what i'm talking about is i see that one side we're eliminating something so
we have to come up with another side which is what are we gonna be targeting our market uh that identifies our product as
better than because it doesn't have teletext it has ta ta ta ta ta so that's that's that was my reactions
yeah yeah
yep
okay
yeah 'kay
that's right i think we take with you
that's what i'm that's what i'm talking about is is that we have to find something that is gonna be very attractive about this product 'cause
somebody some people are gonna be hap unhappy 'cause it took they can't ac access their teletext okay
'cause we're talking about eighty percent or ninety percent or ninety five percent of the televisions out there are are teletext
so so it's it's not that i'm criticizing the product at all it's just when we eliminate that then what do we bring what are we bringing in to take the place of this and we have to d in my opinion we have to double up if we lose one we need to bring two or three
so you have this
now is would this be considered just a standard uh um
this is not this is not cutting edge technology we're talking here we're talking about existing technology nothing is being modified or upgraded or new discoveries
okay okay
n okay
mm
mm the shell
okay

i have maybe a silly question i in the very beginning it said with the with the advent of computers there's gonna be
the it's gonna be out moded teletext i i don't understand how those two things are connected how does how does computers
and teletext h how why is one eliminating the need of the other i don't understand that
okay
yeah 'cause yeah i just i don't see the cross over between computers and television i mean i do see the cross over in some sense but
but but but with the the remote is is used for television okay so so if we make the cross over and we're gonna view television
on computers then we're then we're losing the the necessity of the remote s
okay
okay
yeah i don't i don't see the logic i i don't see the logic in elimination of teletext i just i i but i'm not a tech mind either i just don't see the cross over between computers and and and 'cause we are designing something for a television okay
we are selling it to an existing market
that's
yeah and and yeah and and we're also marketing a product it's what i'm seeing is a is a mid range cost product so
so w we can't go and pump a whole bunch of technology into this thing because all of a sudden we are gonna have cost overruns
so if we drop if we are gonna choose to drop teletext again what are we adding to the product that makes it marketable
i don't i don't see it and to me if i'm gonna market a product for b for beauty for for design i'm
gonna i'm gonna try to market it at a much higher price i need to make it special with a high price tag i don't want to make it economically
uh g uh competitive i want i want to market it as exclusive so i would market this product it at eighty nine
euros and come up with some really beautiful exterior design or something th but
but i don't think we have that flexibility
no i no i i understand what you say but what i'm what i'm okay we probably need to move along but my my concern
is trying to find a marketing niche for this product and if i'm coming in with a with with twenty five euros which is mid market
price um then what am i going to give these people for this so that's just my
question but we can keep talking
yeah
oh p pedro i just want to say quickly i i would really like it when you can come up with some more bells and whistles eh
you know sell uh things come to my mind is uh uh something that's uh um voice activated i know we're getting into some i hope some big money on this thing but
is that for over here okay alright
that's
'cause uh and i think of voice activated i think of of how many times i've i've lost my my remote
and i can't find it so some way that i can i can find my remote by clapping my hands or something
uh and and so so um but this 's just something i'm trying to find some bells and
whistles 'cause when they talk about tel taking out teletext it's like what are we gonna put in what makes this thing attractive and it's only for
televisions
so we everyth our our competition out there has got these these multiple adaptors where they can use 'em for
their v c r s their d v d s their their televisions and we're coming out with one remote for television
only and so to me we have to make this a really special product i i i don't s i really have to say i don't see the market
niche for this product at this price i don't see it yet i'm i i go along with this because this is what we're given to try to market
but i i don't see the market niche for this product
without without some really sort of something really special to identify it as as unique in the market
yeah
okay
have to do you have to do it in the box okay well so so that's up to you then to to make this box in something that's absolutely extraordinary
maybe make it in the form of a gun we can sell it in united states
well you know for marketing f marketing for me is uh and uh how do i go here okay
go go is that right
ah ha yeah what for me is it um i d i don't know what i'm marketing right
now okay 'til you spoke and when i wrote this i don't know what i'm marketing i just know that i i was identified
as a a we identified ourselves as a as a developer as a manufacturer and as
a as a um distributor t to other wholesalers
and so the th the twenty five euros that we've identified as the sale price is
a wholesale price rather than a retail price that's what we decided here um
so what i did is i i decided that that this this needs to be a product in
a in a sense can market itself so what we've identified here as our main marketing stratagem
is is in design
we're making the most beautiful attractive uh whatever we decide it is so that means we have
about seven more minutes or ten minutes left um so i would
like to have a product that that we can sell easily so i say inspiration so having something beauty
something attractive uh something that in a sense will sell itself uh innovation i think
fits into what we're talking about here with design uh cutting edge technology i don't think we're gonna have that these
were ideas i was putting together
um unless we come up with some new age product a as far as the casing
is concerned i i wanna make this thing something that i can identify as special in some way
so maybe we can have some i i talked about environmentally sensitive uh maybe we have a product that can be identified
in some way as advantageous in a home i don't know these are just thoughts
uh i wanted to talk about uh who we are as a as a corporation that we're new we're aggressive
we're competitive we're we're trying to provide a product from a new perspective rather than
from an old corporate line so to me it's about selling d uh our identity our corporate
identity along with the product
um what i found is that the projected costs are competitive
uh we're kind of in the middle of the market but what i'm seeing is that the market is ready for i i identified new
technology but again because what i see is budget restrictions and limitations i don't know that we can bring any
new technology into this thing if if we could have a technological something
mm p please
solar
but solar

blah i like it i like the idea but we're talking about in cost is gonna probably double
but boy we can sell this thing because there's no batteries it's environmentally sensitive i we can identify it as a safer product in some form
yep that's right i really see but the cost i
no no no no we have t we have to change the end cost there's uh i mean i don't see it anyway
yeah that's gonna be up to these guys i my reaction is no but
well see i i see i i'm an advocate to make this an exclusive product you know let's let's sell this wholesale
for for fifty euros sixty euros let's make this thing really exclusive environmentally sensitive
uh high tech design uh ergonomics all of this just make this thing uh yeah the
the the rolls royce of of remote controls
every home's got to have it if you don't have one hey what kind of remote do you have oh you've got one of those oh fantastic i want one of those too i just don't have enough money right now


yep one one thing i don't understand is h they've they've given us this package okay now uh
in my opinion we need to give them a package back okay they say they say okay here you go they gave us a fundament a foundation
of of what they want and and w it's our place to kinda analyse and evaluate i don't think it's our place to
create their product for them maybe it is i don't know what kind of role we have in this in the corporate ladder uh
but to me it's like okay you have got your here's our ideas okay
and then let them look at those ideas and they say yeah well we can we can raise the price twenty percent you know
we like this idea this idea no but to me it's it's about a choice do we follow their directives or
do we make uh presentations back and and then and then discuss
beca i i do not i do not see the market niche for the product that they're handing f handing us right now i don't see it
right
no i understand that

nope they've identified the product as not working for anything but televisions they've identified this product limita that's why i say
i don't i don't see the market niche for this if we if w if we were going to have a product that worked for d v d s
v c r s and everything then i can see the market niche but we we're only identified as going for televisions
without teletext and it's like whoa we ha in my opinion we have to go with something that's extremely exclusive
to make this thing marketable because who wants just a television remote i don't
that's right

i i i have a tendency to agree with you i really do that's why i say i quest i q i question the marketability of the product i really question where we create the demand
w okay if you if you drop the cost now if you make if you make go to the other side of the cost scale and you make it less expensive
then all of a sudden now we're going into an a a new market area so we can say low cost uh
uh um uh good design beautiful wa da da da da da but what i'm saying is right now we're
middle market

yeah for for multi for a multi function remote that's a mid market price in a discount right now you can buy 'em on sale sometimes
for about about uh eighteen nineteen euro and that's for the multi functions
uh d v d  v c r  uh catch alls and and they have 'em in a little box in the middle
and and this is the consciousness that most people have about replacement remote controls so
to me to market this a t only a television remote control we have to change consciousness
we have to have something that will change people's thinking to identify this as advantageous and i don't know what that is it's gotta be low cost or high cost with with special design features
or my d
i mean i i well we g we're talking about the other end now i like it i like the idea but we have t we have to find out
well
mm
well i think again it's it we have a cost issue here you know if we're gonna go in this direction to me we're going to the other
side of the cost range are we gonna make this selling selling the cost as a high high tech uh um
environmentally sensitive whatever or are we gonna go to the lower side of the range again i don't
see our market niche in the middle for our product yet i don't see it yet
w a question i have in in a 'cause i i i think i agree with you on we gotta make it a box the box is gonna sell it i think the outside the casing can can can we have multiple designs
have a modern have a traditional have a you know and so so instead of them all looking the same people can have maybe four or five different designs they can choose from i don't know what that creates cost or
yep one over another yeah okay i hear that
what ab what ab what about a
a remote that's that doesn't maybe look like a remote
just an idea just just okay 'cause i mean we all know what a remote looks like on the outside they're selling these things everywhere maybe that could be part of our design exclusivity is we make a remote that doesn't even look like a remote it it opens like a telephone
doesn't matter yeah i'm just jus i talking about some something to make this thing unique it that's the thing i'm gonna keep thumping on
i'll sell whatever you guys design i don't have a problem selling a product that's not the issue i give you ideas you guys create the
product once you have the finished product i'll find a way to sell it don't worry about it i just give you these things now because these are
my thoughts and feelings
no no
one thing i just thought about when you were saying that is that the p our target market is gonna be someone who has lost
or broken we gotta stop who's lost or broken their their remote so how
many remotes do they wanna buy can we p can we sell them a remote that can maybe guarantee they will
not need to buy another one and so with with with this kind of system or locator or something
to to think about how have people been been losing or breaking their remote how does this happen
and and then and then design the product maybe some component of the product that can identify this as the last one you'll ever need to buy
uh we can make it in the shape of a coffee pot
it's uh just it's that i think it's telling us to stop our meeting so we have the c we probably have have on line in our in our system we have the ability to create this we're talking about
a charging system
if if we can create this we have probably five or six or seven really strong marketing characteristics
no that's not what i want i want
oh look it here
hmm
it's with cameras
you look quite funny at the moment tim
nice

mm yes
yes perhaps yeah but i mean they're all very very similar all those x m l  files i had um a look at the um for example a s 
mm
take mozilla
yeah i think that would be m i mean uh for me it's quite difficult to say o on
you know w um what scope one annotation would have
i think it would be certainly more than one word and
i think it would work best with utterances or segments
yep
i think just the segments as they're segmented in the for example in the point se point six five
i think so
and you would s probably still need um your values for the words um perhaps for for um the keywords that are displayed
when you click on something
yeah but that's another representation then i think f for the importance measure
should yeah
um po
yes
no it's not it's um for example there's uh b d b o o  one c  point six
uh i can't see anything very much but yeah that's that's it
can you use a bigger font

okay so here there's for um each segment um uh that's really all segments i mean it's it can be words or topics or um anything i think
um that's why th it's for example time provenance dialogue act or time provenance segment or time provenance
no but it yeah
yeah it p oh well some of them point to the words other others point to the um dialogue acts so that's kind of the global thing that ties together other things
um
yeah they have their nite i d  the time
the segment is what is displayed in one line um by nite
yeah it looks uh uh the segment thing looks in the into the words x m l  file and the dialogue acts
um thing yeah i think it's in a different
um
no their their annotation of dialogue acts and one um segment can have or one um of those word strings that are presented in one line can have several um dialogue acts annotated on it
that's why
yeah it's from words
yes
that's just below
but i think these segments are perhaps not exactly what we are looking at because that's just o one tying all the others together
and the information or r i mean we are going to create a file that looks more like um the words file
i think
yes
yeah they are
um to discourse marker dis f  marker fi point five
yeah that's there no no up up go up yeah right
yeah this is all the speaker d 
you and the speaker d 
yes um you can see whether there's somebody else or not you can see that in the w um w  point um
first it's w  point um five uh fifty four and then it's seventy six so there
are um this number of utterances of other speakers in between
yeah i think we would also need two of those
yeah i think we would have to have the same structure one that points to it where we tie together all our information so we would perhaps have to make one that's similar
yes and uh then another one that would perhaps give the actual probability value
yeah it could could probably be in the same file i don't know
but if you have several layers then
you can't represent them on the same file
yeah in segment point one um there line below
yeah that's what i meant actually yeah
mm hmm
um
but i i mean there's not all the information that is in in the c corpus in there in the
segments file i think that is just the um things that are loaded every time but we have lazy
loading so it can load more than that perhaps we could just try to
cope um you know to
make our file one of those lazy loaded but i mean i've no real idea how that works
yeah but yes but it has um you know a basic thing that it loads i think so for example every time it loads the segment things it can't it can't not display words i think
and it eras
i think so
that's how i understood it
because otherwise in the in the other things there is no information about what the participant name is and so on so
in the segments file it's really the very basic that have to be displayed for any thing

yeah i thin i mean it wouldn't be difficult to um create a file of the p sh of that shape i mean that would be no problem
um yeah i i don't know how about you with your words but um for my segments
were the um f  zero measurements and all those values i get from there um i
always store the beg uh start and end time of everything i calculated there so
i would just have to pu put it uh yes
yeah it is
uh actu but actually my segments are not always the same as their segments because and their segments there are um pause um pauses sometimes a
um yes but uh yeah i mean one segment of theirs is sometimes two segments of mine that's just what i meant
yeah but for example i made a file that contains just the um start times it could contain
end times and words for all speakers of all meetings i mean that's just the same thing as i gave yeah
as i gave to you but um uh displaying also a start and end times of
every word so you could perhaps use it to match um it with your additional information you got
couldn't you
perl a perl script yeah
no no
mm yeah
but would you then not get the typical words for every speaker if you
because it would then say how it find that it's that speaker
yeah
it's probability yeah or or value yeah
so could you put the more information back in then
yeah but the topic isn't it that's a topic information
mm hmm
yeah
so how sure or unsure you are about the what's following our b our context measures yeah
yeah
but do we have enough informa enough data for that it gives us sensible things
because i mean the the words we're look really looking for appear not too often and
if they appear five times in the meeting and they have each time a different you know
differ some different surrounded words perhaps we have not enough data
i don't understand what you
yeah okay
mm hmm
but that would give the same value for one word every time i mean for for a specific word yeah because then it would be quite easy to re integrate it into such a
okay but then it would also be possible to re integrate it it would be more dif i mean it would be a bit more work but then
yes
um and what well what score would a word get that just occurs once in all the corpus for example
even though there are all the other same topics where it doesn't occur
mm hmm
so would it be higher scored than a word that um occurs
in
every um sequence of the same topic
yeah i mean um we have uh s uh our several topics for example we have twenty topics and um for one of these topics there are five occurrences and we have one word that
yes but across meetings um there will be the same topic several times
ah it wasn okay i thought that was what you were doing
yeah but
yeah but you make also um segment similarity i think that was i i thought that would
and they they are not related then to other blocks of
okay i um
oh okay
i misunderstood that then
so yeah how would it work i mean what would
um the his information then be useful for in r rainbow
um i thought the point about that was that we would put um into s um serial categories all the segments of the same topic across meetings
okay
yeah but but then it does okay

mm hmm
mm
mm
yep
yeah mm yeah
yes yeah i mean i haven't really decided on uh how to
really get the information out of this now because um when i have for example
um increased speaker overlap that applies to several turns of course but i could
give um the information about yeah how how important this is to
each of those segments
yeah pros um but you proposed um we we should break that down to have um
the smallest um smallest um unity um of time
duration should be one word i mean that would be because that would be what
naturally came out of her thing and
yeah sure but i could then if i if i have um the value for a segment i would perhaps just give all the
important wor or mm yeah no
yes
mm hmm
yeah i would say that someone have to break it down aye
i would probably somehow have to break it down to to that level yeah
yes sure
yeah probably somehow it should work that way
yeah but then okay but th at that moment it would be better for me to just make it on a per segment basis right way and let her adapt it also to the segment basis
yeah
yeah i mean mine are only more but they have the same start and end point sometimes they're two segments and one with a gap in between but um the have um th th they don't overlap
no no they don't but um
um
they're i mean my segments overlap in the same way as theirs do but sometimes i
have um split one of the segments into two segments but it's easy to match
the start and end times to map it to their segments
i uh hope so yeah
mm hmm yeah
that would be quite difficult but yeah
yeah i mean that's what i'm already doing with my s uh separate
yeah it's tells you even which words it is

yep should be possible
yep
yeah i hope to have some value quite soon but um i just worked um
i mean i just calculated the values values for um the average f  zeros
and um they're what's c i mean i didn't have a look at the data yet but um they
vary quite widely even for the same speaker across meetings so one speaker
had um an average of about a hun one hundred um in one meeting and
one hundred sixty in another meeting that's really that's strange i mean perhaps it's because of laughter
or something that's what i was thinking but i didn't have
i'll probably look at it
yeah that's what i read in one of those papers uh as well but
yeah but it could mess up things quite considerably
yeah but uh ar yeah but all this is quite you know data intensive
i when i um let the um just calculate the average f 
zero levels it i think it needed more than half an hour considerably more than what have half an hour f
to delay it for our meetings because um yeah m i mean we have seventy
five hours per yeah av average of six speakers and they're measured every
o  point o  one six seconds and that gives us quite a lot of values
yeah what i did at the moment is um i um yeah i got the f  zero values
from for each speaker for his headphone and i only take those um
the w uh that were recorded at the time where he was actually speaking and for those
i calculated um the average
zero so that gave me um now one value per speaker per meeting
no no that's just the average no that i yeah
yes i mean i r just uh needed to have this value now to relate um m how yeah
yeah i think yeah
um amusement and so on is yeah
yeah i i i mean it i actually have to look at the data what causes these um
because it's quite funny to have a m male speaking at two hun two hundred um
yeah sure but


mm hmm
yeah and i am at the moment fiddling around with my data and not quite seeing how i get to a sensible abstraction level you know from my very
yeah
yeah so i mean you will be happy with some data even if it doesn't make much sense
try uh try yeah mm hmm
yeah if it's already on segments base that's not too much


hmm
this isn't supposed to look like just
ah sod that okay there
group k  da
yeah
yeah i guess whatever
it's yeah i never get this so what's the point of if this is strapless if this strap's supposed to go behind m i obviously doing this wrong obviously failing this like whatev calling centre and tra
like this and then yeah you know what the shit has to do now
okay
yes so um actually i just realise i don't have power let me just switch on the other which is gonna run out
okay
so there's probably not much to talk about at the moment in terms of like talking about each other's stuff i mean beyond what we've been talking about yesterday
so what i've been thinking is maybe if we try to really make sense together of the x m l  format
to be sure that we can all produce the data that we are producing in a way or at least
i mean i guess my data i'll probably load in from completely different way anyway because it's matrix
but all this stuff that goes with annotation that we have it in the right format maybe if we just sort of pool what we know about
the x m l  format and try to make sense of it i don't at all know how to go about this
um what i did just now is i downloaded
um i downloaded some
files some x m l  files and
i was thinking if we maybe just should go through some of them and like try to see if you understand the general structure and
pool together what we think about the structure what we think that things mean and then talk about how the
annotation for information density and stuff should maybe be structured in a similar way
or but i don't r i don't really have an idea like what other words what we would do today in this meeting i mean
what's that part
mm hmm
mm hmm

yes so does anyone have a good idea where to start like which what so what is it we talk about getting in at the moment we're basically
just 'cause the two of you will merge your data together right in some way like i in the end it'll result in one annotation
so the only thing we're trying to tie in is just an additional annotation which is similar to
the annotation about what what would it be s most similar to simply to the segmentation information or
okay
i'm not sure it ah see that's what i was thinking not sure what software i have at the moment which would be hello
um
yeah
ah
does anyone know any good standards software displays x m l  i'm not sure
yeah but i'm afraid i only have firefox and firefox doesn't have the nice x m l  viewer anymore
i think i don't have mozilla
no
i can probably just emacs them
but
but going from from a word business wouldn't it be easier to then go back and calculate for each utterance
you know wha wha each turn so if we
yeah

so d
does anyone does anyone know in which file the actual like what's it called the splitting into the utterances
is is called is that
is it
what does it end with does it with with sax
does that look like it
okay
be nice
let's actually just see if maybe k  right
oh this is how much time you spend just getting the right software going
is that better to see i guess yeah white and black is better to see
so just see if i can view
okay
so
this this
but what is this i mean this doesn't contain any content like any text
oh wait somebody s s somebody explain that slowly to me so
so what do all these things in this file have in common what what are they
no but w like uh so they are they are segments in what sense wh what's definition of a segment then
okay and
and that's usually dialogue what what's difference i between provenance dialogue act and between segmenter i don't
a dialogue act uh a dialogue act annotations of dialogue act so is that just another representation of text
just see can we have this files somewhere so the stuff that's
that's called segment here that do we know which file this is pulling from
from yeah it's it's c it from words x m l  is that it's saying here
let me see if i have that words x m l  file so let's for example look at
okay let me just try to get them all to a different screen
uh uh is that what we were
sorry i'm just i'm trying to arrange them so that we have one above the other so to make some sense of that
so no here we had
um i'm just trying to understand what this segments file is about like it's it's referencing here it's referencing to
to a certain position in the in the words file
so it's that non vocal sound one here that's the mic noise okay
but what's the does it always just oh no it's it's referencing to several word structures so this would be basically be a a sequence right
so that's from w  fifty two
are they not ordered or oh yeah from w  fifty two down to w  what are we talking about and yeah w sorry
okay so this so this is somebody saying it it doesn't
do we have any confirmation do we actually see from this file who's doing it just out of interest
oh sorry in speaker d 's file so this is where he'd like time stops and then it only starts at a later time because oh you don't see when i'm pointing at screen it's just for this so then it starts here this time against speaker d  because in between there's somebody else
okay
yeah okay
okay so the the file with annotations for information density what would that be like would that be like the segments file giving a start word and end word or or would that
how would that be to best tie in with the system
sorry
something like something like this or like where you give sort of a reference to a beginning and an end position
well that would be in the same file wouldn't it it would just couldn't we have a like uh
i guess we could introduce a different um
we have for now if we just do something which for every
segment in here attaches actually can we not tie it to the segments file would that not be the way how they would want it to have to do as if we in the end if we want to attach to each of those segments one number for now
and those segments have uh do they have an i d  yeah i guess they do so this is the i d  of a specific segment right
yeah so wouldn't it i mean the problem is they've me haven't looked at the exact inner workings of their of their engineered but you'd think that the easiest way and the way that how it's intended to be would be just
if we have here a link to the segment a like an i d  for that segment that we just create another file which links to the segment and then has an additional value which is the number
yeah yeah
yeah oh sorry i i thought we were talking about having two files
i was think yeah i i think that i i understood wrong i thought you were wanting to have two different x m l  files with one the reference and
one just th just the number and i was thinking that's probably what you meant just um having
like for each sort of of our segments having just the i d  which is referencing to these segments here and
another attribute which is the the value
so this whole information we would then store in this ah no that i don't have access to because i didn't download like there's
this one meta information file where it describes the structure of all the files and describes which um which attributes
they bring in so we would add that to that file
saying that sort of we bring in information density and then we would create the file of that type which we probably couldn't call it segment i'm not sure we probably might have to have a different word for it i'm not sure if it there's any trouble with it repeating
in the existing segments file
yeah i reckon actually if we make a copy of it
what uh what are you saying about the w i th doesn't the lazy loading apply to everything i mean that it sort of dynamically loads
you think it i it l it loads the whole of the segments file every time
okay
the segment at the moment is split up over
hmm
no but i think it's too early to really like discuss that in detail because we don't at all understand at the moment how the internal
data structure like how the loading works so maybe if we g if we go ahead do you think it would be
possible for you to do an like something like segments or maybe just a copy of segment which has an attribute for for each segment
um but it is like with a with a value with a density value
would it be easier though because all your methods are sort of not working with their whole time frame structure there so would it be easy for you to to tie the things together like if you're doing it on on the word basis here with those words that in the end you then tie it back in into the right segment here i mean
you probably have to do a bit of
hmm
you're doing it time based at the moment so this isn't directly having time references but you can get the oh it is actually here
okay so if you slice it up by time you'd probably be able to just like attach like just some attribute of
info val just f to each of those segments
mm hmm
'kay um i don't understand enough of what their data structure is this probably would be a lot easier would i really understand how they are handling the data internally 'cause then we c then i could say oh it's easy to just tie it in if you just have it time stamped that just reference by words and stuff
but t at the moment
so you would you're doing i you're doing a word by word base
mm hmm
okay
but every word does does the word picking like does it always have the same information value in your thing i does it depend on its position like
it be d depends on the position
hmm
and you're doing this via some software that's like external software so you can't
so what if you if you if you get the results from that software and you go back over it then with that file sort of you write an algorithm which which then goes back because they they're in the right order still and stuff right so that shouldn't be a problem oh but this is by speaker here which makes it slightly more difficult
the problem is that actually nite x m l  probably provides a lot of the tools that we'd need to do that
in in a temporal sequence
but but would the information density algorithm still make any sense if you split them up because i mean the whole i thought the whole thing is that
you look at the frequency of a word in that specific how often a word inc occurs in a certain topic versus how often
it occurs over the whole corpus and that from that it calculates
mm hmm
yeah i have a gut feeling it's not a good idea to split it
yeah no but i mean it can't be that difficult if you if you already have you have in the right order all the words with a with a score to them and you have a file which has each word and a time stamp so those two tied together have each word and its time and
and and and its proba and its value yeah
so they're they're at the moment so
it appears to me that rainbow was made for something quite different
hmm
i actually like um um i are you actually sure that rainbow is doing a measure like is returning a measure of what we are trying to measure 'cause it it seems to me that it's just it sounds like something quite different in in d many aspects
mm hmm
and w
yeah
yeah
but where do you have the original category information from
yeah
yeah
so where do you where do you have them from at the moment the split up
in i in the t in the topics in the in the human topic s um so you've split them up by topic at the moment
yeah but
okay okay okay 'cause i was just thinking that doesn't make sense at all but yeah if you if that's just while you're waiting
okay have you ever like looked into different ways of calculating 'cause i was just thinking like i mean the
for example the the infor um what's it called the entropy calculation is that she boxed
it under the simple calculation that you could probably write the script in no time at all and
yeah but i'm also just like i think that probably the entropy value at the moment for a word is closer to what we're at the moment
looking for i can just like k k i can sit together with you for twenty minutes and just show
you the entropy code that i wrote for my other project and it probably and we should work together because it's we
used t we have to we'd use the same matrix as i'm using in my latent semantic analysis you'd use to calculate entropy scores
and then we'd have um a score which actually which would be the same for
the word in each position so in that sense it's doing something a bit different and like w basically the score that i'm
talking about is a conditional entropy score which just checks how much information the fact that there's
one word tells you about what would be the next word but that's a relatively good measure of whether that's a very specific word in which case
they are usually words which tell you quite a lot or a very general word which usually doesn't tell you quite a lot
um it it's basically the it's the standard entropy formula and you sort of you you
yes yes it has i mean i think the official le sort of the official description of what it tells you is um how
much that like the fact that a given word occurs tells you about what's the next word's gonna be which doesn't sound too exciting
but it it just works out in the way that words which are promiscuous and which occur with everything all over the place have very
low a scores on that and also usually end up being the words which are p
least like expressive and l contain less information
yeah function words or just very general nouns pr probably like what whatev for example the word computer in that context you could imagine it to f like be in all in all the contexts
yeah so we would we w wouldn't do it by word we would sorry okay um i was i was getting that w actually sorry i was getting that wrong i was getting it from what i did my project now in this case we would do it by per mee words per meeting
so
hmm
yes it it's probably doing it's probably doing quite the same thing in the end but i'm just saying like with that thing you would easily have an algorithm which at the moment provides you for each word with a score which we can use
um no um i was i was i was describing the wrong thing in this case we wouldn't be doing how much it tells you about another word in this case we would be doing given that you know a word how good is it at predicting from which um specific topic that was
so that would yeah in that sense it's the same thing here
yeah yeah for a specific
yeah
the same word the word yesterday would be would have the same score all over the place
okay
i c
but but your category thing depends on that we not just have topic segments but also that these topic segments we have them in categories
you you do wouldn't you need several documents for each category or several segments for each category
do but will it word without that at all
'cause
yeah i mean s so in our case basically every
every s topic would be its own category
and the question is does the algorithm still make any sense in that i don't understand the algorithm enough for that but what i'm
really like because the entropical um calculation is so simple maybe we should look into making that
score just as a preliminary score that we have like it it's a very it gives you like i've looked
at the result it gives you basically something in the end which vaguely tells you just whether a word is a very specific word
or a very general word
and
i like there is some hope that probably having just sentences where there's lots of very specific words if you mark them as being more interesting than the words which are only very general words that they would get us somewhere
probably one point zero is very high information value
yeah 'cause this would
yeah in in a sense i mean this is a bit like the what like document frequency over total frequency
measure it sort of just going by
what do you mean every sequence of the same
mm hmm
within th within the topic so like topic we had to when you say topic you mean like just like from from a beginning to end point like within one meeting there are several topics
but we don't have that information anywhere do we
but but you you are segmenting
well i'm i'm doing one on segment similarity in the end yeah i'm doing like finding similar segments basic latent semantic analysis but
but like f for now like your segmentation is just splitting a meeting up into different blocks ver
not not from what colin is doing from what i no it's only like i'm writing an algorithm that which then tries to also again based on word p occurrence patterns try to link together maybe different ones of those
so
so that yeah
yeah i'm also a bit b like i'm not a hundred percent sure about rainbow being the right thing 'cause it seems that rainbow does in its structure quite rely on having different examples of the same category sort of in in a way
'kay
you know what as a byproduct of my l s a  i'll provide um a vocabulary
like sort of a dictionary which for each word gives an entropy score entropy score which just tells you of
how much information the presence of a word tells you about which topic it is
not which category like i'm not i'm not lumping together separate topic segments into categories but just like how
much this word tells you about wh how likely that w the occurrence of that word makes it that it's a specific segment
topic segment which is some measure already of how widespread this word is versus how specific
f to a certain segment that is and i'll just provide that because that's just not much more
work than just the usual thing and then we can see how we can tie that in with the other stuff
so if you um keep on working on rainbow meanwhile and try to find a way how to tie your rainbow stuff into
some way that we can attach it to a certain time segment
i'm just thinking wh if
it it used is each word completely unique like sort of does it treat each word each occurrence
of word as a completely unique event or does it i mean no it it has to i mean basically the the form of the word is
important right we can't just replace the word by an arbitrary string
because it looks if the same word occurs again and stuff
yeah it it has to work with a m yeah well i think it's a stupid question like it it it has to work on on on the word like on
what i was thinking is whether if we replace the word by something uniquely id identifiable then it wouldn't make a different which order it is but that wouldn't
work because it needs the word because that's all it's working on it's the word and that looks if that word occurs again and versus how often that
word occurs in other context right so we can't attach some type of information to the word just to the word string itself like
making an underscore making the time or something that wouldn't work
but would it have that in the untruncated version then like would it s would the output be the untruncated version it will probably um no i don't think it would
yeah for now i mean really just like
yeah i think if we work together on an on an entropy based score it's let me see if i can demonstrate
t i mean let's just keep on talking meanwhile and i'll try to start that up
it's it's it's really d it it's a very simple thing but it it basically just
does something which tells you how specific a word is in a sense it's in a it's it's basically just
to to a high degree really telling you how r how rare a word is or how common a word is
but uh as as the first step that's probably for for a prototype for next week that's probably not a bad thing i mean even if it's just
that even if you just like if you have segments where where lots of rare words occur highlighted in darker red than segments
where all the very common words occur that's just that's somewhere to start from
and it's it's a bit more sophisticated than that but then de facto it just ends up doing that mostly from what i figured out
um
actually i think i'm not gonna not gonna start that now because that's probably gonna take too long
so
if we get it on a word by word basis whatever you do it'll probably appear in a word by word basis and what you have on a sort of segment but not quite segment base
'kay what about the following model i mean this is a very unscientific way of doing it in some sense but what if we if we take time
as the standard unit for now and sort of like make a massive one segment split super array
because everything you're doing can in one way or the other be ti tied down to actual time so if we if we
if for if for each one segment time slot we could attach a value and then it would be easy to then go back when if we have the time
marks here and re map that onto onto the length of a segment you know what i mean so if you have for
each word say and we know that word starts at this segment and ends at that segment and you have for
like for some time period w the overlap and that period on the f  ones and that period or something so you also have a value
which can be tied down to a time and then we could just in m in matlab or in something just create some massive
super array of
of things for each for each like sort of time sampling slot and and calculate a value for this and once we have this array
we can go with the script and sort of go for each segment to the starting and end times and say okay this is from our time segment
f here to this time segment there so we take the some of those and divide them by by the number or something create the average and put it
in as the value for the segment you know what i mean
oh
tha that's that's a fiddling play in the end but that problem we'll always have because we don't have a useful way of automatically evaluating um
we don't have a way of usefully evaluating automatically what's good and what's bad so it's it's probably always
gonna be a question of looking at it and saying okay like running it with different different
factor loadings and seeing okay this way it works this well and this way it works that well
but it probably be more difficult for mapped t to map for you to map it on so for you sort of i
yeah but so you say that inst like you basically say w having an array where each each cell is is one like is o is one word and then you would map your information onto individual words
hmm
would you be able to find out which word that is and
'kay and and then we could have like some type of just point in the end where the one scores from the all the individual
word cells get multiplied all with like for each utterance or whatever you have get all multiplied
with the same value all the ones that are within that utterance that's sort of the combination of of the two scores
and then we'd have to go back again and then put that back into that segment mode here
so that we because in the end we don't want it on a per word basis but probably on a per segment base
oh yeah yeah actually that yeah that's true so that it's easier if you
are able to yeah well i think that's probably back where we started at this but you said it wi but you said it's more complicated because your segments aren't those segments exactly
hmm and their segments do overlap
uh the tho those do or those don't
mm hmm
okay so you could on their granularity you could on their granularity create a score like for each for each of their segments
well i guess i mean for you if you know for each word if you find that out then it has to be possible because if we know sort
of this is going from word to word or it this is going from time to time and then there has to be a way then for you say okay this
concerns these following words and then just make make a simple mean over them
i think an interesting thing is if we don't combine your two scores in the
in the x m l  file you had but if we do that in the software then we can probably make ways of playing with it in the software and sort of l you know like
adapting some sort of control like playing around with look like it's playing with different
weightings for that the utterance based one versus the word based one and sort of look at it dynamically
you know what i mean
like playing around sort of figuring out what's the best way of combining them by playing around and looking at the results
yeah
yeah we could probably like make a uh um graphic display initially at least for our experimenting we'd just place them in different ways and then see how they interact with each other
okay yeah so do you think y like both of you then can map
something onto their segments like just each of you provide one value like double value or whatever
like one decimal value or whatever onto onto exactly their segments
it's stated both in
it's done both in terms of words and in terms of segments it's a bit sad sort of that we do this before we've truly figured out how
the nite x m l  thing works because now we're doing it all by hand and like parsing and un parsing that thing and it's it's all
part of the framework uh
how much easier would it be if we truly understood this so
'kay i might just change my order of in which i do things and like forget my latent semantic analysis stuff until the weekend and try to really make sense of the
of the nite data system now so that maybe as soon as i've understood that we find ways of doing that in within the nite framework already so that we don't manually have to parse times and entire things together
well at the moment what you would do like to to solve this problem is you would sort of like write some perl script or something that gets this time value out of here and
okay

mm hmm mm hmm so provided that you get your words in the right order do you think it is an easy task for you to it it's a f relatively feasible task for you to to get just a single value per segment
okay and you say you think you're able as well to map onto those segments
and if you're both able to map into those segments then we should be able to get one file where we have like whatever two values value a  and value b  both as attributes for
for this
and that we could load into a prototype and see what types of disp what ways of displaying this information are there
hmm
mm hmm
hmm
there's probably also social interaction factors in that there's sometimes just a meeting like if people adapt their f  zero to each other then they're sometimes p
yeah
can you not do something like just like not measuring the f  zero or the amplitude at all but just like the variance of f  zero within
a certain time frame and like sort of like just have some part for its very low variance with more the same f  zero and one
where there's a lot of more variance i don't well actually i don't know about that at all
yeah sorry
mm
hmm
okay
so at the moment you you just you measuring the f  zeros relative to the average for the speaker or
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm ri so the average
okay
um so what you would be feeding in would be just like one value per speaker per meeting so that
oka that that's that's your average baseline okay okay no yeah that that makes m yeah that makes a lot more sense yeah so
that would show you how much relative to how he sort of how he's performing generally in that meeting relative to that how
he's in a specific segment he or she
yeah yeah and for you that would be quite easy to translate into those segments
yeah guess i've asked this question fifteen times now sorry uh
hmm
oh they w they do exist
the castrati corps of the international computer science institute oh well i'm afraid i have to go soon but not quite sure i mean is there anything more we have to talk about anyway
yeah see as soon as as soon as i'm halfway through my l s a  like basically as soon as i have
the the matrix built if of the document by word stuff it's very easy to then calculate for each word
a score and i can just give you those scores and you can do with them whatever you want
yeah i think colin dave and me will actually work on on the java stuff and it and we'll just see whatever you whatever you supply us we'll try to tie in and visualise in some way or another
um i'll ask jonathan if we can postpone the meeting to one o'clock so that would give us a chance of meeting in for an hour before that to discuss the questions that we had
yeah i haven't gotten like sort of my confirmation that w wednesday is fine i'm not sure if i'm supposed to expect
a confirmation for my confirmation from him now or but i'll just email him again and s ask him if we can maybe make it one sorry
we said twelve and i'm asking if he can make one this is a bit frustrating
at the moment this project isn't it it's so like difficult to to get to the point where you understand
enough to really feel that i don't know i'm not feeling that i'm really working at the moment i'm more just trying to make sense of everything
and it's a bit too far into the meeting for that and into the project for that
hmm
i guess as soon as we have a framework in the w in the type of the prototype where like sort of each of us can tie in their stuff and
see what it l how how it looks like and how it performs you know that probably makes it a lot easier then but it's sort of it's a boot strapping problem like
for the prototype we need some type of data but to develop the data it would be a lot easier to to have the prototype
anyway i gotta go
hmm
yes but if it's if it's in a form which is easy to read in at the moment that would be fine sort of like if basically if we have something like this segments
file but for each of you like just have one attribute i think it's really easy if we don't merge them before hand
but if we let them if we combine them in the prototype or don't at the moment because then we can easily d
display them individually c contrast them to each other and play around with how y to combine them
exactly yeah yeah and i mean computationally multiplying two integers or doubles or whatever shouldn't be the thing that slows us down
yeah
alright
yeah





you you have this going behind your ears the yeah yeah
hmm
no just maybe talk about um how you would give me your data file yeah
that's um the interface between having the topic segments and calculating the uh information importance of words
yeah so i i would need separate files for each segment or just maybe have delimiters inbetween each segment
okay yeah and y then i can make files of that
alright
no i don't kno know it no
yeah that's fine
i just i just need a a title for the file but doesn't matter what it is
mm

so uh we have then when we are mixing our um values together is it um a value for each um expression for each sentence or something
yeah
mm mm
yeah
yeah i would just end up with uh values for each word so i wouldn't have um
any boundaries for segments at all
i just i just would have the words and then how we um how long each expression would be i don't know
yeah but what is an utterance uh yeah
okay
so what we what we would fit in into the xml files would it be uh um a value for each utterance or what you
okay
mm hmm
so then we would have to fit in more than just one where values um
yeah
but um
mm uh huh
yeah it's better
so we n would need a value label for each of those segments that are not dialogue acts
for all those that point to the actual words

yeah that's there no above
yeah
yeah
so you mean an a an attribute yeah
wouldn't it be easiest to just incorporate a new attribute in in this file
yeah i don't know that's probably not very uh nice but would quite easy wouldn't it
yeah
but they display the segments in or that the utterances i in their um
user interface as well where the words are y um displayed
so so they have they have their utterances displayed in their interface so that's they um access probably this file and then they display the words so why shouldn't we be able to do that uh
yeah the problem is probably that um i extract all the words and then uh i don't um use an i d  or something for it so it would be difficult to write it back to the right position
it depends on the position i think yeah
yeah i i could use another a different approach though it
mm yeah
mm hmm
um would you think it would make sense to just take um file files
by speaker it's it doesn't matter what input i give to um
to rainbow so i just could g use the files as they are i don't know if that's that would
give an output
i don't know
no it um i think it's not uh versus the whole corpus it's um
you have certain categories and you measure which words um
have the highest information for one category so it's the categories across each other
i think
um probably yeah but yeah it's it's s strange
yeah
yeah but what what the problem is i don't know exactly i think the information gain in rainbow is
ordered by the value of the information gain not i am not sure if i can get the
right order and the values
that's the problem
but i um if the order stays the same it's no problem at all to i just write back again but if uh it's ordered by information gain i don't know where the words come from because it's it has a bag of words representation
uh yes is it is it was made for text classification
yeah that's the problem
yeah um what it actually does is that you you put in some documents and you have several documents per category
um and you have several categories and then it measures um which words are
typical for a certain t category and if you get a new document it will um
compare which words are in that new document and if there are a
lot of words that um are typical for one category it will assign it to that
category and if it's typical for another one it will assign it to that one
yeah it's because you have um y um you have um oth different files
if if this is your directory you have um um a diagra um
a directory one two and three and this represents the category everything that's in there is in
category one a
yeah just split it up somehow yeah
yeah
no i've just um split them up uh somehow um by um there are several documents for
um each meeting and i just put one in each category so uh it's it's not very sensible at the moment because i'm waiting for the um topic segments or i'm just yeah
yeah yeah probably yeah maybe it's it's better if i write it myself because otherwise it's too easy to just split things up into bins and it it wouldn't be any work at all in terms of programming or something
alright
mm hmm
mm hmm
how does it calculate that actually
okay
yeah but that's the sa uh almost i think similar to what i'm doing because words that are in every class that are not very informative but words that are only in one class are are very informative for that class
oh okay
alright
yeah that's th yeah
for a specific word per
per
all over the place and in my case it would have i think it would have different uh values for each category but in that category it would have the same value at each place
do you know what i mean
yeah
um that would be best but i i would have to look if that
um at least it works if there are several categories with each with one document each but it um yeah
yeah that's the questio yeah i don't know
mm hmm
mm okay
oh no i li i th i thought something else that we d um we just split i need somewhere
to split and that um splitting at category boundaries um splitting at topic boundaries
would a nice thing to do rather than just splitting somewhere so yeah
yeah
yeah but it i think it should work for just one document because it it compares between the categories
and if you just have one document um it still can find out which words are
informative for that category and which are not so if you have just one document in each
category and there are a lot of um occurrences of the word the in each one
so this word will be not very informative across the categories so it should work for one
but i'm not sure if how exactly it it um calculates everything uh i think it's not possible
to look that up
yeah maybe it's possible to have a list that it's o that is ordered by
yeah don't know
mm hmm
um i don't know what you mean by that it's uh
mm hmm oh right
mm
alright yeah you you can use um
some kind of um truncation maybe if you attach a number to each word and say that it should omit the last part
uh probably not no no
yeah maybe i should try something different and just programme it for myself
because um
mm
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah but how can we get to know what makes sense as a a function for joining everything together might be difficult to find that out yeah

mm hmm
you you could always find out how many words there are in an utterance couldn't you
yeah so
for example
mm
so but
mm
mm hmm

mm
yeah then we sh yeah
we could even yeah we could even have a look at our different measures if they um
come up with the same same kinds of yeah
uh i think if i can provide something for the words as they are
it's stated from where to where the segments go it should be uh should be possible
yeah so it must should be possible yeah

mm hmm
you mean by matching strings or what
yeah but what i've done is um a parser an x m l  parser where you can get the start times
so yeah that's quite easy because it's it's an attribute and you just s say that you want the values of those attributes
i think that should be possible i don't know how long it takes me but
mm

is laughter annotated at all
because you could take that on ours out maybe if you take the laughter out and then calculate it
mm yeah

not the moment maybe if we meet at the weekend
oh i don't know
yep

so uh no how about the the prototype if we want to show him something on monday we definite have to work together some of us at least have to work together to get it running probably
alright


yeah me too
 
 
 
 
 
yeah and also we don't have to recalculate if just one
okay








look's good
yeah
okay
yeah that's true i think
oh yeah
yeah
yeah we haven't got that much to talk about i don't think
yeah
yes we can do that
alright
yeah well that that's the way it works it's got delimiters in between the mar the boundaries but
yeah if you're happy to do that yeah and you're saying you need a a label for each segment but i mean the most i ca you don't need a one well i could give you an i d  but it'd be quite difficult to actually give a topic a title
right okay yeah that's no problem

hmm
mm
um is it not segments or is it dialogue act dialogue acts
yeah
i think that's it yeah
yeah they've all got an i d  for each utterance
yeah and it's got a different uh file for each speaker
n no it just points to the to the words
yeah yeah
the i suppose so the utterances but also includes things like like
yeah think so
mm
yeah can you not just leaves those lines blank
oh alright okay
hmm
yeah what did you use to make that file just in perl you didn't use an x m l  parser
okay
hmm
hmm
hmm
well like function words and stuff
mm
hmm
well um when it splits the topics up it does do it on regular words that um that occur but it doesn't tell you what they are no
hmm
yeah
yeah
yeah you can't really get any other output
no no
mm hmm
yeah it's supposed to split it into cu coherent topics with the similar information
hmm

hmm yeah

hmm
hmm
hmm
hmm
hmm
yeah
oh i'm sure it'd be quite straightforward some of the tasks we have to do but yet no one really understands them the actual x m l  parsing
hmm


yeah that sounds like an idea
yeah yeah just send us an email and tell us what's happening
right
no

we should make a big sponge lemon and then it'd be it would be yellow it's yeah
mm


no it's got it's got it


wow

uh it looks threatening
it looks like yeah

wow

then d blind don't watch t v  they do

the l c d  and the other stuff uh i think
ben bana



hmm
but uh price price not withstanding um is it too complicated is it gonna be too much just overload
but but the thing is when you use a remote control you never look at it right you're looking at the t v  and and it's uh it just seems kind of like a a needless th
so which vegetable okay
the the lemon well what are the options
oh
okay
um so
i guess there are a lot of options that we're gonna have to choose from among
and i'll i'll give you the uh i guess technical considerations for those
and i'm gonna use the whiteboard just 'cause we haven't used it
right so the way i'm gonna do this is uh we're gonna take a look at some old remote
controls see how they work uh reuse the the vital kind of um essential
pieces of it and then we'll throw in our new innovations um and keep it all within budget
so uh yeah looking inside a a very simple remote control um this is what they sent me
'kay here's uh the competition i suppose
um you open it up there's a circuit board inside um and there's a a chip a processor the t a  one one eight three five which um receives input from the buttons and ch
right it's very they're very cheap remote this remote costs nothing you know um so that takes a signals
from the buttons and translates it into a sequence of pulses that it then sends to
the to the amplifier which is made of some transistors and amplifiers op amps
and then that gets sent to the uh to the l e d  light which i can kinda see
is that little red light bulb at the end and that sends out the infrared uh light signal
to the television oh here it is
um so this is kind of the the bear essentials that we need to have in our remote control because it it defines the uh
r um no i mean this is a very old one so now with the new technology this is a a minimally small and cheap thing to make
right so this is what we need to have for certain
um so you know as we said we got the outer casing which we have to decide you know what's it gonna be
um the board we have to use basically uh the same set up processor
um we'll probably use the more advanced processor than they had amplifier and transmitter are all standard
um so for the casing uh this an e mail i got from our manufacturing team
uh you know we have a bunch of options from wood titanium rubber plastic whatnot
um latex double curved curved
so lots of choices what do we think
uh or sponge i guess isn't on there right organic sponge
uh yeah it's very elasticy for sure
um
yeah so
okay so here are a a plastic
uh latex
oh right
so something with give to it okay and
and the colour is yellow right
yellow okay um
mm' kay
so yellow for the body and then what colour for the buttons
so multi coloured buttons

okay
okay
mm 'kay so the shape we wanna go
um how exactly maybe
double
what about a banana
yeah
okay like we could have a big banana shaped remote control 'cause it's yellow fruit right

oh i it doesn't matter which end you point i guess we could have a little l e d s on each end

so a spongy banana re yeah
okay okay
see
so maybe an an unidentifiable fruit or fiable fruit or vegetable like so it would have a stem perhaps and a
maybe a it'd be s axially symmetric
so it'd look like this kinda
like a gourd almost or a squash of some sort
yeah and it has a a clear top and bottom so y so you could say you know it transmits from this end

yeah
okay so double curved single curved what do we feel
okay
okay um i guess since you're the marketing guy
we'll uh
okay we could do that um

okay so
so buttons
okay just like that
okay with the scroll wheel or no
okay uh i could put the microphone here
okay there's the microphone
where should i put the microphone
okay well we can do some user test with scroll wheels right
okay
okay so should the microphone be just anywhere on it or
'kay there's the mic

um n well we can
whoops
um
yeah um
oops sorry okay

right
hmm

they can work from a you don't have to hold it
yeah

i it could even encourage healthier habits for television watchers you know they have uh fruits all round them now just make sure they don't eat the remote
yeah

okay but yeah
but yeah about the speech thing it doesn't have to be hand held or close it can sit at a distance and pick it up still
yeah yeah
okay um so
yeah s i guess we decided on material right so that that spongy latex rubber everything feel and the colours we got down and the shape maybe we'll just make it kinda mix and match type of shape or
yeah
okay
mm
mm hmm
great um as for the energy source um you know almost every remote control uses just batteries but we don't have to be limited by that we can use a hand dynamo um i don't know what that means we crank it
right it's like those watches that you c so this might be an idea for something that people really wanna grab you can shake it if it's out of power
okay so if it if it's not working i guess people's natural reaction anyway is to just shake the thing
right
okay
uh there's solar power um
yeah
okay so probably just
mm
'kay
okay
so uh a rechargeable battery okay um the user interface the buttons i guess we talked about this already
um
hmm
uh th the uh the electronics um basically the more features we add um
oops this one so the more features we add the fancier chips we need to buy and put in which adds to the cost as you can expect um
but uh i think we can keep it all under budget
so uh yes so the speech thing you said our our techno our research and development department came up with some break through so just in time
right right
yeah and keeping the l c d  screen out
huh
oh yeah that was that was it

so control f  eight right
try uh flipping the screen down
'kay
oh i get to do it too
oh neat
yeah yeah
okay save everything to the shared documents is that right
oh
uh these lapel mics are trouble
are we done with our meeting
yeah
yeah
hi me raj again uh in this meeting i i'm going to discuss about the trend watching
uh how these trends is going to affect our market potential and how important is this so we have to
look on this
first of all methodology the met methodology to find out the trend was incl uh
was done in a way we have done a rec not only a recent remote control market survey but we
also considered the latest fre fashion trends of the market because we think that this is also a factor
which will affect our sales and profit
so what are our findings in our uh in our findings we have seen that
when we did our remote control market survey we found that uh people l
uh people do have preference for tho fancy mobi uh f remote controls which look and
feel very good rather than having a functional look and feel uh good so this sh
this clearly indicates their preference for the design their outlook of the remote controls so we should
take into uh we should consider this factor as the most important factor because this factor is
twice as important the second factor which is further ti twice the as important as the sec as uh the
third factor so this factor becomes the most important factor in our surv uh uh
in our mark uh means in take in designing our rem uh remote controls
no the first one is the uh the outlook of the mobile the it should have a fancy outlook
the fancy design uh rather than just having a functional look and feel good
it should have a fancy look and foo feel good the second most important aspect is that remote control should
be a technologically uh innovative we must have some technological advancement in the remote control
tha rather than just putting it as it is as the other remo uh remote controls are so it uh should be
technologically innovative like glow in the dark or speech recognition something like that so
that indicates our technological advancement
and the third most important aspect in the ta to take into consideration
is that it should be easy to use like it shouldn't be too much co complicated there shouldn't be too many
buttons on this mobi uh remote control it shouldn't be too complicated uh like this way
and it should be uh and customers should be provided with manuals that is easy to understand in their local
language something so that they could know how to use these remote controls
when we did uh f fashions uh recent fashion uh our recent fashion update shows that
ah yeah
y yeah uh yeah we have to because uh d you can see how people
have related their clothes shoes and everything with fruits and vegetables because the g world is now changing
it's trend towards organic becoming more and more organic becoming yeah
so yeah so something like that we we should do
and people uh the f feel of the material is expected to be spongy rather than just having
a plastic look hard look yeah yeah so so that they
could play with it while handi uh while handling it so that should also be taken into consideration
so these are my views so
no it ca y a the rubber which is good for health
and which is quite disposable that we can take into co yeah 'cause we it shouldn't be have any harm
to the environment also because our company is very well for taking all these concerns into consideration
so we don't want to have any harm to the society so
so that's all


s uh we didn't find out any such point uh yes there could be but we couldn't find out any so
yeah
oh no
yeah uh yeah uh yeah yeah
hmm
yeah
hmm
but in our market survey we have seen that people are willing to pay more but they want the quality they want
f fancy look they want some new design something new uh yeah yeah so
even if we increase our cost little bit within uh some limits and we give something
new technological advancement as well as new design with fancy outlook i think we will
meet the requirements and we will be able to have a good sales in the market
and the
uh i it will be easy because there will be on l c d  s screen there will be different frent icons they can just click ok okay whatever they wa
ah yeah mm hmm
yeah i appreciate this idea because then this this will help us in our advertisement
also and we can relate with fruits and vegetables the people's choices that what our data shows that
so this w this w


uh the fashion trend shows that fruits and vegetables like people uh now
spongy
yeah then only we can relate it with something yeah exactly
or we can do something we can design two three shapes and we can have a public survey let the public choose what they want
yeah sure i will be happy to do that


yeah
or we can we can do one thing we can just have a remote control and
casings of different different shapes different fruit shapes in such a way that a any casing can be
could be fit into this mobile general piece so whatever people want like if somebody want it in banana
shape we will put that casing onto that mobile phone okay it will look l uh
yeah in that w
s s sorry
uh like if this is a like if this is a mobile phone uh we will design casing in
such a way like half of we need not to have a full cover we will just have a half of cover okay if somebody
wants it i in banana shape we will fit banana shape casing onto that so it will give a banana shape look
if somebody wanted in apple shape we will design that we will put we will put apple shape casing
on that it will give apple shape look so in that way you can have any that means whatever you want
without uh yeah
yeah button will be on the upper side buttons will be the on the upper side yeah buttons will be on the upper side
lower side we will just put the casing so half of that will be look the yeah not not the upper side
so from lower you can it means while you are holding of from this side you c you can have banana look or
apple look whatever so in that way we need not to d have different different shape mobiles everything
we will just design casings fruit shape and


yeah

but
but but do you think that it will be a good idea to use dynamo tha these type of cells because then people have to well like if the cell is out of bat yeah to mo yeah
yeah because most of the people yeah
uh solar power will w also not be a good idea because then they have to keep m their mobiles outside
in solar energy and the days when there is no sola sunlight yeah yeah what
we w yeah i think we should a rechargeable battery will be a good idea
they can they can recharge it
yeah
yeah
yeah that's yeah exactly
yeah
uh excuse me bri
you just touch the pad yeah
no
that's great
mm hmm
yeah
uh it was under a different name i will show you in shared documents
uh working components oh you didn't get that i will send new uh i'll put it in shared documents again
project documents sorry i put it in the shared documents
uh yeah
right that's great but i cou can't open that because it w asks uh for some username or password
i'll show you
ts
sorry
uh
yeah that's great
yeah th thank you
oh sorry
uh excuse me brian you have to keep your pen separate because i used your pen
s
hmm
hmm
so sh should
should we leave now brian or we are going to discuss something

yeah excuse me
sorry thank you yeah
so
um we are so the meeting will have about the same format as the last time so switching over i've just left uh my first two screens um i have
mailed you the minutes of the last meeting uh just to save time um and is there any questions you have that arised from last meeting that
are particularly bothering you
n
no okay cool then we shall start with a presentation from raj





alright okay
fashion
mm 'kay fruit and veg well there you go just what i think of when i think of a remote control
mm mm mm mm
mm mm mm mm mm
function f  eight
hmm

excuse me
uh yeah
mm 'kay
either
uh okay
right okay yeah

excellent
uh no just escape
should uh

'kay
looks pretty complicated
right okay
mm hmm like the middle button
okay
ah it's kinda like scrolling uh right well if i s if i'm thinking of the right one i've got the same thing in front of my monitor you scroll it and the when you reach the sort of um menu item that you require you press the middle of the scroll right okay
yeah presumably
yeah looks like uh looks like something out of a jet
okay
yeah i m i mean the one thing i think about about these ones is um these kl uh secured
areas um i've seen a lot of them with the the cover missing
so like have it hinge rather than sort of clip on or whatever
yeah i mean is that not sort of to assist the blind or something is it
strange
no they do they do they listen to it yeah
right okay
'kay but people tend to recognise certain shapes to do certain things anyway don't they
brilliant
that's handy
okay
okay
it's still it's still got to get within our twelve fifty you know
okay
yeah
i can't see tha although th i mean to be to be sure they have got i mean they are going crazy with the l c d  technology now so that you've got your l c d  t v s and everything so maybe the small
but i mean like i i the black and white i guess it just doesn't look funky enough um but i mean like even mobile phones or whatever have now have colour l c d  screens w i ju i mean i wouldn't know about the costs of them
twelve fifty
possibly
yeah
yeah
right
yeah well i mean we could make a yeah well si since we're going for the uh the k the sort of company colours i think your lemon wasn't that far s and if it doesn't work you know we've just made a lemon
mm hmm i like i like the colourful buttons as well
yeah
i mean we are marketing to sort of twenty five to thirty five so most people
will have come in contact with that kind of use
yeah
and that means tha that means you get to bump that bit to the t v  maker so
'kay


yeah looks like it
uh
yeah i was just thinking the self same thing

magic man

mm hmm
so this is a standard off the shelf kind of a chip is it
right
okay so can we make them to pretty much any size we like or is there a minimum or
they gotta be
almost a key ring
okay
'kay
well
well i mean like la latex has a kinda spongy feeling to it doesn't it um
yeah and that would k also give it kinda durability and
and ther that's also f sorta relatively cheap to cast um so maybe s uh a sort of uh plastic initial plastic with a a latex kinda sheath
oh right okay
i don't know what that stuff is
yeah
or at least incorporating yeah
i mean i forgot i we're sort of uh
i don't know what other standard silver kind of
other parts or uh
mm hmm
um
um i quite like the multi coloured buttons myself
yeah or yeah a limit uh maybe even just a limited multi colour so it it doesn't look too childish perhaps
yeah although i mean this uh uh also comes to shape as well i mean if we are gonna make it a novel i mean double curved sounds good to me if we're talking about sorta ergonomic and easy use
a bit comfier you know
yeah it's uh yeah that that'd be that's sort of comfortable to hold easy to hold so you don't drop it

well yeah i mean like
yeah yeah mm and a lemon might be a little hard to grip yeah
they only cost pennies

huh
um
i mean that that th
does it does seem a bit uh again childish maybe
s
and sponginess
huh
uh


yeah why the hell not let's that'll make us fifty million euros
um well i guess it's kind of dra uh you don't necessarily have to have it sort of clearly identified as a fruit just to have that kind of fruitish shape yeah
yeah we can relate it by advertising or
yeah
there's a good man there's a good idea

um i l i su i mean for the specific functions you know up and down uh play stop they've got i mean they've got standard sort of intuitive um
things that are always used
that's cool i like it um
uh speech recognition i think so we need a microphone presumably

yeah
i mean ho h h wel are we sure that scroll wheel does give ease of use

glad we're not doing this for real
yeah
and uh i think if this this new software for the sound recognition is the microphone
i would put it sort of sub centrally so it's yeah
so it can be sort of held and w we really need really gonna need to hold it if it's gonna be voice recognition
oops um

upsidaisy

i s i still like it um but that's me
yes or maybe it's just going a bit uh too far i mean we are pushing it probably with funny fruit shapes um don't wanna sort of overkill
'cause i mean like uh if we i mean how good is the speech recognition thing do we want to go for buttons at all do we want to just have a device that maybe sits and pretends it's a fruit
yeah you know and then you just tal i mean like everybody's got fruit bowl in front of the telly um
yeah make them make them think of fruit yeah
i mean uh some uh i l like think of a fruit that could sit sort of independently on its own like uh i dunno an apple
then it's just apple so sort of uh yellow apples though hmm
yeah okay yeah that's good
groovy

yeah
yeah so i mean like you could actually
yeah gives you the options
so a selection of casings
it kind of fi it fits with f fits with marketing um

like like mobiles yeah

you can standardise those i mean
i think tho i think if you're gonna have a facia then you'd want to have it so that it does go over the buttons 'cause when if you think about it if they're wanting it 'cause they want to look at it if they're using it and what they want to look at is facing away from them it doesn't really
you know 'cause that'd be in the palm of their hand and they wouldn't be able to see it unless you have sort of you got the buttons options on one side and you get the facia on the other side with a microphone so that you can place it face down
and you've got the facia and you can just talk at the
maybe
so you've narrowed it down to half a dozen options
yeah
yeah
okay so we stick with what we've got there
mm 'kay
mm hmm
well it's kind of gotta be our company's yellow so again i mean like we could have uh i mean we could quite easily have the the main body be a different
colour but have
kinda going round yeah
um i mean e even if i mean not necessarily that the um the whole body has to be of the company
colour so you know um blue and yellow tend to go to we well together so you have the main body blue with the yellow
logo and slogan running up one side of it kind of thing
w sort of
uh it's i think it's basically the more you move i it it's got a wee thing inside that just kinda powers it uh yeah
yeah i like that yeah
yeah
okay
you shake it and scream at it yeah
it does leave them with an obligation to especially if they want to use it uh uh sp uh specifically as um voice activated then if it's just sitting on the
okay okay right um what are the other options
yeah
i'm i'm with uh raj on that i think you know i've got i've got no i've got a north facing house there's not really ever sun coming in my window
oh that's true
i mean i w i w uh that idea that i thought um just on the basis of like ridding them of batteries and that kind of bother is having a
yeah having a rechargeable stand so that not only it doubles as a stand but um for using it as uh recharging it but also for using it as sound recognition
yeah that kind of thing
yeah
rechargeable
what's chip on print what's
sorry never mind
yeah and if we if we're just having buttons and the speech then we're getting our cheapest option of
chipping
that's good uh woah okay we're we're kind of uh we're kind of um excuse m i've just deleted that whole thing um we're kind of running out of time so if you could
uh
was that you um that was your bit's covered i just dele i just accidentally deleted what i was supposed to say next
um yeah oh yeah
and i just touch the pad
it's actually shut down
okay um now what we have uh our next meeting's in half an hour
and what i would like you guys to do is work on giving me
a model in clay
yeah it's you guys yeah so um you know i mean luckily we chose a nice simple shape um and further instructions will be sent by your personal coaches
uh yeah i hope i can recover this 'cause i've accidentally deleted it which doesn't really help me much
yeah can you save that uh send that last one again please raj as i still can't find it on the

okay
no okay thank you
um yeah project project documents
uh right that's that's the that it goes there automatically if you put it in project documents project documents is on the um desktop
really
oh right i think um hold on yeah i don't know if y it it just ca it just came up on my um
on my agenda s um presumably there's clay somewhere um

four
whoops light light please light right there you go
yeah quite and we're using this our basic chip set so it's all good
um i think we're almost done yeah
oh oops sorry man
uh okay still didn't manage to get down all the last bits so we had rechargeable and
uh
apples mm mm mm mm mm
'kay so we came up with that that's okay what's supplements supplements uh uh
see
i shoulda something like that if i kn see i i knew that i shoulda sort of engineered it so we k ended up making a diffi difficult shape just for cruelty
i wonder if they mean like literally make it sort of buttons and everything
um
uh no i think that's us our discussion over unless anybody's got questions or confusions 'cause i'm confused
huh
um uh we'll probably get questionnaire in a minute it's a

there we go warning finish meeting now
i rounded it up far too fast um where are we going my documents that's not what i want my project documents
there we go
mm hmm
okay cool
mm um no i don't think so
the last one is the most important one is it oh sorry
okay
okay
mm hmm
mm hmm
sorry i was just reading fruit and vegetables hard to know how we are going to incorporate that

okay yeah
yeah th that's very good
glow in the dark
okay
well that's good that's what we kind of predicted anyway
okay
okay
okay
okay the spongy not real spongy you can do you think like rubber would be good or does it really want to be like gel kind of stuff
okay quite disposable okay
oh okay
uh huh
okay

cool

mm a remote control yeah
and were there any factors that weren't important in the survey that they said we don't want
or was it just okay
cool
f  what is it um
yeah
okay
no signal
is that
okay and then f  five right
okay um
okay so the interface concept um
yeah the interface specification what people um how they interact with it basically
i think um so the method we looked at existing designs what are the what's
good about them what's bad about them um i looked at their flaws so we're going to look at their flaws everything um
and what the survey told us and what we think would be good
so a bit of imagination uh the findings i've got some pictures to show you as well
yeah
okay so most remote controls use graphical interface where you um have got s buttons and
you point it rather than having the output as a a stream of text or something um
and we also found that there's inconsistent layout which makes it confusing so i think for our remote control
there is some inconsistency already in ec existing in between remote controls but i think standard kind of um
shape and uh play and those kind of but buttons like the the top right
for on and off or something i think people find that important 'cause then it's easy to use
and we've got some pictures of some uh new remote controls to show you do i press escape f  five or just
escape okay
um oh i still haven't got my glasses on yeah okay so these are the some
of the pictures of existing ones i'll just walk you through them this
one is a voice recognition and that's the kind of idea we're going
for there's um an l c d  thing which we thought could i thought could get a bit
confusing and a bit expensive as well for us this one is got a kind of
scroll like a mouse which yeah um
and but i'm not exactly sure how you'd use that like would the computer come
uh huh that's like the l c d  one is it but the one below that has got like a little scroll function on the side but i presume that the functions must come up on the t v  screen
i think that's what that is so these are just a few ideas again that's just quite boring shape grey looks quite space agey but too many buttons i think on that one
yeah it does look kind of dangerous
um this one i thought was really cool it's w it's got the programmability function that we talked about you can put it
in there it's for your kids and it's quite an organic shape and the little circle around there is pretty cool
and that's really easy to use bright so i like this one lot for our design i think something like
that would be good of course yellow
right yeah
yeah that's true yeah um so maybe that could be built into one of the things and
it comes up on the t v  or something and this one the over sized one i don't know about you but
i think it's a bit too gimmicky i don't think that will sell very well
i guess so i don't know i think that's a bit
yeah exactly yeah and um this one
is just pointing out i like some of these things um the the raised symbols and everything but
pointing out um that this one the volume it is kind of pressing down but it would actually go
up because of the shape so that could that's a bit confusing um but the buttons on this i think
are it's just showing you how you can have different different um buttons they don't have to be all the same
so that's quite cool um
yeah exactly um f  five yes
so there are some of the findings so we need to combine those ones um and i've just got an
e mail from our technical department saying that they have broken
through with some new speech recognition software that you can program in um yeah it is just in time
very handy um so i think maybe incorporating that in our design would be
good it's you program it like you say record um and then play and then
record play machine and stuff like that so that's and it's much yeah
so that's quite cool uh personal preferences just some imagination the raised symbols i thought were good
the l c d  it does look smart but i think maybe for our budget do you think that would be a bit too
expensive to have the
yeah
and the speech recognition 'cause i think we're definitely going for the speech recognition are we
uh huh
uh huh but our budget we've yeah
uh huh
okay
i'm not sure if the if for twenty five euros uh per uh twelve euros fifty m manufacturing cost
the l c d 
yeah
no
yeah s
uh huh
yeah that's the thing because
yeah
that's true yeah
and one of the survey findings was that they want it easy to use so i think i'm not sure about the l c d  it's a
it's great it's a good idea but for our budget and for the thing we're trying to go for eas easy to use it's
not the thing we should go for i think child friendly i thought this was good as you pointed out the
um
the bit it often goes missing especially with children but it's a good shape and the organic is kind of we could make a vegetabley kind of round shape i think
yeah i know carrot
yeah
but we don't want it to be yeah um the child friendly yeah easy to use it seems quite easy to use i like the d the different shapes of the buttons and stuff i think that's a good idea to go for
yeah and the mouse one i thought it was a good idea because people use mo mice mouses now with the scrolling thing um
yeah
s yeah so they'd be able to use that um as i said i think i i'd presume it would come up on the screen um so there you go
yeah
so that's um the user interface
design
so okay i'll take this out now then
there you go
mm


mm hmm

mm i'm not sure about the sponge
yeah
yeah
i like the rubber the stress balls i think you know that could be a bit of a gimmick like it's good to hold and
yeah
and that might be quite durable and easy to chuck around
yeah y yellow incorporated yeah
i think
mm
yeah the buttons w like 'cause there's gonna be the the cover the the rubber or the plastic casing and then the buttons in probably two different colours or i if we're having buttons actually i don
yeah
you do have ones like um play could be green or on and off is red and stuff like that yeah
makes it easy to use
yeah that's true because that blue one did look quite hardish
mm hmm
mm hmm yeah
yeah
like uh an hour glass kind of figure is that what you're thinking of or just like a
it's not yeah
we could make novelty remote controls

yeah but then how would you point it
how would you point it what

yeah
y i'm i'm not sure about the banana idea
rubber banana okay
yeah i think maybe just draw on the kind of fruit and vegetable shape and what else did you say about fashions what was trendy
and spongy yeah
yeah
yeah
maybe yeah
like what's what's that i don't even know the name of it some kind of you know where it's like looks like a little snowman kind of thing i don't know the name of that
yeah that's what i was thinking
yeah maybe that's what they are
'cause that you can hold it in like the bottom bit and
yeah
i don't know what do you guy what do you think
no
yeah
uh huh
okay
okay
and buttons would did we say uh different shapes of buttons
mm
yeah
yeah what about the scroll wheel and speech recognition
mm hmm
yeah i'm not sure um i mean those ideas i saw were just for inspiration i think um yeah i can no i'm not sure
i couldn
yeah
yeah
yeah
that's cool


so let's not use the whiteboard any more
and uh so what else was there um the what about the glow in the dark thing the strip around it are we just gonna leave that
you still like it
'cause we've got the uh technological innovation with the speech recognition system
'cause um it could yeah
especially with yellow mm i dunno
then you put it in the fruit bowl
mm hmm

yeah
yeah do we need buttons
mm
i quite like the shape i quite like the design of that uh 'cause that could sit on its own and it's quite got a quite steady base
um
and as we say we n we don't wanna be too ridiculous with the fruit things you know

okay
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah 'cause you said about disposable didn't you
you said about disposable earli people want disposable things so we could do that like have a choice
yeah
yeah
okay
okay we still need the buttons in the same places thought don't we

oh that's the other side oh okay
oh half a fruit oh okay okay
okay okay
okay
mm mm
yeah
mm hmm
yeah
yeah
well um because well i i'm not sure if we should go so far in the whole fruit thing because i think we should maybe
just take the inspiration from the fruit and uh because what yeah w i
think wh wha would we're trying to get to twenty five thirty five year olds who want it quite trendy as well they said they wanted something
that looks fancy and i think maybe fruit could be a bit of a too much of a gimmick but something
ergonomically shaped and organic like good to hold based on fruits and natural
things like that because al already we're going a bit gaudy with the yellow you know
i mean we could make it nice pale yellow
okay
okay
yeah maybe we could have that pale yellow and then an outside bit bright yellow with you said the logan the slogan
because
yeah
yeah yeah
uh huh
oh a d a dynamo
yeah
yeah like with those watches that you kind of twist yeah that's quite cool
yeah it is yeah
yeah then they have to pick it up and then activate it and then yeah
that's true

but w like just normal light

and we're a very environmentally friendly company aren't we as well
yeah
yeah
like like a hand like one of those portable phones kind of thing
mm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm just in time
yeah mine seems to have turned off i can't do anything
no
it's on but there's nothing on the screen

cool
yeah mm
okay
yeah
i think i've saved mine already
cool
fun

yeah star fruit
no oh yeah we can do buttons
no i'm good
okay
mm
mm yeah
nope we're all set
which which is the clunky one the one on left or on the right 
okay



no i'll add it later i guess the presentation

no no


um function f  eight
function the blue button next to the control on the left yeah you have to push it together
yep
nope try that again
wait
yep there we go

increase that 'cause we can't see the
that's much better
there you go
bouncing on top
is installing a new remote control something that people
um i think it'll be the mid range to the high end market in terms of people 'cause twenty five euros for a remote how much is that lo locally in pounds
is that too is that a lot of money to buy an extra remote or a replacement remote right um so
maybe not the high end range but maybe middle middle up ish kind of
you know how much i dunno i guess you pay what ten ten quid for a remote like a simple replacement
right i mean if you lost your remote and the first thing you just wanna go out and get would you how much would you pay
yeah
yep
i i think twenty five to thirty five is is is fair to add that in as a group as well because that's more than half your group of people who are willing to at least try and use your technology
yeah
i think perhaps that age group is significant as well because those are people who use the computer who are familiar
with their with computers in in their everyday work i think people who are maybe about i wouldn't
say thirty five but people who are about forty ish and above now would not be so dependent and reliant
on a computer or a mobile phone or something like that so these are people who are gadgety right people who are u growing up used to
you know in schools and in universities when you go on to their working lives people who would you know regular yeah yeah
mm

i i think one thing we should try not to avoid is not to say we have to use speech recognition right now because
um based on what you've go y everybody's saying right you want something simple you want basic stuff and
you want something that's easy to use speech recognition might not be the simplest thing for somebody to use
um but what i'm saying is that we're we're trying to lock ourselves into a s particular kind of technology rather than
focusing on on exactly what are the features that we're gonna say and then you know say speech
recognition is good for this speech recognition is not good for this so maybe we should i suggest that we think about speech recognition
anyway it's a it's something that can be used to fulfil a function but at end of the day we don't look at the technology but we look at the function
first
okay sure

sorry do you mind passing me my notepad thanks
cool um okay um well this is just the working design
um well this is just what how i would go about it um i guess i try
to define like what we're doing now try to define what we're trying to get done um i think in a practical way we kind of know
what it is we've used it we're familiar with it but we're we can't n we haven't narrowed down um exactly what the
things we're trying to fulfil like besides the basics i think back in the back of our minds we know what the basics
are has to change channels has to change volume but in like specifics right which one of the basics are you trying to
target um are there certain parts of the basics that are more important or less important than the basics um and i just
the idea is just to get everybody to um i usually have a have have a design
that's there as a basic so you know things that to start everything going but i guess
everybody does have some idea so i don't think um there's a need for that
um okay this finding things is a little bit confusing so i'll go into the diagram first
it just explains how the process goes through from a from the basic technology point of view the basic steps that you need
um in the diagram and in this slide probably works better um okay you need some power source
'kay a battery or something to keep it going um and that power source is important because it ties you down to
um how long the device will last um it ties you down perhaps a bit later on in terms of the technologies
um how far you can transmit the signal or the complexity of the functions that you want like for example
voice recognition right that might be constrained because that you might need to power a microphone you might need to power other things so
that's one perhaps constraint there um
th okay the basic thing is there's a user interface where people punch a button or talk into it or smile
to it or blink their eyes whatever you know and that um picks up an input from
a user um uh a logic a series of logic has to decide what the user is telling
the device and the device has to r you know based on you push button a  so i will do something with button a  so maybe
button a  is the power button okay um and then it needs to be able to send the signal out to the device itself which is
the receiver here um and i think that's about it in terms of my design um
it's fairly general um and i guess the purpose of this is also not to restrict you in in the way you're thinking
like um voice recognition right um if it's something which is important then
we just add more power rather than having a thing that we don't have enough power so it's not really a constraint in that sense but i mean these are
functionally you know the base what the technology has to do um so i guess the rest
of it i think we should maybe you you wanna go back to what the functions are i think that's more relevant to a discussion
yeah w i'm done more or less yeah ps oh it's just putting the rest of it into words but it's essentially the same thing um you have a transmitter an input device logic chip you know stuff like that um
i guess this would be
yep
um these these aren't technology options in that sense this is just um a basic principles
and basic components that are needed for example if you needed um if you needed to add
uh a voice recognition right then your user interface would be split broken down into more components right which
you have a microphone the v r  and stuff like that uh
yep yep so each component represents one function but i think the basic functions are the logic the transmitter
um and the receiver okay and the power are things that you won't have to care about um and those are
things that based on what your user interface requires then we'll add more functionality to it um there might be one
other consideration which would be that the the transmission between the remote control and the t v  for
example okay um are we gonna restrict ourselves to using the traditional technologies of infra red
thing because that's something you need to actually be physically be pointing to right
yep
there might be one other problem with the transmission um in particular right now since we're talking about voice recognition um
if somebody's gonna h talk to the device you ideally want them to hold it to them i it you may not require
that but you know um it's it's it's something very natural i guess you know to hold it to signal to the user
and push a button maybe to start s talking about it then you need to send the signal out so because if you're using infra red the line of sight
um say the t v 's at that chair and i'm standing in front of here and the transmitter is here it blocks it so
in that sense there's not really a restriction but it's something which you may have to think about later on in the process not so much
further down
there's there's not much specific specific information but i think that um one indication of infra red mean that you're just targeting traditional devices because infra red is something which everybody has

there's a there's okay from from a from a component point of view there's added complexity and you add cost
to it um and then there's probably the fact that you need another physical component you need a docking cradle for
example for you to put it in to charge or you need to get the user to plug it in um and most users
are very f use already used to the idea of buying batteries and putting it into the controller but unless
the controller's gonna consume a lot of batteries like he's gonna run through like twenty batteries a month then i don't think rechargeable
is something we should you know we really need to care about um

okay i think
another thing that you were saying about categorising the controls um maybe i could suggest we we
break them down into three simple categories one would be audio controls one would be video controls and
the other one would be a device um this may not map very well to advanced functionality especially but
i think that um from a manufacturer's point of view from a person designing the device but i think from
a point of view of a person using the device you know a t v  is something they see and something they hear um it's something
they do other things to like turn it on and turn it off i mean like so what we could have is like three buckets right where we could throw
things into like if we want this feature let's throw it into there and then from there decide whether it's basic or it's non basic
i mean it might help with the visualisation and it would actually help with the component build as well

mm no not really
mm
um things like on off because they don't have anything to do with what you see i me mean in terms of
picture and the entertainment value you know um so um
and channel because the on off also goes you know like on off like power not on off sound not on
off video although you don't turn off the video on your t v  but um you might wanna you know turn
off the sound say you wanna pick up the phone there's a mute button right so you you have you have a choice of putting it on to
um others or a device device is basically anything which we can't categorise right we put
it out
yeah anything to do with what you hear right you you put that into audio and then video is anything that you can see um
yep
yep
yep
like random which we have no other place to put but we need it somewhere there um even even if it doesn't map very clearly
what happens is that people at least have some in their mind it's easy to use i think that's one thing that
um and i guess from the component point of view it's easy to build as well 'cause things are like fixed

is that alright now
okay
sorry
okay everybody all set to start the meeting okay we've got half an hour for this one um to uh
discuss the um functional design all ready to go okay
um so hopefully you've all been working away and i've put the minutes of the last meeting in the project folder
um so i guess just to to recap on uh what we did last time
um kind of uh got to know each other a little bit and uh got familiar with all the equipment
and started to discuss um a bit about the project you know cost wise how much
how much money we had to s
um just want to tell you that you have three new requirements um which is the the first one
is that um uh the company's decided that teletext is outdated uh because of how
popular the internet is nobody uses teletext very much anymore so we don't really need to consider that in the functionality
of the of the remote control um they've also suggested that we um we only
use the remote control to control the television not the v c r  d v d  or anything else i think the worry is that
if the project becomes too complex then it'll affect um how long it takes us to get it into
into production the time to market so um we're just gonna keep it simple and it'll just control the t v 
and the other thing was that the company want the corporate colour and slogan to be implemented in the new design
um i'm not entirely sure what the corporate colour is it might be yellow because there seems to be a lot of yellow everywhere
well that's the thing i'm i'm not sure um
uh th because on the the company website uh what does it say
uh something
yeah i mean do they is that something they want actually written on it 'cause it's quite long
um or yeah just the idea but i'm not sure so that's something we can discuss as well so those are the three things just not to worry
about teletext uh only control the t v  and um and uh
incorporate the uh colour and slogan of the company um so
is everybody okay with any of that or do you want me to recap at all right
um time for presentations then who would like to go first
okay cool
oh yeah of course yeah g go on ahead
mm hmm
okay
alright
oop
um well we can chat away for uh for five minutes or so i think at at most just a couple of minutes anyway
mm hmm shall we sh well we'll stick to kind of your area for now
yeah
looks kind of yeah
well i think it's a valid point i mean like the one on the left looks quite um quite complicated and that
p r t  p p r o t  thing is incredibly confusing um so i see i see why
yo you know you might prefer the simpler design but yeah you don't want to lose out on you know what it does so maybe you
know you know you get a lot of remote controls where you kind of flip the thing open i think that's a good idea i think it's a good idea
mm hmm
uh huh
uh huh and then actual numbers for channels as well yeah
god i wou i would say that's required i mean there's no way anybody's gonna buy a remote control these days when if you can't actually individually select channels i mean would anybody disagree with that
um what else uh so don't need to worry about teletext don't need
to worry about v c r  uh any kind of like display controls
at all do you think we need to worry about you know like brightness and contrast
mm
yeah
i think are you are you maybe kind of thinking what we absolutely have to have and what would be nice
mm hmm
okay right well do you wanna maybe just at this point decide on what we absolutely must have as a p as a function of this um so so far just to recap you've got volume and channel control and
right okay um
mm hmm yeah
oka
mm hmm
okay uh well just to to wrap up quickly on this this little section have i just lost oh no um
uh do you think maybe that's the only kind of uh essential requirements and then maybe just things
that would be nice if it could do would be things like audio set up and display set up and things like that maybe like
a mute button that sort of thing any of you anything to add to that at all no
okay right um okay if we can move on to next presentation then please um
do you wanna
probably not actually

yeah
bit complicated it'd be nice if everything was wireless wouldn't it
right
oh like overlap between what you said oh well for all you know that that'll happen
mm hard to know what where your role ends yeah
okay
uh pr yeah press function and f  eight yeah
mm
yeah you wanna
oh oh here we go there you go
um
okay
right
can you um
right okay

yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
repetitive strain injury
mm hmm
okay so want something that looks good and is easy to use big priorities okay
mm
so it you wanna group all the different kind of types of functions together you know that's i think it's a good idea
mm hmm
okay
mm hmm
okay right
well um one of the things that we have to decide on by the end of the meeting is who we're gonna be um who's our
our target audience our target market um so if we want something that that
looks good and is easy to use but has y is fairly powerful product whatever who do we really want
to aim that at i mean
yeah who wou who would have the money to spend well i if if like twenty five euro is our
is our selling price then you can imagine well i don't i'm not really sure how much that will retail at but you want it's somebody who's
not gonna just use the remote that comes with their telly i suppose they're gonna actually go out and buy one so who do you think we're
aiming this at
it's about sixteen seventeen pounds i think
yeah okay
okay
okay
yeah
yeah yeah

okay
okay
yeah so do you think we're we're aiming at a fairly young market then
yeah okay
um do you think then uh voice recognition is something we should really seriously consider
what what do you think craig
n yeah
i think we are gonna have to narrow it down to say let's target these people and give them what they want and 'cause you know
there needs to be some kind of selling point to it so um anybody
anything there to add just kind of young professionals uh th like if we are going to include speech recognition it's
kind of between fifteen and thirty five seems to be like a really high response to that so we could say
that was our target
yeah
mm hmm okay so fifteen to thirty five look fairly young you know they have bit of expendable income to spend on this sort of thing
yeah
yeah
so
yeah
yeah so they'll not sh not shy away from something quite high tech that that's that's a good point um okay
so um so shall we make the decision uh to include speech
recognition if we can
okay why is that
okay
where you can activate it and deactivate it
yeah
okay
okay
uh huh
okay uh okay well do you wanna um give us your presentation and then then we can i don't know um
might have been a good idea to all deliver our presentations and then discuss but this is this is how we're yeah
exactly yeah oh it's something that's just occurred to me as well is if we make it um speech reco if we incorporate
speech recognition that's appealing to people um maybe with a physical disability as well
um
yeah
yeah
mm hmm
really
do you think maybe we need like further advances in that kind of area until it's worthwhile incorporating it though
mm course not there you go
right
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
uh huh
hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
okay
okay
uh well do you wan do you wanna finish up your your whole presentation then are you are you all done
mm
okay
okay right
okay
mm hmm
mm hmm
oh so this just show how we're kind of modularising the whole thing okay
mm hmm
yeah
mm hmm
okay
okay
okay
okay well well a worry that was was expressed in the new requirements was that if we made this too complex
it would e it would effect um how long how long it took us to get this to market so i th suspect it might
be a good idea just to restrict our kind of our creative influence on this on the user interface and not worry so much about
uh how we transmit it um because i mean it it's tried and tested intra red so we could stay with tha
mm hmm
oh yeah
yeah mm hmm
okay
mm
mm
yeah
okay
okay
w
yeah w well well we've um in the new requirement spec they said just to focus on the t v 
so that's what we should do for now i think something i was wondering about was the power um is it worth considering like
having like a charging unit as opposed to just regular batteries i mean is that something we really want to go into
do you think or should we just consider running on regular batteries
uh huh
uh huh
yeah
okay
okay so
yeah
yeah
okay so just stick to to regular
okay
um right so basically the um
i'm just gonna just recap uh what i said at the start was that um the
the whole point of this meeting was to f absolutely finalise who we're gonna aim this at and what exactly the product's
gonna do so um just to recap on are we all happy about the idea of um
aiming the product at um the fifteen to thirty five bracket um and
also the funct the the actual functions of what it's gonna do do you wanna recap on that craig

okay right
okay
yeah it's as optional functions
okay
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah

okay right um okay well i gotta kind of got five minutes to wrap up
now um next thing we're doing is having lunch whoohoo um and then we're gonna have thirty minutes of working
on the next stage um so i'll be putting the minutes of this uh this meeting
into the project documents folder um so uh i guess just to just to confirm
that we know what we're doing in the next well in the thirty minutes after lunch anyway um
for uh our industrial designer you're gonna be thinking about the components concept um user interface designer
gonna be thinking about our user interface and marketing you're gonna be thinking about trend watching um and you'll all get specific
instructions as well so um i dunno just just to to ask
now if you've got anything else you've thought about while we've been talking um do you wanna start with david
anything else to say at all no okay andrew
yeah yeah i think that's definitely a good idea
uh huh yeah
yeah
okay
yeah
okay
okay
okay so you're gonna have um audio which is gonna be like you know your bass settings and actual volume hi okay
okay and then visual
okay so brightness contrast things like that and then just actual device things like what channel you're watching turning on an off stuff like that okay um
mm hmm
yeah
okay
okay
okay um so yeah i guess just things to think about are you know like the fact it's gotta look good because of who we're
we're you know targeting this at um something maybe kind of quirky in design maybe make it kind of
ergonomic kind of to hold you know things like that um so i guess
i guess that's it that's the meeting over whoohoo

i'll go first
alright um can i st steal this from the back of your laptop uh
so this is the technical functions design
um
right to do the um the design i have i've had a look online i've had a look at the homepage which has given
us um some insp inspiration from previous products um i've had a look at the previous products to see what they offer
and um i would like to ask you guys for um your ideas about the design at the end of the meeting
um unfortunately we're not allowed to talk outside the meeting room so
um having a look at the existing products i found out that um it tends to come in sort of two extremes
there's either um a very complicated one that's got lots of buttons lots of colours very confusing you don't know what you're doing um
in that case the the labelling tends to be very bad um there's an example i'll show you at the end um sh show you
now
uh
here um the button there and there this one's prog sorry that one's perg and that one's prog and it doesn't really tell you what it does
um not sure if you had a a look at the other um control in that example um it's a very simple one it's got
only the basic functions mm but um it's the same size as the the hard to
use one uh it looked a bit clunky they're very big and not very much use for buttons
um and it's just very hard to access the advanced functions there's there's nothing for instance for a slow motion button
um my own preferences i prefer the the clunky one um it's very easy to use um but unfortunately
it does lack the advanced functions which i i quite like having on the controls um so i believe
the the advanced functions should maybe be hidden in a drawer or something like tha from the bottom of it
so now i'd like to ask for your preferences um not sure of how long we've got uh
um the clunky one is the one on the right
um i think it's supposed to be the same size but um it's got much fewer buttons it's you know it's very spread out and kind of you know i get the idea it'd be sort of about this size got very few buttons on it and
um do we have any functions that um we'd want on it i mean so far i've got um on and off um switch the channel up and down and put the volume up and down um they're just the the very basics you could use for a t v 
okay um you say that's a h a required one or a requested one would you like um the channels like the the numbers on thing um
um yeah
um
uh to start with um sort of a bit both um we need to find out exactly what we have to have um and after that we can add things if they're possible
there's um on and off um volume and channel and skip to certain channels with the numbers
do you want to switch places
just just switch them
think maybe the the wire in the back might be loose
um
well did you not say it was the the adults that were going for the the voice recognition sort of the the older group
uh f
yeah
i reckon one problem with speech recognition is um i've actually seen one of them used and uh the technology that was in that one wasn't particularly amazing so you end up yelling at the control for hours channel up

um
i think it'd probably quite expensive to put in
um i think we just say that it was gonna be the the most basic stuff possible um on off up and down channels up and down volume and uh skip to a channel
ta
um i think we include mute but apart from that um i think we just we'll go for the simpleness
yeah
um just about the three buckets um what would go in the the device functions one
um

could you plug me in
okay thanks
okay
'kay
okay
and the slogan like the actual written slogan or just to embody the idea of the slogan
'bout putting the fashion in electronics
sure

right
mm hmm
m yeah like a lot of a lot of what i've um read and prepared for this meeting fits in really closely
with what with what craig's just gone over so in part i could i could give you some of my personal preferences but i could also
th add some to this which is just about sort of um sort of market research but anyway
um we might come to that later
um clunky in what sense like um h heavier larger
i see so it's more just basic right okay
yeah
yeah sure
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
which was that
up the numbers or the up down

yeah
yeah

we don't no
yeah
well i think i think es essentially what we're doing right now is we're categorising we're saying well we want this to be a product that offers all the
sort of more tricky features but we want them to be in another area is that right is that what we're
we're doing we're kind of like sorting them an or are we actually eliminating things we just don't want the product to have
yeah
yep
well one one way i would look at this um would be that we a approach the different controls
in terms of um like control types so that for the user it's very clear what they want to do where they go
uh and also think maybe a little bit about sorta w w what would just wanna be acc easily accessible for example
if we had audio controls those could be something people set up very rarely maybe they're un they're they're they're in a little area
but covered up um things like channel and volume um
are used all the time so we just have them right out on top um very just
very sort of self explanatory um so maybe we need to think about having three or
more groupings of controls you know like one which are just the the habitual ones that should be right within your natural
grip and others that are uh also available and then others that are concealed something like
that
yeah
mm hmm yeah
sure
can this can this pl reach can this plug come across no
so why don't i just pick up and move then
here i'll just
why don't i just

mm er can you go up behind me kinda this is so this i'm all in a knot now
okay
um so i can i can say already i dunno whether this is for good or for bad but there'll be a lot of
kind of uh redundancy in the in the the issues and the the uh
the things yeah yeah which is ma not necessarily a bad thing but may what i've already started doing is cr i created a slide
in in my presentation here so um so that we kind of
think well what's the cumulative effect of what we've taken from your ideas and and mine because certainly i i have a hard time
separating separating things completely obviously obviously what you've just told me what you've just told me impacts
a lot on what um like market research mm that that i've been so how do i
how do i get this up okay
okay
alright so
f  eight
oh and f  eight okay
mm hmm
okay i think that that's doing it now
uh again
okay
um okay great
okay just um before i bring this up what i'll just say is um what i've what i've done is tried to collect some information so
that i can then relay this to to you guys so that it's now becomes a collective thing and then kind of lead us in the direction
of deciding 'kay what what are our options what should we decide and do you know what i mean so
okay
okay alright that would be
okay so um does that make sense so what i basically got is i just looked into some information and sort
of th tried to think about how how we could review it and how we could and what kind of decisions we could take away from it and then maybe
by the end of just looking at some of these things we can think about what are our priorities 'cause certainly there's lots of different information
to go through so um i'm thinking here about uh primarily about customer needs that we start with the
customer and w you know what they want and what are issues with with um existing products
uh to think about trends and also about try and connect that as you see with the company vision which is about fashion in electronics
um and then as i say uh w we'd like to prioritise our design features from this and um
dunno okay um so this is what i've found here um a lot of this is
new to me so we'll just read through together um users dislike the look and
feel of current remote controls so they find them ugly most people find them ugly um the vast
majority would spend more money for it to look fancy as well we'll see later the vast majority would spend more money for
um slightly more intuitive control such as voice recognition okay i'm gonna we'll look at that in
a second um most people use only a f a very slim portion of all the controls
so i guess what we're looking at here is people want this h technology they tend to use the most simple controls
and overall they find remote controls to be something they don't doesn't really appeal to them
so i think what we're doing is we're trying to take like if for me this is sorta like three different different um
inspirations you know one is that we want uh something that's high tech but we want it to seem easy and in
spite of the primitive side of it and the very high tech side we want it to just be an appealing piece of equipment in people's hands
um frustrations they get lost a lot s as it came up in our last
meeting um takes time to learn how to use them this is uh why i mention when craig was uh showing
us some ideas that we actually try and group controls so d it doesn't just look like a big panel kinda like when you you look at
you know a new computer keyboard or something that is quite explanatory if you want audio if you want visual
then you have those um
and i will admit i don't know what r s i  stands for
uh no that did not come up at all um so here here is another um
sort of a a review here of the main things i also found that most people would uh adults at
least would pay more for voice recognition now apparently we do have access to all the tech cutting edge technology in remote
control so i dunno if that's possible we might consider getting into it um
and and again here as we sort of move m sort of thin start thinking about how we wanna sell
and market this i think a recurring theme here is the company wants it to be wants us to make something that's fashionable and
sleek and trendy um people uh additionally aren't aren't liking the appearance
of their products so we wanna think about as we take all the sort of the techie features how we can um
put that into a unit which is which people like you know they like the aesthetics and the ergonomics
yeah yeah so you know just c looking at what what craig um craig's i
uh ideas are s sorta tell me that maybe what we wanna do is try and um
separate the different things that we wanna include in this so if we do say well we want there to be all the technology will we try
and make that almost be like optional technology you know it's like like i find a lot of t v s
these days something really like about 'em is if you wanna just turn 'em on and off you can but they have little panels where you click and there's just
like tons of features you go through
yeah
yeah that's s that's sort of the um but i i'm my
hope here is that i'm putting out this information so that we can then say okay well how do we collectively move on with it um i
i haven't brought out one specific marketing idea although my sense is that what we should try and think about is
what are the current trends in materials and shapes and styles and then use that but not let that
confine us technologically
so
alright any um comments on all of that
that's uh
yeah
okay
where's the money maybe
yeah and who watches t v 
mm hmm
mm
mm hmm yeah
mm hmm
yeah this this kinda touches on your comments there david these are the age groups which we have information on
and these are this is a table of h what people would pay more for a certain feature just gives us a rough idea of
where the w the will to spend money on t v  equipment is mostly focused around the twenty five age group
sort of young professional kind of mm hmm
uh yeah it's the
yep it does it does fit with the market that we're sort of identifying in terms of
okay
yeah
sure
sure
yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm yeah
yeah yeah
yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
but yeah
yeah sure mm hmm
yeah
if we can
yeah
right
could it be an on off thing like if you want it on yeah
yeah
yeah sure
sure yeah
sure
yeah
sure yep
yep
yeah it's good well it's good to get ideas out while they're fresh in mind um
not
yeah and not losing and also it helps in terms of people not losing this you know they
they're saying oh it's i lose it in the couch like we're kind of what we're b sort of getting in
into here is mating different uh design features together that they
right oh really you've seen one before
right
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm okay
mm hmm
'kay
sure sure
yep
right
and like on the means b since we're on the topic of the technology uh are there any like
what are our options alright what's what i in is this the only way that we go about it or
are there other thin
right
the basic principle of
'kay
right
okay
okay
mm hmm
mm hmm
okay
right
right
right
right
okay
and um just a clarification before we finish this uh does c is our controller is it have the option
of being um on a standard uh frequency as all of the other equipment
so that the one controller can control several pieces of equipment
okay
just to t v  okay
okay
mm hmm mm hmm

yeah
okay
okay
yeah that's good
and is it going to include any of the uh the more advanced features or are we gonna eliminate those
okay r is it is it is it s is it not an option still that we include some things just as a sort of under like sort of under a door or some
'cause what what i'm i'd be a bit worried about is if someone was h had previously developed habits of
expecting to control surround sound or this and that with their controller and then and then they
you know w they get ours and w it's doesn't have that i dunno if that'd be a problem
yeah okay
okay
yeah
right
yeah
'kay okay like that
okay
mm hmm mm okay great
mm hmm
mm hmm

um yeah just i just wanted to ask then before we wrap up shall we agree for sake of um sort of clarity
and when we when we r resume that we'll u use this idea david's proposed where we think of these three sort of buckets
and anything anything we discuss about them is sort of okay we're talking about this shall we do that then okay
great
and and channel
right
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
colour yeah
sure
sure
okay
and then k i suppose quite likely what would happen is in the d device category there might be some which are just like the habitual standard and then others which are maybe a bit more yeah sure okay okay
okay
mm hmm
mm hmm
great
then we get to go find out what was picked up for lunch for us
mm hmm
so sh
i'm a bit confused about uh what's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design uh i is it just uh more detail uh as i understand it
right

how how it will be done
so whe where do we identify the components of our uh product uh
i think it's it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify
the components of our product
okay
hmm












mm

mm hmm
okay
'kay

mm

cool
mm


that's not bad at all yep



thank you
okay um i'll do some
i'll rub the features and let the drawing stay
'kay um my name is gaurav
um my favourite animal one of my favourite animals is a cow i've got no idea how to draw a cow

uh this is going to be
yeah that'll do okay so let let me draw the body first
big round body really skinny legs and they've got a long tail and a long face
and there is some grass there so this is what i like about cows
that they just keeps sitting there eating grass they do not disturb anybody um they're kind of
buddhist in a way so yeah i like cows um
my my role in the project is um uh the industrial designer so i'm supposed
to design all the details of of the product um ho how it works
and whatever it'll mm take during the functional role what are the various functions that have to be performed by it
uh during the um conceptual design what are the various components of it and um
finally i'm not too sure what was the last part um the detailed design
i i guess it will again be the identification of the components and how they integrate with each other
um i'm from india uh i'm doing my p h d  in psycholinguistics i sit at the department of psychology yeah
thank you
that doesn't look like a cow does it

no way
ah okay
uh huh

mm
thank you
mm hmm
mm hmm
i think uh i in the beginning uh one thing was that was mentioned was that it should be mm trendy
user friendly and original so um i think your point is relevant as
far as the originality is concerned that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this
mm
alright
mm

yeah
there is a lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time but will be used ten percent of the time yeah
yep
and then use the
mm

mm
uh we can aim for i mean we can think about all these little things but we can aim for something wi that gives a high battery life
although i don't think that um it's a huge problem for remote controls anyway battery life uh every now and
then you need to replace the batteries um
hmm
yeah
a big learning curve yeah
yeah so i it should kind of fit in as well and the stereotype of a yeah
alright
hmm
why are you looking at me

do i have a choice okay ooh ooh things falling everywhere right okay
cool
okay
so my name's cat and i'm really not very good at this whole drawing malarkey so um
okay
oh good point
ah the eyes always ruin it right okay what do it's eyes like
okay cool um this is a rabbit
yeah i don't think it's furry enough so we'll make it a fluffy rabbit
okay right it's a fluffy rabbit blue rabbits don't come in blue but you know um okay and i like it because it's small and it's fluffy
and one day you'll be able to getical genetically modify them and they will come in pink
okay
i am the um i need my notebook mm ooh top banana thank you okay cool i am the marketing expert um so like
i'm gonna be doing the apparently according to the little guy in the computer that knows everything the
user g requirements specification of the functional design um trend watching in the conceptual design
and product evad valuation in the detailed design um so yeah
um i'm from leicester um second year um what else do you want to know
i like sports um yeah aerobics kickboxing spinning um and uh
not with rabbits no no and vets i like vets as well and yeah um and i like cocktails especially pink ones okay cool

is a bit more impressive than my rabbit i think it needs four legs if it's gonna walk though



they're not just like a big round body and then some really skinny legs and then just some horns




it looks like eeyore

horns draw some horns


is that a lizard
is there a difference

if you right click on it you can

yeah i was looking at the website and the other things that they've made and i like put down some like inspirational
words like that i got from looking at the pictures so the motto is um we put the
fashion in electronics and um so it's something that is sleek and stylish but it's still functional
you know so i'm kind of thinking you know like those phones that they have the
new generation ones where they don't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that
you know so something heading towards that so it's not overly i mean i don't know what h most of the buttons do on my remote controls so i figure how many do you need you know
okay
something that's a little less crowded than this like i mean you know theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your t v 
right but what do most people do they turn it on they watch certain specified channels you know and then
they turn it off again sometimes they play a movie
yeah so
there's no need to have buttons on it to do that maybe to do
yeah
so if you're the kind of sad case that knows how your remote control works then you know that's fine and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons which just confuse them hmm
'cause like if you look at the train it's just very like there's no extra bits on it the train on the website
and i dunno if you can put it up on the thing um but it is just like a long like thing
used for mu moving people but it looks really pretty too
mm hmm
okay
so this is uh first meeting of
this design project um and i um like to show you the agenda for the meeting i don't know if it was sent round to all of you
maybe not anyway this is the the plan for today's meeting is um
firstly just to introduce the project briefly um although i'm sure you've actually
got some of the information already then the main purpose is to so that we get to know each other a little
bit more um then we want to practice using some of the tools that
we'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings um specifically the whiteboard
over there um then we need to go through the specifics
of our project plan um and discuss come up with some preliminary
ideas about it
and then that's it so we've got twenty five minutes to do that that's until eleven twenty five
s so any any questions is i
not at this point
so this is our project what we're aiming to do is to create a new
remote control for a television um we want it to be something original
something trendy and also something user friendly so it has to be quite
intuitive that people are able to use this product
the method that we're going to use to
complete the project that has three components as such there's the
functional design of the the remote control we're going
the way we'll do that i think is to to work individually initially and then come together for
meetings to to work on that
um similarly with the conceptual design we'll start off by working individually with our own expertise on our own laptops and then we'll bring what we've done together
um and then the detailed design will come after that we'll pull it all together
i think it th w we're talking the the functional design is more your
um area of things where you'll be we want to look at what functions we need in the remote
control and what what specific things it it has to do but the conceptual design is
um perhaps bigger than that and includes the how people are going to use it and and
that kind of thing
um i think we'll we'll start that initially with the functional design already but then yeah
okay so that's just a brief overview of the p the the project itself um
what i'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and
start using some of the tools that we're using for for the project specifically the
whiteboard
so each person in turn i'd like us to go up to the whiteboard
the pen's just underneath it there and draw your favourite animal
and then tell everyone what the f your favourite characteristics of that animal are and while you're doing that
tell us your name what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you're taking
in this project
would you like to go first
oh yeah p put them in pockets
you don't have to hurry we've got plenty of time

it's got no eyes
i thought it might be a cat

yeah i can see by the ears

mm

excellent and what's your what's your role within the team

mm hmm
and more about yourself you're from
mm hmm

but not with rabbits
excellent to match the rabbit
there's a an if you have not enough room there's an eraser there and you can rub it off


ah it looks like a dog
the other legs are on the other side

and where where are you from
estonia

good luck
mm

it's eating
yeah



excellent
right now now it's my turn obviously
okay here's a space
yeah i like the cow i'm jen
um i like dogs too but i can't do that already because i can't draw a dog as well as you can i like
mm
hmm
it's a gecko
yeah
they're
yeah they're l it's a kind of lizard and i i like geckos because they remind me of warm
places and and where i was living in cambodia they used to live
in my house and they were on the ceiling and they would make little gecko noises in the evening
i don't like snakes i come from australia and we have nasty snakes that's where i'm from australia
i'm from melbourne and i'm your project manager
for today and my role is basically to keep things going
and make sure that you all work together
in a productive way so that by the end of the day we come up with a great product
okay

so let's see what's next in the powerpoint presentation
so i've just thought yeah i've just thought about this that we could even put it much more
professionally as there we go okay so this is the um
overall budget for our
project we've got um we're planning to sell these remote controls for let's make that go away that means we've got five minutes um we're planning to sell the remote controls for twenty five euros each
um and with that we're aiming for a profit of fifty million euros
and that's selling them on the international market not just in the u k 
um so to do that our finance people estimate that we need production costs of maximum twelve and a half euro so that we can reach that
profit target
so that's something to keep in mind while you're designing
okay
hmm
this is let me just skip ahead to see that's the last thing okay we've only got a couple of minutes
does anyone have any first ideas to bounce around about um what we're thinking
of this remote control
mm hmm
i think that's probably something that w it's best if we take away with us but if we all have a think
when we go away from the meeting what specific things could be um
included in this remote control that that are out of the ordinary
something something new
mm hmm
mm hmm
uh huh
mm hmm
so perhaps some sort of menu based thing or
mm hmm
yeah

yeah
yeah
so no it could be one button for a menu or something if you really need to go and do that

mm hmm
excellent
oh i haven't had a look yet yep
mm hmm
great any other immediate thoughts before we
move along
mm hmm
yeah
mm hmm
it's like those fancy websites
that you can't access because you have no idea how to get in but the designers thought they were great
okay so we need to wrap it up now so that we can go away and get on with some of this um we've got another meeting in thirty minutes so
you're you'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace but im basically you're looking at the working design
you're looking at the technical functions design
and for you it's the user requirements specification like you said at the start
okay
thanks for that
uh i'll see you in half an hour
carry the laptops back again do we need to unplug things probably
 
 
 
 
 
mm yeah i didn't receive it yet
not at this point



yeah well origi uh at first i thought it was going to be cat
yeah now i now i understand now yeah
yeah

ah
okay um so my name is maarika where's the pen okay
yeah well or i can make it smaller uh so um um i'm the interface
designer in this project and my favourite animal i m i mean i'm not so sure because i'm not so
so very um familiar with all kinds of animals but i do like dogs oh sorry maybe i should have shouldn't
have said it beforehand but mm hmm
um well there are different kinds of dogs but okay um
okay
yeah maybe it has some colourful patches yeah um yeah and i do like dogs because they are good friends to people and they are loyal
mm well that's compared to some other animals like cats um they're really much more fun because they are not so independent um
yeah maybe maybe the fact that they protect their home as well yeah
um what it has to do with with my role in the project is hard to say uh i hope to be loyal to the project and
not to n not to um let people doing similar projects know
the details of our project or something yeah i'm from estonia uh
yep um so is there anything else you'd like to know oh right my roles
um so um in the different um stages of the design
so at first i will be responsible for um for yeah
designing the technical functions of the um
um of the remote control uh then in the in the conceptual design stage
i need to um come up with uh interface concept and then in
the last um stage i will be responsible for the int infa for the user interface design
okay that's it



thanks
it looks very very cute
yeah
mm hmm


wow
ah a gecko okay is a ar are they also like lizards or are they yeah they are mm hmm
ah
mm hmm i hope you don't like snakes do you
okay
mm hmm
wonderful

yep i'm just wondering whether whether there is like any special feature that we want to have w want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones
mm hmm
yeah but uh i mean e even though it has to be re original we shouldn't uh go like too far away from from the usual ones because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems with l learning yeah yeah
hm hmm
okay thank you
see you
play doh's edible did you know that it's definitely
yeah
it's it's chew proof
yeah
yeah
right everybody everybody ready okay let's have your um let's get have the uh presentation
nice

mm hmm
mm hmm
what button um oh mute
okay
that certainly does
mm
mm
yeah
's great
i have one thing about it but it's a small thing but it'd mean we'd have to make a right handed one and a left handed one
but that's i don't see why that's not possible
yeah they make left handed scissors you know
yes s
mm sure sure
yeah
yeah
but um other than that i mean uh and that's um you know that's just something i think i think it's great yeah great idea
i think it's well if the r r  motto is we bring fashion to to electronics i'd say that could be quite fashionable
yeah
yeah
yeah very good yeah it's come up with what we've you know the things that's what we've what we were looking at doing hasn't it all seems to be there well done
um before we move on
i need that cable thank you yeah um
one thing i do need to do we need to look at is the costs
well yeah
um
yeah
uh right okay now i think we'll do this i could
do you know i can do this o on my own or i could do it with you but it's just easy enough to go through it with you so
we're going for the kinetic power
and the electronics we decided on it being just a simple the easiest
thing that's inside it ooh so the case we've gone for the double curved
um
and it's made out of rubber
the interface is push buttons
and button supplements well they're in diff special colours aren't they so special colours
special form yeah they're a special form there in shapes and stuff
yep yeah um
are they made out of any special material no they're not they're not made out of wood or titanium or rubber or anything they're just simple
okay right so let's see if that comes within budget
and it does that is gonna cost uh yeah that's gonna cost ten
ten euro seventy cents a unit to make and our target was it had to come in at under twelve fifty
so
this is all very very good the bosses will be very pleased okay let's just save this so i can e mail it to you uh
save it in save it in the uh my documents
splendid okay
so uh that's done with this with this um doodah so you're gonna do what you were gonna do
your evaluation

f  eight
i love the smell of that play doh
i cou
i would give it a seven
oh sorry one d yeah
yeah
yeah but that's not a technological thing that's another thing i that's another marketing thing so on the technical side of it it
easy to use i'd say it's i wouldn't not if you're left handed it's not
i would give it a i would give it a two 'cause i i it i it i it is more geared for right handed people than left handed people but
yeah
give it a t give it a two
cost it's come in under budget so that's a definite one
amount of buttons
contains only the necessary buttons yeah
so it's anti r s i 
i don't think it's gonna get lost easily
two
i mean it
no i mean
i mean you could still flush it down the toilet theoretically but
okay
alright it's all all systems go
we can't fail

well done reissa
okay i i think um i just wanna put in as project manager
the you know little bit of praise for everybody here for how they've worked on it you know both individually and
as a team you know you've w everyone's come up with their own individual ideas in their own different departments
um and then come together and worked in you know integrally you
know at the right times psp you know especially you two that's all you know
gone very very well and and and be you know has been good communication going on
did you have to go down to the the corporate squash court and bash a few balls about

fantastic
i think so i i you know and i think we've co we have come we've come up with something new something that hasn't been done before we haven't we're not just rehashing an old design
yeah
you know maybe this isn't a simulation maybe this is actually so it's like sony or someone like that they're they're just yeah they get
yeah yeah two years' time this will be on the market ex exactly that product um thum we'll go yeah we designed that and no one will believe us but um
no i think when this meeting's finished like officially there b we'll get a uh questionnaire to fill in or six uh
i haven't got message
it gets handed over to another department what our what our project was was to come up with the
product basically the for the and just basically is it it come can is
it within budget when it c when it comes to all the other things of how to sell it and you know the b the profits
and all that that's other departments it's another team that actually work out the mai the
oh yeah the all the guys in the profit sharing yeah
um
yeah that's it you know we've we've we've made i we've made we've designed the product we've ma
we've got the prototype it's within budget it's does everything that we wanted it to do
it's new it's it's um
something that uh that isn't out there already
yeah well this is very marketable in that it is it's it's something that's kind of new and looks a bit quirky for people who want that it's that it's um hang on i wrote it down here somewhere
oh no i thi i put it in one of my e mails that i sent off um that you know
it's marketable in the sense that it's whilst all these other remotes uh actually do give you repetitive
strain injury our one does the complete opposite you know so that's something that's new
which is one of the criteria they asked us to come up with something with something new
yeah and if you're not having a good time with the t v  you can f throw it about you know it's fine it's kid proof
well you can break the ornaments but you won't break that yeah so all in all i think we've done very well well done everybody
um drinks are on the company
in the corporate bar that's next to the corporate swimming pool on the top floor that we're that've all just gained access to yeah
that's it well as far as i t as far as i know um
no anyone wanna play i spy
yeah i guess i mean we're gonna get asked to fill out another questionnaire
um
it's probably gonna be the same as one we've done before
but i'm not the authority to say that it is
um how does everyone feel about the technology that's been used in this the sort of using of the the pens and writing on these special pads and all that


yeah
i thi you know i'd i'd n yeah as we said earlier i've not never seen that before something that t the whiteboard
thingy that's great
um but a p a pen with a camera on it i don't think it's such a new thing i mean it's i or
in such a new idea it would be different if it was sort of hand writing recognition
stuff but as it's not it's literally that'll come up on a computer screen as a picture file rather than actual
text
yeah yeah mm

yeah
i used to eat it
yep

we've got a cool prototype
double curved
which is ant anti r s i 

oh right yeah
yeah i know i know people who have left handed and right handed people in the family and they all use the computer for the whole the same computer the fes family and they have a mouse and everybody is using right handed mouse
imagine d are you right handed
imagine you're doing it with your left hand i don't think it's too
but we can have both uh
yeah
i think it does
yeah
there you go
play doh is very cheap
chew proof

oh ho ho
yep

rubber
yeah
mm hmm
a one
well the kinetic thing yeah
well so the um
yeah
yeah yeah true
two
yeah
mm
yeah
yeah
yes s yeah
it's yellow

two
t
mm mm
we've we've done well

well
you know

it is
y
oh really

mm yep
cool
glad to hear that


yeah
yeah

i've i've definitely eaten it before i didn't know was edible
actually that makes sense because i remember like peopl i dunno if my mom ever did it but i remember other people's moms making like home made play doh where you just like make the colouring and make some sort of sort of dough
mm hmm
yeah
we've got some
yeah it's pretty exciting so
everything uh that we wanted we wanted it to be ergonomic and to be made out of rubber
very simple and easy to use yeah double curved um but also
something that was gonna jump out at people something that would be different uh separate it from the other remotes
out on the market so uh i think if you put this in the palm of your hand you'll see
what a nice thing we have going here
so basically
if you hold it like that the one on your thumb yeah the thumb button is the power button
your index finger is channel up middle finger is channel down ring finger is volume up your pinkie is volume down
that's the lock button has a l  l  on it and then the m  is a mute button and then it also has digit
for muting the uh
um and then then you can also there's a numeric keypad on the top so you can key directly to the
to the channel if you want so it's really basic functionalities as far as what keys are available but we think it's very
comfortable and very innovative and it looks different
so all the i mean the important keys are right at your f f you know right at uh at a convenient place for you to to access them so you don't you
yeah it should be and it's also conformable to the size of your hand i mean if that's too big it's a rubber remote so you can you know
change that so d does that uh what mesh with what you guys were hoping and for and expecting or does it
ah that's good thinking yeah
yeah if we build rocket ships why can't we build left handed and right handed uh remotes
yeah i didn't i didn't think about that but i'd yeah
uh huh
yeah
do you think it says r r 

fashion to electronics yeah
yeah and it's got the b the black and yellow and blue
plus red which is sort of a a fruit and vegetable uh uh
so that's that's our end of things wha uh
that's
yeah
the costs was that what you said

but it's edible

that was the main criteria from the last meeting it had to be chew proof
yeah
yeah i mean these these ones on the side are curved kind of so
the buttons are rubber
that's cool
yeah yeah
and we're actua actually making a better profit than we expected

yeah have some have some
mm hmm
mm
yeah
oh sorry one
yeah
that was our main technological innovation w every everything else was fairly simple but the fact that we used the kinetic energy was new
it's ergonomic but that's not that's that's a design that's a des that's a design thing yeah
it's about in the mid in the middle somewhere maybe yeah i dunno
maybe three yeah
yeah
mm
okay
if we're gonna have one left handed and one right handed then i would give it a one but otherwise otherwise a two
yeah that was great
yeah
it is very bright yeah
it's not the kinda thing that's gonna slip like between a couch cushion or something you know
maybe it will uh
you think it could lost
mm
okay
yeah anything i mean okay it's bigger than the average mobile i guess
but yeah it can get lost
yeah okay yeah two is fine
yeah yeah
yeah
mm

yeah
yeah during our design i mean there was some s some heated heated discussion but we we kept we tried to keep it cool and and
just just
we just had to we just had to squeeze our product a little bit and
now you guys have been a a great team think we're the we're the envy of all the of all the other r r  teams
yeah i think they're actually trying to find ideas for a ideal remote




so at this stage i mean is this the last meeting of the project we don't uh have another one after it's gone gone to marke market or something

so there's no way to like predict what our 'cause we had a we originally had a
as far as our financial uh um goals we had a specific number for profits that we wanted it was fifty mil fifty million
i don't remember but there's not a way to compute that i mean since we saved on the on the production cost do we know how much we're making on profit
uh
hmm
but we have a vested interest prof profit sharing
i think actually and one advantage of of this is that after the uh you know after this fad
of fruit and vegetables passes this will still be c a cool remote you know we're not we're not you
know tying tying our cart to that one horse

mm
mm
mm
it make watching t v  healthy

uh
right you too


mm
that's it
i guess it's probably better that we wrap it up than have five minutes of
silence
should we call the day then
uh right
mm hmm


your moment to shine
right i think they do want to do hand writing recognition on that it's just the first step

i guess we should end this since we're off off topic
so shall we
right
it's play doh
because kids yeah
but um it's it's made edible 'cause yeah
it's made edible 'cause kids eat it and if it's wasn't edible then
well normal babies
oh yeah it is yeah oh yeah

that is cool
what's the big blue thing
oh cool
and mute


oh it's so cute
yeah but then
but then you can learn to use your right h like i was just thinking if there's left handers and right handers in the family what they have two remotes
yeah i'm sure they'll be able to
i mean it's only pressing buttons you don't have to do anything you know extraordinary i think everybody can press a button with their left and right hand so
yeah it's not
yeah
have them in stock
make 'em more appealing as well
and all the playing around is uh
yeah i'm just do you wanna plug in okay
mm
play doh won't last very long everybody'll go like oops it's gone
mm hmm mm hmm
well they'll buy more of them if you eat them
yeah
yeah
it's better for
and special material
well they're rubber aren't they
we're under budget

it's already saved i think
thank you
mm
oh yeah this is where we all get to i get to write on the oops on the board right oh
's function
okay
mm
okay so evaluation we're gonna do it all together so we evaluate each criteria
i've got the criterias and we have to do it on a scale of one to seven one being true so it's
it's more like it's fits the criteria and seven being as in it doesn't fit the criteria
and the criterias are and i'll draw this up on the board
so we have a box
and this is false this is just like
to keep you informed so seven's here and one's here and then you've got in the middle
so the first criteria do you all get what we're doing okay cool okay first criteria look
and feel so the does remote look and feel fashionable to what we talked about as it is it colour wise
and is it spongy so what mark should we give for that
as in it's not
a one a one so i'll just write criteria criteria one we get
one second criteria new technology have we implemented
new technology as in the new high tech
so it's
so we'll give it a

yeah
i'd say it's about a a twoish two three
three
so criteria three is is it easy to use i think it's a one i think
two so it's
but if we make a right handed and a left handed then
yeah
yeah okay 'kay criteria four is costs 's great
yeah
like the amount of buttons 'cause people like a lot le like
so it's a one
um criteria six r s i  is it good against yes very good it's one and criteria seven which is the last one does it get lost is it easy to get lost
no but it is smallish
mm i think i it would could be could get lost
mm yeah i mean it's not fully it's not fully like you can't say i mean it's not a one definitely
yeah
the mobiles get lost all the time
but then you ring 'em and you find them so
yeah so that's that
so that's the evaluation so i'd say
yay
it's like like a number one um
number one product
all done thanks
we fitted all the criterias yeah
yeah so
so that's that one




been cool

in four diff in in four meetings funny all designer meetings could be this quick

they're using our ideas


yeah


just start summarising now
you can reply to the same message
see summary there if you just reply to that one
was it was it fifty or five
depends how much we sell
we finished an hour earlier
mm
mm
definitely
yeah
just don't sh don't throw it at any of the ornaments and break them
no
yay

yep
we haven't got the five minute left thing yet
mm mm
in project
i love it i love it i think it's cool being all wired up and a vibrating pen and it's cool
being watched um

wow
mm
logitech
yeah
meeting adjourned
like that okay cool
okay
right so i'm just gonna start this powerpoint real quick yeah powerpoint yeah well you know
yeah i kinda like this i'm kinda getting into it right um so just to kick off the meeting basically um so we're working now for a real reaction this is uh so it right
just got an agenda to set out what we're gonna try to accomplish in this particular first meeting um
we're gonna just do a quick opening and we can hopefully all get acquainted with one another um then we're gonna start talk a little bit about tool training
essentially that means getting used to the only thing that we haven't tried out yet the whiteboard um
we've got a general plan for the project how we're gonna go about accomplishing this and then just a bit of discussion close up
um i guess you know game or something um in real life um
so yeah basically
i want to i'm just gonna you got of course you can discuss that i'm thinking about um uh proposing that
since we've got this weird blend of ourselves and our roles that we just
don't ask don't tell um so um if you say something about marketing right sorted
um y is
exactly um i mean obvi if if you guys if if at the same time if you like logically if something doesn't like if i'm like we're gonna sell a remote control that's the size of this paper book you know
um you say like well that doesn't seem like such a good idea because of x  obviously go with it i mean we'll discuss it but
i'm not gonna ask do you know that or uh yeah it seems like yeah yeah exactly so 'cause we're what we're sort of role playing is y g yeah you're gonna tap into your own knowledge as well um
and that's the same for your when we do introductions i mean um and you talk about your background you know have fun you know maybe you went to um
uh you know maybe i you're like in maine you went to u c s b  but you wanna say you went to harvard or something like that why not you know you can this is you know i guess we can have a little bit of fun with it so are you guys okay with that does that seem logical
sweet
cool so i guess that that we're totally we're making a remote control which is thrilling
um uh but the idea is that we can make something based on the whole corporate
model i dunno if you guys had time to check the in real life i dunno if you guys uh checked the um uh
the corporate website
um we've got to make something as fashionable as possible that's kind of the corporate strategy
is we're gonna try to take ordinary stuff that nobody really thinks about and try to make it nice you know like john
lewis nice or you know if you go to debenham's or something
so um basically we are reinventing the wheel but we wanna try to do it in a user friendly
um slick sleek kind of way um way we're gonna go about doing that
is basically at first we're gonna start on the basics
and that's where i'm gonna need you guys the user interface designers and the um um the
other designer that i can't remember the the i d  and the u i d  right um the industrial
designer hey right on alright getting into it um
to guide me and guide us on this project 'cause you're gonna be you're g you guys are the bottom you know you're like no you can't do that you can't have you know x  and y  um at the same time
and then um we'll work up from what is necessary to more like what would be good
you know like um i i think you guys probably got the same emails i did but the idea of um
yes a coffee pot needs to be able to hold coffee but it's also better if it's not like
really cheap glass so that it if you touch it you hurt your hand or something like that
um and so we'll work up from there and um then we'll meet on and talk about it and then finally we'll incorporate
as kind of the last stage you know where you guys build or tell me tell us what's possible and then you tell
us what we can um hope for and what way to go take the the the
take the basics and make it nicer and then ov obviously uh the u i d  and the i d  you know you you can keep on the you know sort of at the cutting edge of how to get about maximising what is possible
um to try t of sync it all up so that's the detailed design so it's a three stage kind of thing um right so for now just for th the white board um
basically uh just to get used to it i haven't tried it yet either um i'm just gonna start and um mm carry like five remotes around
um and just write down i'm just gonna write down one of the names of my um desert discs
you know if you if you were trapped on a desert island and you could only bring five c d s along with you name one of them that you could
not all five if you wanna write all five go for it but name one of them that you could um oh we skipped introductions
nice
i'm a excellent project manager um i'm marty um i went to uni at uh u c  santa barbara and i'm here working on a p h d  in psychology um yeah so
expert don't play yourself down
expert
where did you go to uni nathan oh brilliant cool my little brother goes there right so desert island discs yeah
well i'll t i no no yeah i'm just gonna write a couple of 'em down see i'm a big music fan i don't know if you guys are i'm assuming everybody likes music to some lesser or greater extent but
there's some other options if you're a t v  slut like i am like smallville terrible television show but i happen to love it it's rubbish but i love it
t the the main c the main character wow
is he a wanker
he looks really tall like he's gotta be like six six yeah um okay so
i really like jeff buckley you guys heard of jeff buckley um that's cool 'cause like
not very many people have um and um oh well i might as well throw a british person in there
um you can't go wrong with radiohead it's a r
okay so it really works just like a pen only makes noises i think it's kinda weird anyway yeah yeah
you're like press and it's kinda cool you'll see alright so um whoever wants to get up next you can write
down some telly that you watch or whatever you want
right on
w
mm
nice
okay yeah yeah
well yeah oh family guy isn't h has h do you watch the new season
i think i'm gonna start downloading it yeah
mm mm
afro beat orchestra very cool mm
wow
that's what a powerpoint presentation is for it's they're designed specifically to ignore i it's th brilliant
ah yes yes yes okay i see that vomit yes street pizza it's so brilliant
i've seen more urine in this city than ever before i mean
it's so minging
uh
i'm going local going local i have to be here for three years so i might as well get the terminology right
oh have you been home yet they'll be like say something british and you're like oh shut up family
right you s you're gonna stay here
wow
bad religion
yeah yeah yeah
well yeah that's why yeah
i miss coffee burritos
oh yeah two two bucks
where are you from in california by the way
did you really what part
yeah i'm from san diego as well
yeah oh man
going to s like north carol i'm sorry you you just can't get a better burrito than what's available in the s in san diego
well it's it's i there's other things too there's you just can't place it like i when i went to school in the u  in santa barbara which is central california
the mexican food is okay it's just not good like and yeah it's like two bucks like literally two bucks for this massive i miss yeah good call on that
um just literally just metropolitan san diego i live like five minutes from the zoo so north park actually if you want to get real specific
yep
yes on university yeah yeah it's actually like literally half a mile from my house yeah pretty cool small world as we were discussing before
especially when we're all from the same general region right so okay success on the whiteboard you can harness the awesome power a little bit introductions we talked about some of our c d s and things we like about the city you know i think we'll
um right so moving on to not fun stuff uh project finance um basically what we're trying to do is sell this remote for twenty five euros um
this is what the finance department has told me the c f o  but i don't know i'm not sold on this it's pretty dear i mean twenty f that's like you know
forty bucks for a remote it would have to pretty much like do my laundry for me um so what we can maybe work on that a later but we're gonna make a lot on it the profit aims to make fifty million euros on it
eur internationally so um one of the things i i was gonna mention to you um you guys the designers is that um it m we probably need a rever it needs to be a universal remote control probably
um so something that could do n t s c  as well as pal as well as various other formats like if it's gonna control d v d s but um you know i'll leave that to you guys but that's something that i i it is gonna be an international sold thing
um but we wanna try to make it for twelve fifty so we wanna try to make a hundred percent profit on it if we can
um s right so um just to close up i'm not sure how much time i've used mm next time right project manager sorted um
is uh we'll meet in another half an hour or so um and i'd like the um industrial designer to get ge think about what needs to be done like what the basic function of it
um u i d  well yeah you right g your assignments are up there and you'll also get s assignments from in your email as well more spec specifics on what do do
um mm basic and um so i need you to tell us what um we what the user's gonna want
so actually in a way you guys c maybe in our next meeting chat a bit about what the user's gonna want
and what the user can have you know like uh so
yeah well it is and we'll discuss the trade offs in between um so yeah specific instructions will be sent in your email but i think that that is more or less a good place to start for now um
and as more things come up we'll have meetings and you'll get emails and so forth um any questions before we get started
you mean to like
hmm
yeah

well have a think about it i mean i'm i'm certainly op it seems like yeah it it seems like it's certainly do able isn't
it i mean um or if we can't have a full mobile phone maybe a remote that has some other kind
of useful function the clapper no i mean no good idea good idea
we'll see what see what
uh huh y i like that
yeah that's true i guess we we probably have some time maybe we should brainstorm a bit like what we wanna do go back to um
i don't really have any let me bring up something about
our basic goals here what we want to accomplish uh project announcement
ts ts ts


yeah not so much
all right we'll find them we're on our own
yeah yeah let's do it let's do
i'm gonna go ahead and take notes on this too 'cause
yeah i mean oh yeah right so initial ideas
yeah

mm hmm
yeah that's slick isn't it i mean like stylist yeah like a just a yeah
right so we got five minutes more to chat about this perfect um so we've got this kind of an idea of a trade off between um
uh size and functionality um and we also
i'm also gonna note for future reference this idea of um so you like maybe like an l  like a touch screen type of remote
i don't think one exists be a good idea
yeah all the other universal remotes um i don't know if there's such a thing out there i guess we could do some uh do some
research on or one of us could do some research on it about whether or not there are um multi format
like um you know pal n t s c  region one
okay
okay
interesting okay
okay okay

um all right so i li i'm liking that idea this idea of a touch screen remote with multi format features um
um
let's see
mm

uh let's see um
yeah yeah okay
think they're just called face plates i don't know

um
mm but if we're bundling it unless we're selling their telly with the remote
um
cou could we not do something where like just a little lit like literally just a very small kind of thing that comes with the remote
that you could place something else that you press and it makes the remote page kinda like how on a lot of um uh cordless
regular phones you have a page button and it goes could we do something like that
um yeah i think this material quality as well like i guess what we can think about what kind of um uh you know apple 's been really successful with this surgical white kind of business or this sleek kind of you know
yeah
yeah we do have the minimum am amount i mean we were talking finances i dunno selling a a forty pound remote would h or
a forty dollar remote twenty five euro remote would be pretty you know it's pretty expensive so maybe we
might wanna trade off some of the features for a lower price
without without getting into that whole like you know go down to bargain store remote you know bargain store universal remote that's black and you know m massive some kind of i dunno a balance there in somewhere
but um have a think about what we can do have a think about what we want to do how we're gonna sell it and um
mm
twenty five euros
yeah they're all weaker than they're all stronger than the dollar
although computer parts all if you're gonna upgrade your computer buy it in the states like um do you guys know fry's huge computer uh electronics store
they serve um right they sa tha s they will sell things overseas so you can buy stuff in america and have it shipped over for like twenty thirty pounds about
right so um let's go ahead and wrap that up here for now i'm
gonna put these initial ideas that we've got in the um project documents
so if you guys wa need a reminder about what we've talked about um the different
you know kind of trade offs that we've got and the other ideas you can consult them at your leisure
and uh right so thanks for that let's just uh head back to work on what we were talking about bef uh goi h h getting into
um yes
thanks guys

guess i should probably try to sit up straight
oh i think mine's fallen off

wow



oh yeah that's fine
right


i'm nathan i'm from california and i'm here doing a masters degree in social anthropology
u c l a  yeah
okay

mm hmm

wow

no
sounds nice
oh wow


there's more vomit there
alright yep
um
let's see
yeah that's the music i grew up listening to
and so there
something i miss about my hometown
burritos
that cost less than eight pounds
i grew up in san diego but yeah um la jolla p b 
but really uh i last lived in san francisco i haven't lived in cali well i haven't lived in southern california since i was eighteen
it's different 'cause in san diego th the tortillas are cooked on the grill and in northern california they steam them
yeah it really does
mm
yeah where you from in san diego
okay
yeah my grandparents lived on um thirty second
close t uh do you know where clare de lune coffee shop is and
cafe forte
cool
yeah
wow
okay
mm sounds interesting
maybe our personal coach will have something to say about that
yeah
maybe a remote with changeable faces like the faces that you can buy for phones yeah

yeah
s smaller's better simple
oh right that'd be different

yeah it's gonna be too complicated too crowded with buttons and things
needs it needs one outstanding feature to set it apart from all the other remotes
right
i think making it out of a nice material would be very important because so many of those remotes that you see these universal remotes look so cheap and low quality
mm


something uh we'll have to come up with a name patent it

leopard print
i think it wouldn't be such a bad idea to have a like a locator device maybe a simple button that you have on your television to help you find your remote
mm
true
yeah
i think so
yeah
mm
yeah
yeah
's true

okay
alright
how're we placed in terms of the alright

it fell
that's why

ah


sure

mm


i'm ron i uh once upon a time studied in victoria and i am the user interface designer






go for it

alright think i'm just gonna put down one uh one c d 
anybody no no afro beat orchestra very cool yeah fift s
they like fifteen members from brooklyn um and i'm hoping to go to the concert in belgium in brussels
in april first yeah it's supposed to be in brussels anyways um thing i love about
edinburgh

love um
i just came from glasgow and i'm um happy to say that there's the there's the same quantity approximately um i w
does uh yeah ready minging nice

uh huh

nice

nice




i assume that we're building a stand alone uh remote control we can't kind of build it into other uh products
for instance like a mobile phone or something like that
or or you know can we produ can we sell a remote control phone for twenty five pounds or less
yep okay
mm hmm

nice hot
now are we also discussing kind of our initial ideas at all here
s does anybody have any initial ideas
but i'm thinking i'm thinking kind of p d a  uh design so touch screen design rather than button so that you can kind of flip around all sorts of different things

too confusing
mm hmm possibly
i'm pretty sure there is i mean i i have a friend who has a p d a  that he just
points at his telev any television he wants and it'll figure out the the specifications of it
and will control it um so i th i assume that that can be done with uh kind of around the world
oh
i like the idea of the uh multi plate in in
i like we should c we should come up with a fuzzy one as well for those cold winter days
well if we bundle it as a phone then you can always call it if you're not doing that then we can have something that just kind of rings from either well there used to be those whistling devices but that's a little bit annoying
th
yeah
that's cool
i think we could design into that
curves
we're talking twenty five pounds or twenty five euros

slight difference i guess
no
thank you
are you sure i got it all head's kinda small okay
we're okay
we're good
i guess it's gonna be hard to drink coffee mm uh okay
very official
you're just gonna believe me we'll go from there fair enough
prove it yeah okay

works for me


there you go

i'm sarah i went to michigan and i'm here doing cultural studies and i'm the marketing manager or something marketing yeah expert expert fine that's me
so
so do we have to wait for you to write it down or are you gonna tell us i'm waiting to know
uh
fair enough
oh smallville i went to high school with tom willing actually
the guy yeah
yeah very much so hell of a soccer player but a total bastard nonetheless
yeah he is a big guy yeah
mm hmm
good call
interesting

i guess i'll go next then okay don't wanna lose all my mikes plugged in here okay this is basically just pen practice huh okay oh you're much taller than me so i'm gonna write down here
um
right now i'm listening to a lot of somebody nobody's ever heard of chris bathgate local michigan folk singer really lame and uh
uh what else did i bring with me
probably classical to totally geek it out yeah i think
and my family guy d v d s but we don't need to write that one down so yeah
no are you getting it online or is it on sky yeah that'd be nice
'fraid not
mm
exciting
that'd be
oh i didn't even read those
oops i shouldn't admit that
yeah it's the five by five i can't read that much

yeah oh it's so horrible
oh my god seriously
it really is
yeah slide it in there yeah
yeah fair enough
i've already got more than i can keep track of and i'm gonna go home next week and everyone's gonna be like oh my god you're turning into one of those people no
i know i know oh it should be interesting wait until i tell them i'm not coming back
they're gonna love that one
probably or at least get a work visa for a while and then decide
'cause nice
of course
oh now i can think of so many other ones
that's how it works
mm oh
any thing that are like free
nice
it must make all the difference
ah
right
mm
there you go

mm
makes sense
uh
what they're looking for
and negotiate that uh
i don't think there's any rules about it yet so
yeah
mm
w yeah

i like the little cover thingies
hmm
good idea start your minutes um
well it's pretty much given it's gonna be universal right we decided that already and it may be functioning for other things
as soon as you said that i was thinking like all the other things you could get a remote to do like your microwave or your front door or like to have everything on one thing but then i've never been a fan of those huge remotes that have like a million buttons you can't tell what they do
yeah
specific
okay
interesting
true
mm
mm right we want it to be munt multifunctional but at the same time if you get it to do too much you're not gonna be able to tell them apart that whole yeah
hmm
mm
an interesting option
yeah
definitely
right
that
yeah
awesome
yeah
mm hmm
yeah
yeah keeping it nice and slick would be important and
i don't know like there's such a problem with losing them that adding this whole like p d a  pen business is only one more thing to lose so we're gonna have to be careful with what like
just something like keep in mind when we start actually dealing with this stuff but that would be really cool
yeah fi b like what are they called those face plate things isn't there a name for them are they i dunno
yeah something really cool
leopard print or something
hmm
true
right
true
right
right
right
probably
good
mm
yeah and that titanium the new silver sleek ones that's last couple of years very much so
mm
right
right
mm
definitely
yeah
or if you our users in mind like these grandmas are not gonna be into this whole new let's design no it's they're used to the buttons so we'll have to be careful of exactly who we're marketing this to and who we're gonna be able to get it out of
but
euros
mm
mm mm
mm
okay
with half an hour
'kay perfect
cool
okay everybody is ready good morning again so today we are going
to have a f second meeting oh michael hi you're late you have a good reason for that
very good okay let's have a look to the agenda today
so we are going to have a meeting about the functional design um so first before starting i w just going to uh to go quickly to through the minutes of previous meeting
so uh basically we we are not decided if w we should go for a universal
or specific uh uh remote control but i have new um new i inputs for about that
topics i goin i'm going to share with you
and uh basically we decided to um to uh go to individual actions for each of you
uh so um industrial designer should wor was supposed to work on th on th
on the working design you showed us you ar you you prepare something for us
the u i  guy also uh work on that yeah and for the mar our marketing expert should deliver some specs
alright so so we are going to go through three of your individual presentations
but first i would like quickly to uh to decide of to give a name to the project so
i just put d quickly remo but if you have any o other names that
we co could decide for just to to keep something fun for our project
we we should we could discuss quickly any ideas
powerstick yeah
what else
what else
mango mango mando m a 
m a 
m  d o  mm okay
what does it mean
oh
hmm nice
okay
so let's go for mando
yeah no objection
great so
okay i think this is
okay
okay i think this is more a question of of i i think this is more a question of of look and feel something that should be addressed later we should we should go to other for the other topics
yeah okay so let's stick f to man mando for the name and we'll see for the for the look and feel later so let's go for the three presentations right now so who want to start
so maybe we could start with the market yeah
okay so i have your slides somewhere
participant four
this one
s that's coming uh okay great
mm hmm
okay sh next slide okay
mm hmm
okay
yeah

something with the shape of the palm
on the sides
and then finally
yeah first i'm just wondering about the l c d  stuff because uh because
yeah so maybe it's a good time for me to uh to bring you to some new uh new informations
we had the new requirements from the so uh from the head offices of the company
and so they wanted so they want to um they would like to be restricted to t v 
okay i dunno if you had this information already no so they want us to restrict the remote control to t v  only because of time limitations um they want also uh
excellent so we have also to focus more on the internet aspects because well well te teletext is outdated now
and uh finally it should be clear that the corporate image that means colours and logos of the co our company should be clearly inde identified in the product
so
yeah yeah sure sure so maybe we can jump to your presentations right now okay so let's keep in mind about tha that that this last point about l c d  and speech uh reco

sorry what is your
okay michael
sorry
um yeah
the wheel doesn't work

looks like a p d a 
mm hmm

mm hmm

okay can you continue please mi

mm hmm
okay
okay okay thanks
you want to go

this one
great no not that one
you are two
alright
okay sorry to interrupt you but we have seen before that there is a new way of interacting that use wheel
okay

mm hmm
yeah that increases the the cost also
do you think that performance of such systems are enough to to target well of such technologies is enough
okay
well wh uh i imagine also that the microphone will be an ambiance um a um an ambience microphones because you are not going to speak into into th into the remote control so it could be s a few centimetres
yeah
okay
okay we shou we should discuss this la later after after after this this uh slide this is a this is a this is a a very important uh issue in discussion okay next uh that finished
no components
yes sure
okay

okay
so your
your opinion is that we should go for special condition technologies
yeah

okay so
okay gentlemens we have to take some deci decisions right now um so if i if i kind of summarise everything we've de we we said we are targeting t v 
we need we need to have um um remote control which is fanc
fancy which is uh which is easy to to hand not too small not too big um
we have or good shape yes we should bring new technologies for young peoples and
uh as we have uh also requirements to to use uh to to push thr toward
the internet maybe this is something we can stick to it
and um also a very interesting things i i i've seen on on on the one of
the comp o our competitor is this wheel that we can use to navigate so so my feeling
is that re regarding costs budget we have an an an target
price it's not possible to go s to go to l c d 
and also to go to automatic speech recognition technologies uh first m m why not to go
to l c d  because um in fact as we are targeting uh t v  in fact we can
use t v  screen as a screen to feedback to to give some feedback informations about
what we could have
yeah that's right don don't you ha don't we have contacts with uh people on t v  or or well systems that exist that we can use
yeah
yeah that's good point what's what cou what could be the cost of uh well
could we fit the the targets uh in terms of cost uh if we
go s to l c d  on the remote control
yeah
so you mean yo you mean we we should target something maybe which is which would be more expensive but re really fancy
in terms to um in terms to had to have really an added value okay so regarding
the automatic speech recognition i think this is
they have tele teletext
well because they have teletext on it th th you have a teletext sin signal that you can that you can uh that you can get thr through the channel
they have t most of them have teletext but we want to get rid well one of our requirements is to uh to move to teletext to uh to the use of internet so to to uh
to browse more easily the teletext
for instance through uh through your remote control
the ti the start time all the p all the programmes you could have uh o
well i don't know if this information is available from teletext also
well because for the same reason that we cannot
uh informations on the t v  we c we couldn't grab information information which is not there
so so that mean w w we need an in an extra internet connection to use the remote control if you want to browse in addition to the t v  or uh or it should be a special t v  connected to

okay we need to close the meeting um so
very quickly
no yeah well people go to buy another remote control
when they broke n broke their and they want to go t for universal one and they take the fanciest
they can have so this is that we z that that we should target
so the com the um the uh the committment is the following we don't go for
speech recognition technology the l c d  is still on disc is still open to discussion
it is up to you to go through this um uh this way and to to report
report me back next meeting so
yeah but not sure maybe it's cheaper but we have no
okay this is this is an open question for you
yeah this is uh up to you to tell us but i'm definitely not keen on
to to no no no i'm no i'm definit definitely not keen on going to speech
recognition technologies i'm not confident enough i'm not sure that that we'll have a product really that work
i uh that work
it's real yeah how to guarantee such performances is really hard
well this is still is is very bad so this is the end of this discussion next
meeting uh here are the task you have to work on um so you have
to work on the component uh concept uh you have to work on user interface
and you have to go through a trend watching
okay so the question is still open about the l c d  thing
um uh we i hope that next meeting we will uh we'll take some um decision that direction thanks bye
yep
yes
mm
uh the powerstick

maybe a spanish name would work well especially if we're selling into the u s  market becasue there's a lot of spanish speakers there
maybe something that sounds cool in english but sounds funny in spanish mando what is that
what does it mean in spanish
control okay 'cause it also like in english it sounds like you know the man's tool you know because you know men like to have control of the remote so it might

the mando
yeah that's and we could have some like you d you could have the fonts you know special so you have man in like in in uh in one o in one font and then the o  as like
although you don't wanna cut uh cut women out of the uh potential buyers though do you so
yeah
marketing
well that's the thing we need to know who we're selling it to before we can really decide on a
um

yeah
more likely
well th the on the thing is though most remote controls are used by more than one person so
unless you're kind of targeting single people you know you're gonna maybe
cut out some a lot of your market
still shaped for yeah for your hand but not for a particular hand right
well it can still be a you can still extend past the hand
uh
well it means like this remote here is kind of is very thin and long so instead of having you know you might have it kind of a bit bigger or you know with maybe some some finger molds or something


some finger grips maybe you could even have some buttons like you know on the sides and everything but
yeah
yeah
no
i was still uh i was still working on this uh twenty five euro price point because i think
actually having looked at some of the remotes out there this is quite a low uh price if
if we're maybe i can get to this in my presentation though but um yeah
yep okay
yeah i think even even if it was within budget do a speech reco rec system it might be a bit difficult because if you think if you're watching t v  you're gonna have a lot of this uh background noise from the t v  which might interfere with the
uh participant three
you might have some background noise from the t v  which will make the speech recognition much uh harder so
oh you press a press a button to talk and the the t v  the t v  sound turns off
yeah
yeah
mm yeah

okay so could i describe the mouse maybe be easier to could i use the mouse or
mm thanks
okay
great okay so um while uh researching this this
topic i first of all just thought of a couple of things that i would like to see in a remote and just uh looked to see if they're actually available
in any current remotes and then also searched for which are the top rated uh remote controls on epinions
dot com which is a a you know a a customer um written basically review
site
so um there's a pretty wide range of uh remote controls these days and and uh this remote control on the right here is is one of the more extravagant but it's not really it's by no means uh
mm you know on it's own in being so expensive there are a lot of expensive remote controls out there so
yeah it doe it's well basically all the functions uh are controlled through through the l c d  screen
except for the really really kind of main functions which have a couple of of their own buttons
um and if you look at a lot of the universal remotes out um on the market
i know we're working on television remote but a lot of the universal remotes out there have uh have these l c d 
screens which kind of helps when you're using multiple uh devices i suppose because you can have
multiple kind of functions d different functions on the screen at different times
but um the thing that i find most interesting about this remote control and it's kind of difficult to uh to see in the slide but
it has a scroll wheel on it which is kind of like uh a mouse scroll wheel which i think is it's a really
kind of important design aspect um is it's
'cause the thing is what a what we the presen this presentation we had is what we want the remote control to actually do and obviously the the simplest thing that a remote control does is it just change the change the channel now um
uh the i think that a scroll wheel is actually pretty a pretty handy way of of changing the channel 'cause i know when i
um when i use the remote to change the channel i very rarely use the numbers on the on the pad i usually use the
up and down because most channels are you know two digit numbers and you have to press you know a special
button to enter a two digit number and then two numbers so that's just uh it's annoying so i think a scroll wheel is is quite handy
now um the the scroll wheel is is much more useful if you have an l c d  screen and this brings us to the the point you were mentioning before about the internet uh capability
one possibility if we now we need to still talk about the price point because obviously a lot of this stuff can't be done for twenty five eu uh euro but
one possibility is to download program information into the l c d  screen so that instead of actually saying
i want to i want to go to channel thirty seven because i know this programme's on you know often you don't know what
ch what channel it's on or you don't know what's on if you have a list of of programs on your l c d  screen you just scroll to that
program rather than to a channel
so if you think about it's kind of like a you know in mobile phones now you don't use you don't remember people's phone number you remember their name and you go find that name and ring it so this would be pretty kind of a handy thing to have but um we we really need t to discuss the price
so i mean there are there are uh cheaper this is another multi kinda purpose
remote control where it's it's it's very simple there's only a few buttons but al each of those buttons does
something different in a different context so this is something else we might wanna consider is really kind of limiting the number of
buttons because this is the top rating uh universal remote control on on epinions
it it's really uh maybe worth thinking about limiting the number of buttons as much as as possible um because really i think people want to be able to find the button they're looking for without even looking at the remote control
and was saying before about having different size buttons for different you know frequently used uh tasks but i
think also you know the location and and shape of the buttons is important but also the number of buttons so if
you have too many buttons it it it increases the the difficulty of finding the one you want so
yeah well we w
yeah well we will have a bit of a simpler uh task in that we're only doing uh a television remote
control um i think maybe one option is to have you know a little flip open um door
that uh that you have hidden most of the time but contains the extra buttons like say the number buttons for instance
um
i i would if i had my perfect remote control i'd probably just have no numbers at all on it because
they're just in the way they don't really do anything maybe you know i although i do also find flip open doors a bit of
a pain because sometimes they can break off or or whatever but maybe a door that you can you can permanantly remove or permanantly
have on would be good um but i think definitely you need to to keep
the buttons down to a minimum but not not let that kind of interfere with the functionality of of the device
um
well i guess that depends on how you market it if you if you have the right advertisement showing how how how easy it is and how you can you know navigate to a program without the numbers then people might say that looks pretty easy
so but yep um okay so i think um one of the really
kind of useful things you can do with with internet connectivity would be to have this a programme driven interface rather than the channel number
so if we can have a higher priced uh remote control i think that would really be worth uh something that would be worth
implementing
um mm there's the l c d  screen um which maybe maybe is too expensive um
but i think also at the scroll wheel i haven't mentioned it here the scroll wheel could be used without an l c d  screen just for changing
channel numbers easily i think even that i mean that would be a fairly cheap thing compared to an l c d  screen to implement um
but i think that would be quite useful as well
and the other thing you say we need to we need to keep it just television but i think one maybe one option since
this is supposed to be a kind of a fashionable device is you know there's a certain kind of cool
or wow factor that you can kind of you can have with technology and maybe we wanna make it something that's
extensible to do other tasks say you have like um a little another little kind of base unit
that can also receive signals as well as the television where you can say uh change the lighting in the room
you know that would be something maybe you could sell as an extra so that it doesn't have to be part of the initial development
but you know later on you could you can you know you also selling the potential of the device then you say potentially you can then
do other cool stuff like change the lights i dunno close the windows whatever turn the heating on
and um i think that's something we may need to have as as at least as an optional extra to to kinda make
our product cool since we say we're putting the fashion in electronics

hmm
well one one other thing that that speech recognition could really blow out the price for is uh when
you want to sell into other markets though because i'm not sure exactly where we're gonna sell this but i presume it's not gonna just be english speaking countries
so then you have to s you know you have to train models for
yeah



you know i guess you could actually train the remote control as you're using it by saying you know turn volume up
and you press the uh press the button like uh s people teach sign language to kids f well by
speaking and doing
yeah
actually i'm not so sure because i'm the you know if i was using a remote control to say turn the volume up
because i can't hear it very well i don't really want to you know drown out what people are saying by talking
you know when i'm when i'm instead of pressing up on on a remote control you know if there's some there's some dialogue all of a sudden that i can't
hear i'm trying to actually find out what's being said so maybe speech recognition gets in the way more than it helps

well it depends if it's a remote control th
maybe if the remote control is something that y you don't actually have to pick up anymore that would be a a useful feature of the speech recogntion if you can leave it sitting on the table and you don't actually have to find it then that could be
well it depends though well it depends if we we don't unless we have some input some video input to the t v 
or we have control over the t v  then we can't actually display that like if we if we produce the t v s then
then yeah we can put you know menus up up there but otherwise we need to actually have some kind of something sitting in between
the video signal and the and the t v  to superimpose those those menus so that's an extra
cost
well this is this is another que we still haven't really defined the remote are we still you say we're focusing
on t v  but is it still a kind of like a universal remote in that it's a replacement remote control or is
this something for our own line of of televisions 'cause that really makes a big difference 'cause
even if we have contacts we can't really produce a remote control that can bring up menus on other other companies' t v s
it's just there are too many t v s out there it's it's not really gonna
for twenty five euro i think it's impossible but but i dunno
i think um it would be good to know if there is any leverage in that any leeway in that um
that twenty five euro because for twenty five euro i think all we can really do is provide a very basic remote control and that seems to be
kind of against the philosophy of our company which is you know putting the fashion into electronics so i
would i would like to know if there's any chance of of increasing the uh
of increasing the unit price
yeah
yeah
yeah because yeah
well th
'cause you can have things like the programme name instead of the channel numbers like an interactive programme guide
you can get a lot more information on it
so you could have the name of the programme you could have um the start time you know where it's up to
you could have a l even a little image of you know the c you know the the m the main actors or something so you can quickly just kind of even without reading
well no but there are the electronic programme guides out there they may not have pictures but maybe they do there's dependi it also depends on the country
no but i mean with the internet you have flexibility of where you get your information from so it may be possible that there are people out there providing that uh
well i i think if we're gonna i think we would definitely need the internet connection because even with y i don't think you could even get teletext information from the t v  onto the remote control especially if we don't control the t v  i dunno we need to find that out
mm if it's a really small t v  maybe

well the thing is i think i think the type of peop
i think the type of people that are gonna want to buy a very stylish rem r remote control with lots of new technologies are the kinda people that are gonna have you know a wireless internet connection maybe or a you know
well this is what we need to find out can we can we increase the the price point of this remote control 'cause otherwise we need
it's kind of hard to guarantee that you're gonna

ninety five percent is not good enough though

yep

yep
yeah yep
mm hmm

yeah yeah
yeah they are the most t v  watcher so we should be careful
yep
well maybe it could be a universal design a universal design which is which is good for both the hands yeah
that's right whether it's left hand or right hand but but don't you think that the two points are clashing one thing you are saying design should fit the hand shape and it should not be very small
the first and the third point they are clashing
okay so fitting the hand doesn't mean much then
mm hmm mm hmm
mm hmm mm hmm mm hmm so it means design should be similar to the traditional ones little sleek longer
and it should fit the hand
mm hmm mm hmm mm hmm
mm hm mm hmm mm hmm
no it could be command control kind of thing it requir recognises particular sequence and then it gets activated
means you say you should say like does that remote control being on or be on
kind of thing and then remote control comes in the picture for the speech recognition because this kind of thing
means speech is there from the t v  also so there should be something command controlled you start and then you
stop it's like v i  editor you are having two modes similarly otherwise it's just lying idle

change the channels yeah
mmm hmm mm hmm yeah yeah
but there is one problem then the user has to understand each of that functionality because the same button is doing too many things
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
it does sampling out of the
yep so yeah
so most of the things which we are discussing about is speech recognition uh that means on my own i yeah it should be
two
okay so the working design is uh user i interface could be of two types one is the usual press buttons
which are there so that the user feels that he is knoing doing some he is knowing about
that technology so he is pretty comfortable if he wants to get this and on top of that there there could be
a speech recognition technology also being sitting on the on the remote so
the old kind of users who don't want to have any changes it can
it can be useful for them and the new users as uh our marketing expert was saying they can use the new gizmo which is speech recognition kind of thing
that's right so anyway that didn't come into my mind so th that is a possibility these could be other
kind of interfaces means we can have depending on the cost how much we can afford we can have different kind
of interfaces so spe buttons are something which is very everybody is familiar with so if you go to the
market and you say that buttons are there the people know what it is and on top of that if we are having extra functionality
people are willing to shell that twenty five euros money which we are thinking
otherwise we are just like others in the market so anyway that is the first user interface could be of more
than one type and uh yeah that means we can do the on line changes which which cannot be done now actually
so apart from the speech we can have the scroll kind of thing with the buttons now for buttons normal requirements
like bit coding and all those things are required and for voice limited vocabulary automatic speech recognition system
is required and we require a microphone also to be sitting there on the remote
uh that's right but uh means we have to see how much what kind of microphones and stuff like that
uh yes if it is limited vocabulary usually it's enough
yeah we we can uh target means we can target ninety five percent accuracy or somewhere ninety seven perc
that's right
no it it could be little d yeah it could be
that's right that's right
mm hmm mm hmm
uh it's more like means there are different speech technologies which are existing so d t w  could be kind of which is the easiest so you have to store some templates on the on the
on the chip itself and it's just dynamic time warping where you try to find out what it is instead of having a model which has to be trained and being a micro controller
yeah that's right
yeah so we can
that's right yep
yep
no no components yeah so will you go to the next slide
yeah so this is the design which we are thinking so we are having a power button and the switch
which is not much and then we are having the which is to indicate whether the power is on or not
and then there are two kind of things which can be so one is the button interface which has not been shown because because
of lack of time so we could not put that so now where the a s r  decoder is sitting similarly there
are different kind of interfaces which could be there
so there is a s r  decoder which could be there and then there could be another scroll button scroll scroller and
then there could be buttons and all of them they will just do the decoding and put it in the math put it in the proper message
format and then there is there is the chip which is sitting the green one and it converts it into bit codes and that bit codes
are sent by the infrared device to the receiver
so this is the easiest design the there could be so th an a s r  decoder we can have things in
to have different technologies so this was the my personal preference was that we can have a s r  sitting there on the remote control yeah
yeah but uh as soon as you try to put the microchip kind of thing or something the price will go up so these are the slight problems
because yeah the reason is that if we go into the market means though i don't have much idea but as he the uh marketing expert presentation was
so if we go with just the
mm hmm mm hmm mm hmm mm hmm mm hmm mm hmm
alright
it's not possible it's impossible
are
but just a small thing what kind of market we are targeting is it that we are targeting the replacement remote market
or what so the remote has gone bad and the person wants to buy a new remote or because the cost of l c d 
thing could be as high as the t v  itself that is very important

broke okay okay
okay okay
okay okay
mm hmm
it's it's cheaper as compared to the l c d 
means th yeah twenty five euros is yeah that's right

okay
uh
mm i was thinking of the
mando
mando
a n  yeah d o
it doesn't it doesn't sound cool for me but maybe for a spanish for i for
control
but mm yeah mando sounds
latino
but yeah it uh
yeah because if the product will be international
maybe maybe i should uh start yeah
mm okay
yeah
should be in participant four
yeah yeah

uh
okay so yeah i will i will give a brief outline about what i what i prepared for this meeting
for the functional requirements and especially for the
for the user requirements i prepare a marketing report and we have to find the weaknesses and and the the improvements we could do to the current remote controls
and also i di i did a study with for the incorporation of new technologies it seems that the remote controls have been have remained the same for the last five ten years there is no
no significant difference
between the the b the first new controls and
yeah yeah
well more most of the people think that remote controls are ugly thoroughly
so and they they admit that the the they should uh s they would uh spend more money in a fancier
remote control which is which is good and it's interesting point
also the people are worried about about the r s i  disease which is
if you repeat the sa the same movement which is not a with a not very appropriate
device you you will have problems whe when you will get old
so s people are uh are worried about the the shape of the of the remote control
they are also they get angry very
often because they lost the remote control very often so i think it would be a good point to
to l to to find a a solution to any beep any
alarm or something incorporated to with the remote control every time it it get lost
and also i found that young people the the younger people are the more interested they are in incorporating new technologies in the in the remote control
so in my opinion the
mando this mando shouldn't be very small because the smaller it is the more like the the liklier it is to get lost liklier or more likely likely okay
uh people also complain because they they they all have the same size
of the buttons for buttons who w which are not very use like f uh memorising channels or
or this kind of actions which are not very often but
they they shouldn't they shouldn't have the same importance in the in the uh in the remote cont
in the remote control also the z the design should fit the hand shape so it may be
interesting to to think in a in both prototypes for right and left handed people
yeah
i dunno i th anyway i think it could be int interesting to to release some a a small fraction of of this remote controls sorry
yeah
yeah
sorry
yeah
like uh
yeah like
no no i was thinking of so like something yeah
yeah
yeah yeah it sh it shouldn't it shouldn't be symmetric symmetrical not anymore that's what yeah
and finally the incorporation of a l c d  or a speech recognition system in the remote control could also be interesting but i don't know if the budget
would be large enough
but most of yeah most of the young people to thirty to thirty years old were really interested in this kind of technology
actually this marketing report is restricted to t v  remote controls
yeah but you should be able to activate or disactivate so yeah yeah yeah uh channel fifty
yeah
h i think i think that the tr the transition to this to this new remote control shouldn't be very
very abrupt very hard because w if people see a remo see the
see a remote control without numbers mm they will think it's very difficult to learn very difficult to
very different build very different to the traditional
if y

i'm sure if you can sell a a speech recognition remote control for twenty five euros everyo everyone will s will buy it
i'm sure
yeah but you know the the average frequency of pushing buttons it's about
it's about eighty eighty eighty pushes per hour or something like that

with a good shape for the
yeah
uh
what would be
wha but what would be one question what would be the goal of putting an l c d  in a remote control
what what kind of information
yeah but mo most of the t v s nowadays show the show the
the n
yeah but yeah most of the t v s have teletext nowadays
yeah
so what would what would appear in the in the l c d 
okay
but
yeah
i think that the speech recognition technology would be cheaper the than the l c d 
because with the l c d  you need more requirements you need a internet connection you need m more things but
for the speech recognition you you don't need anything you just say channel fifty and that's it
but then we should move to another target b because at twenty five dollars it's
to move to another target
the expert uh said ninety five percent
hello
hi
yeah
it's too beautiful

a minute please my uh laptop is uh oh there it is thank you
so welcome back
at the functional design meeting um
the plan is uh that uh each one of you so not me but only you uh will
uh present uh the the things you worked on uh the last uh half hour i will
uh take minutes and will put uh the minutes that i have uh at the end of the session in
the shared folder also the minutes of the previous session are also in the
shared folder now so you can read that uh now or afterwards um
uh i had an email from the from the management board uh i don't know if you a al
also uh received it but there were four points uh which uh i think
are very important first one is uh they think that uh teletext teletext
becomes outdated uh and internet will be the the main uh focus uh
second one is also important uh because it's one of the discussion points of the previous session uh
the remote control shou should onl only be used for the television so it uh not gonna it's not gonna be
a multi purpose remote control so uh that's one thing to keep in mind
uh second and i think that's important for the marketing uh expert uh the current uh
customers uh are in the age group group of uh forty years and older but with this uh new remote uh
they uh will uh would like to reach uh a group uh younger than uh forty
uh and uh i think to keep in mind but not really uh for now is that they uh want the the
the slogan and the and the logo uh to uh to be recognised more in the remote so
we have uh forty minutes so i think uh not more than ten minutes uh uh per
presentation uh each and please uh use uh all the the the facilities so that you have
either smartboards the the word files what you uh whatever you want so uh
tim can you start
yeah
mm hmm
but it's strange that the the manage board the management board said that the teletext will be uh outdated by the internet
so that that's strange
yeah okay
yeah
okay
yeah okay
yeah
yeah
yeah that's a cool idea
yeah
thank you tim
janus can you uh
okay thank you janus
you do the last presentation you have plenty of time tim and uh janus don't uh talk to ten minutes so uh take your time
if you take your time too long i will uh eventually uh
warn you

uh you you just said um uh you wanted to to combine more
functions in one so uh you you want to keep it simple but i think that if
you want to do that then you can't escape the the fact that there will be buttons uh which give
s uh more options than one
mm hmm
okay
yeah
mm hmm

so you think it's will be better to have a t kinda total touch screen
jirun
yeah
yeah yeah yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah yeah
okay yeah
yeah
okay but let's not uh go too wide about the those things that's that why we're here it's it's a nice
idea but i think that's we wel later in the stage i've one little question about um a total
touch screen or uh um a p yeah a partial uh
because i think uh elderly people may be uh not used to uh a touch screen so they want the the the normal
functions like teletext volume changing um uh to be uh yeah kinda
traditionals uh and uh the the the the other functions the more difficult functions
uh to be uh maybe on the touch screen but to keep this as uh normal as possible
to keep it accessible
yeah yeah that's true that's true
yeah
yeah that's true yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that's a good point yep
mm hmm
they like the fancy stuff yeah that's true
mm hmm
mm
yeah
okay as you can see uh the minutes from the second meeting this one are uh are done
uh i've uh added the this uh four things from the management board just to keep in mind um
each time i uh i had a sort of uh summary on what you told and uh what you personal
think uh so that can be uh can be read out uh a f a few things i
uh i noticed uh were um
moment ooh
uh th the the main points in uh this uh uh in this
uh meeting is i think uh how uh it's going to look uh with
uh we must keep it simple but have the opportunity to uh have more options
and have them uh hidden or something so they don't uh you don't have a big uh thing full of uh buttons
or uh um and uh the point that uh you uh wanna use one
uh controller uh for uh uh hypothetically each television so you must
uh the the the the functions know like the menus or the the parental control must be all uh by
the done by the remote control and not by the television i think that's the point what uh
we discussed
yeah but you have uh uh an yeah but you have an international market range so you have i think a big range of
yeah
okay
and it's not too complex to do it
yeah
just build it in
yep
okay
we have five minutes to go
yeah
yeah
yeah
n yeah
it's very sensitive

yeah
okay well uh it's almost at the end so we have now a lunch break finally yeah
uh after the lunch break uh it's back to uh individual work once again uh thirty minutes
uh i will put my minutes uh i have updated them so uh s they're updated in the shared folder too
thirty minutes the

failure uh uh the specifi uh specific instructions for the next uh meeting
you will all will receive uh at the uh the the email i don't think i can uh say much
about it so uh uh wait for your email and uh hopefully you get it done uh
in the in the thirty minutes and i w will see you after the lunch break and the thirty minutes yeah
uh well uh thirty minutes
uh yeah
thirty minutes lunch break yeah
oh
forty five uh then would it be uh one o'clock or we we ask our personal coach okay thank you thank you uh that was a very uh good session i think we uh we
uh ye well
yeah because uh all uh things are uh stored in smart board dot uh x d k  and that's in
no
well i can i can uh
you all uh have the the questionnaire again about uh the after work
deskt huh no
project documents yeah
okay thank you
uh well it's it's simply filling oh no it's uh it's also filling out no i'd do it after lunch i think i'm hungry so do it after lunch thank you all
you're welcome
yeah well i bring it to my uh personal room
my executive uh big room with the with the panting


hi
yeah true
mm

mm hmm


okay
yes i can go ahead last presentation okay


well i'm going to give a presentation abut some of the technical functions of these design and uh usability functions
um what's my opinion about what's most important to combine the design technical
possibilities and the user friendliness in one so if you um going to design a remote
that looks good that shouldn't weigh over the uh if it's possible to make of
course but also the user friendliness so tha that's that's some of the main points and
another one is um the use um of many functions will will make
it more difficult so use as as little functions as possible or at least don't display them all
at once on the same remote if you have fifty functions you don't want fifty buttons uh t uh
to be shown at the same time 'cause when you visit an internet uh site you don't want fifty links uh to see but
maybe use a hierarch hierarchy uh structure
and uh well one of the ideas was maybe uh use touch screen but s i don't know in how far that is possible
since we are sticking to uh um infrared and and the remote cannot receive
anything but uh we might uh consider that um well of course
i i hope this is all clear to you if you you can use remote like this with all the functions
many functions but well your thumb is a little bigger than th it than this you have to be very
careful what you push and um if you're looking for teletext you'll be uh searching for half an hour
from uh um yeah well where is it where the hell he here i guess
and yeah when you have to uh use something else so just keep it simple
make clear buttons easy to use for example if you want to use a play and back and stop
that's very important
um well this was because of our last discussion if multiple machines are used create easy switch between the machines but um it's no longer uh applying
well yeah i prefer to use it only for t v 
and um
n uh not to give too many options and and if possible uh the buttons should give a dr direct action not first select
yeah and so that's where the difficulties lie
yeah this so that's the thing you have to weigh against each other do we want to use a few options and might
not be so or original or uh multi purpose as we thought or do we want to
use um many buttons so um weighing those factors

the doesn't
yeah
yeah but when all the questions i had do we want to use uh a menu display on the t v  or um
does have to f everything uh be in remotes 'cause if you use a memory display on the t v  you can simply push
uh a more menu and then select the options you want to have and press okay
uh so that's my recommendation if you use many options in one buttle button um
display the menu on the t v  and don't um use combination of t of two buttons at the same time
or pressing buttons three times for five seconds is too complicated for most users
yeah that will be a problem
yes
so if we have to stick with current technologies and uh
um
well yeah the restrictions of what's uh is on the market today um you should keep it s at this use big clear buttons not too many
so maybe we'll loose a few option uh options but i think i this is more important um
especially the important buttons um if you want to switch channel change your volume uh use teletext
it uh it has to work at once and more advanced options may be put it s somewhere away on the remote behind
uh a little uh little thing or a touch screen
and yeah if you want to uh uh s put on stand by or change the channel that should always
be possible to do not first change menu options or switch something um well yeah as
you already told give some feedback if the user is pushing a button he should know if the television or
n at least remote is reacting and not just that the batteries may be low
and um well my conclusion is uh is uh less is more keep it simple
so uh maybe we should just ease down on the functionality to uh to keep it accessible
on t because you all know if there are a lot of function on the the television some you you'll never
know uh and never use and therefore it's uh important if you want to change
the volume or channel that is always accessible and easy and other functions um that
are not so important um well you we should consider just not using them or at least putting
them somewhere on the remote where they're not in the way for the for the most important functions
maybe that's an option um keep the primary buttons visible uh make a remote that fits easily
in the hands and for some design issues uh well put a logo on it and maybe use it uh
in some aesthetic uh aesthetic form but uh th the important buttons m make
them always accessible and pushable and clear and maybe use a touch screen or if that's uh will
become too difficult just uh
like televi some o older telephones use a l uh maybe it's possible to to flip them open and uh just expand the number of options that are normally visible um
yeah
the extra functions you uh you just see a menu from system functions or teletext functions and you just choose one and then all all the options will become available and you just c s yeah t scroll through them
well um then i'd like to make a proposal
if you make one big touch screen
use the same concept as here keep the buttons always available and use the lower part of the touch screen for the rest
yeah
yes
okay
okay i agree but i think it's very important that they always um make the same buttons accessible so use just for special options a part of the touch screen
and so um an elder designer picks up th the of an elder parents or grandparent
picks up the remote from the little child and who's all in the systems functions you'll have to have the possibility
to turn off the t v  or to switch the channel without um well using all the menu
structures to get back to the primary functions
mm hmm
yeah
yeah wh
is that possible to use or no
well yeah well does it have to depend on the television
well i think that he means that um maybe by some option uh make sure
that um remote control and the t v  match and then after that you can um use some
s insert some passwords as being apparent that the children cannot use this uh change
the settings of the t v  like colour and then volume and uh
mm hmm
oh something like that
well b but make it a separate option in the menu so that it's it's dif dis displayed from uh displayed here so uh parents uh
yeah you can de display it on the on the old style you can display actual buttons on the touch screens
yeah okay
mm hmm
mm hmm
yes
well you can use um when you uh how do you call it s um synchronized
the um remote and the t v  then there's always there are always uh possibilities to change
the colour and the brightness and the volume and um well maybe we can look out if there's options
that the remote um in its memory can see what kinda t v  it is from ah it's a philips this and this and that and
then give the options that are capable the capable from the t
well there are universal d um um remotes and they all have a functionality for all the t v s uh so this wouldn't be a extra feature to incorporate the men menus of these

yeah
yeah well
yeah
mm hmm oh um mo no you can just say uh the c
yeah
in codes y you you get a b a book with codes you look up i have a philips h  fifty five and it says press code four five five and you press code four five five on the uh in the remote and it displays all your uh menu options
memory in the in the remote
yeah well um if you look at the um manuals from universal uh remotes
there are maybe um three four hundreds t v s at maximum if you have all of
them all the old and new t v s summed up so uh i think uh it is possible
yeah
well then you have to buy a new one it's very good for marketing
maybe or an update software update
firmware update you say
yeah
well at uh you can go back to the shop and uh they
yeah ser o and they can download it for you
mm hmm
yeah well already digital information is sent t to the the standards t v  uh
connections you can see what's uh programme is on on the new uh channels so maybe j they we can send
that information along with standard t v  uh
receiving oh yeah
yeah
difficult
yeah
yeah yeah uh s i think some i think it's good idea yeah
yeah yeah
okay let's uh save this in the meanwhile uh
um m for which one are we going my mistake
that one or uh
your vote and your okay
well i was uh doubting about which one to take but uh you've convinced me that uh if you di display buttons about the same as they would look on a normal um remote all elderly people will know what to do
opens up is too difficult or uh
break it i don't get
oh so yeah
yeah
a quarter to one maybe
okay

yeah is it possible to store this on the share documents or what
'kay save it as an image on the res
no and use an image if possible
j  peg
j  peg yeah it's better
yeah
oh yeah it's not connected to the
to our p c s
it's connected
yeah
it gives the na oh
yes
the questionnaire fill in uh we fill out d after lunch or uh
okay
yes
we can leave the p c  on i think yeah and return to the
yeah bring to i gotta bring it home
a big office
yes
hi i see my bunny is still standing no one drawing it uh i figured uh that much
when you mentioned uh improving functions what uh what do you mean by that what what are you think about
uh the funtionability
ah okay so focusing more on the used buttons
yeah
could you use perhaps uh one button for multiple functions like example pressing it in longer makes it switch to an different function for example
thank you
yeah ma perhaps just just an idea
yeah
uh yeah yeah i'll go sure
right uh i'll be uh explaining a bit about uh working design about uh
the project well uh what i did was i dissected uh uh current remote controls and
um i viewed how how they w looked how they worked uh what kind of components are involved
and how they are connected together and uh after that i put up a scheme
about how uh these things are organised and i'll show it to you in in a in a few seconds
and i'll explain a bit about uh how it works and how we could uh build
one and why i think several possibilities uh that we discussed in the earlier meeting falls off
um right uh well what i did was uh i i checked uh remote controls and the uh remote
controls of today are all infrared not like all probably know and the thing about that is um the
remote controls uh have to act as a t v  or uh a stereo or something and those
uh have a transmitter that's also focused on infrared so if we want to uh build uh
mm a remote control uh with bluetooth for instance then uh the t v  should have bluetooth too
in order to communicate so that would mean extra cost for the user and thus uh that's that wouldn't mean
a a cheap uh remote control for us
so that's probably why most controls are still infrared furthermore they all have uh a
a very simple structure so that would probably uh mean lower costs and uh
i that could mean for us a good thing uh 'cause uh well we we should be able to build a
relatively cheap uh a cheap uh remote well uh as i mentioned
ready we have some bluetooth well it may be possible but uh i figured it wouldn't be possible in within
our budget but that's not for me to decide but that's maybe something for marketing to look into f because uh well my
personal opinion is uh is not to do uh bluetooth or or radio waves
although
yeah actually i have t
yeah yeah i actually i figured that would be that would be rather nice but then you'd still have the uh the
infrared function so in in theory you'd actually just move the problem but uh
what i did uh think about was when you mentioned about the uh the cup holder is why not uh introduce
a speech function like where is the remote if somebody says where is the remote then it goes uh beep uh beep beep beep or something i dunno
maybe uh maybe something to look into i dunno uh what the cost that something like that would be but it may be uh may
be something to explore uh i'll i'll just explain a bit of the components uh first you have the
energy source the energy source would be a battery simple uh battery uh that you can find anywhere i figured that would be
best 'cause when the battery uh stops functioning uh we could just uh use you could just go out and buy a new one
so we didn't and we don't have to do all uh to be too complicated about that uh the energy
source is connected to the infrared button but uh the infrared button uh works only
via the chip and the subcomponent to uh the switch there is a switch uh between these
when the switch is pressed in a w on this this case it switches a button when a button is prush pushed in uh a electric current goes
through here and in uh immediately a l a bulb lights up uh displaying to the user that
something has happened that's uh that's so the h user won't be um thinking well uh did the button be pressed w
what happened uh or i press button but nothing's happening on the t v  so is is something wrong or something
so that's just to uh to to explain the of to to uh make it clearer to the user
uh w well the signal goes via chip that's translated into uh electric sig
uh electronic signals and then it's processed and then it's sent to the infrared bulb where it will be uh uh
received on the receiving end and those uh interpreted by the device well in this case the television
uh well my personal preferences here well we have to keep it simple not too many uh gadgets and functions
just like you said uh well the most users n uh you have a lot of buttons and you u u use you don't use them so
why why should we invent uh w spend more time on those
uh i i think we should stick by with infrared transmitting and uh no
receiving so uh no input from the television so i think we shouldn't be uh
spending time on um teletext and st things like that because when you uh
want teletext on uh infrared you'd have to build in a receiver too and so in order to receive the signals
from uh what's on t v  and such so i figure that would be uh spending too much money and time and
yes but what should we uh s i i i f i agree with you but should we spend money or and time on
building a receiver into the uh remote control 'cause that would be i mean extra components extra designs um
larger g uh remote control these all uh all stuff that we have to take in account
so i i my personal opinion is no no no receiver at all um well we should uh look
into the design and the functionability like i said uh use one button for instance for m multiple functions or well
uh just hide the few buttons o of switching it open or something the usual uh stuff
and uh don't overbuild we shouldn't make a big uh remote control for simple functions but
we we should stick to the basics so that was my uh my personal opinion and that
was my uh my presentation uh


yeah but
yeah yeah but
yeah but
well you d you have to keep in mind that uh several t v s uh don't even have a menu
structure or they have a very simple menu structure so you have to keep in mind that not all uh d not
our remote won't be able to work on all televisions and that would be uh a considerable problem
yeah
not embed
yeah but then with something like a touch screen could could make more menu up pop up or something
yeah
yeah

the extra functions
yeah
wouldn't it be better to make just one big touch screen uh one one small uh touch screen uh
applet and uh i'll just make um uh let's say fifteen buttons on it and uh we have
three of those uh actually just uh menus with sub menus with or sub items sub functions

yes
yeah
yeah yeah like like the ipod idea that that we just saw you just have a f a few selected
buttons and uh a few menus and with this idea you could actually make uh several
you can also improve uh later on
uh uh i think that will be great
yeah i wou i would actually go for the
yeah
that is possible that well that actually depends on the television but i think i figure that would be
well y you s you see the fi uh thing is when you buy a remote you you set the
uh channels the the channels are different on each te television they aren't set in a preset order
so uh if you uh lock on a remote uh let's say channel fifteen well channel fifteen on this television
is different than channel fifteen on the other television so that would be uh that would be actually the main concern
yes
yes
yeah

yeah yeah that would b
yeah that

uh i i do
uh i do agree because well it's just not the same when you touch a touch screen or when you touch a button but well we have to look at what's our target uh audience w we are aiming for younger people and they they chose
so that's that's probably uh a
but they
well they uh they all have to be programmed to fit your t v  and that that is bit of a tricky job
i actually use one of those when they are they are kinda kinda troublesome but but the thing is whe when
you uh start uh building something like this you have to build a receiver into the uh
t into the remotes because uh in order for the remote to process something from the t v  like uh
to synchronise and you have to send and receive and that's well
yeah
yes
yeah
oh okay yeah sure uh
yeah yeah yeah
oh yeah yeah sure that would be possible yeah
profiles
yeah
yeah yeah that would be possible yeah sure
no that wouldn't be uh
yeah a few variables
yeah
ah it is it is definitely po
yeah firmware upgrade
that's maybe the cup holder yeah
well not everybody has uh has uh a p c  at home well the most most people have but not not everybody and
yeah
yeah maybe something like service cen or you could well you could s actually look at the place holder you talked about earlier and you could probably uh make a connection to uh an telephone line or a internet connection
yeah
well then then it's be uh back to the building a receiving uh well uh if
it's actually worth it to build it in we could actually look at into it but i dunno it it would be
uh bringing more costs uh with with it and

yeah that would be probably best yeah
like when you when you buy a t v  you just ask well i'll
yeah
yeah that would be best yeah
no no exactly so
yeah my vote goes out to the right

flips open

export maybe not export function
g  yeah j  peg
n oh
to room
i'll just uh saved in my documents
yeah in my own uh in my own messenger
yeah
okay nice
aye cheers


hey guys
too wicked






okay

'kay welcome i have some uh new findings on uh marketing expert level
which i will show you
the method i used was um giving orders to our
usability lab uh to do a questionnaire um one hundred
respondents were involved
and my marketing uh department generated a report with a lot of results
um
these were a couple of findings first page of three um
we have three audiences of two audiences i'm sorry uh the first one this
scale from sixteen to forty five age uh the second
one is from sixty four uh forty six to sixty five um
as you can see here the market share for the first audience is about sixty percent
um sixty five uh second audience audience is uh thirty five percent
mm and some interests from the from the age groups uh it seems like
the young users of remote controls really like the fancy
uh new technology stuff like uh an l c d  screen on the remote control um
speech recognition
i don't think that's uh really appropriate um and when you see uh the audience
the age is going up uh
yeah they don't really want it anymore at least the new technologies
second findings out of the questionnaire um are the opinion
the opinions uh of the audience about current remote controls first point is seventy five percent
of the users find the most repo remote controls very ugly uh and eighty percent
of the users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy
so that's maybe something for the user interface uh designer
okay third findings according to the frequency of use versus importance
investigation um following buttons are most important um
i will tell something about the way this uh this test was yeah
done um persons were asked
uh what the buttons were uh they use most how much an hour
and uh in the second table the importance of those buttons um
when you multiply them you get the these three points switching channels
um yeah
that's pretty uh
pretty normal that's what you do with a remote control um the second teletext
uh and the third uh volume controls um i think it's good uh
that we know what the user want wants uh at least the these three
points have to be uh very clear
yeah okay
yeah okay but uh at the moment uh teletext is
yeah th the best thing you can get uh on t v  like getting information so uh when you ask people what do they use
they use teletext and not the internet on a remote control that's ridiculous
that's a ne i it it's a new technology but it's not incorporated right now
okay my personal preferences um
i think we should aim at the uh audience from sixteen to forty five

mm first of all um it's the biggest share the biggest audience sixty five percent uh second i think you will get the most revenue from i from it um
yeah people from sixteen to forty five watch a lot of t v  more than uh people who are el uh
elder um second point we have to impro improve
the most used functions as i said here switching channels teletext and
volume controls
third point um that came out of the uh of the questionnaire uh people used to uh
get lost off the remote controller so maybe it's an idea for us uh to design ex kind of placeholder uh on side of the yeah of the t v  where you can put the the remote control in
um
that's about it i think yeah
uh not not the r not the functions but uh it came out that a lot of buttons
weren't even used uh on a remote control so you can have a remote control full of buttons
a hundreds hundreds of buttons but if you don't use them yeah it's
yeah they have to be on it j just to t to get it done if necessary but um the most used buttons uh have to be bigger or
yeah perhaps just for the minor functions perhaps
just to get less buttons on the remote control to make it easier and quicker to learn
yeah
'kay that's it
what do you think about uh incorporating bluetooth or a radio uh receiver uh in the place holder next to the t v  connected to the t v 
so it's in the wrong product
yeah
yeah
yeah
um
yeah maybe another problem uh
i think current t v s can even send infrared
huh
mm hmm
yeah
yeah
yeah


hmm

hmm


hmm it's maybe an option uh if you use an l c d  or a touch screen um
that in the middle are the the main keys like displayed on the
uh yeah
yeah this no yeah something like that okay just uh in the middle the general functions like play uh
channel switching and then uh at the top or at the bottom some menus like uh settings or that you can drop down
mm
nah
mm hmm
yeah
yeah
i think so too but and that's partly because um uh a lot
of t v s have different menus and when you have a particular menu uh at your device
uh it could be that don't correspond to the menu what's actually on t v 
yeah
yeah
yeah uh i think the idea uh about uh touch screen
um is very good um
because recently uh i saw news item on t v  um about
uh new telephones uh for elder people um they have like a touch
screen with uh really big pictures on it like uh uh
call uh hang up um
and that's a big ad advantage i think because
one the one hand uh
you make the remote control compatible for elder users just by uh scaling up the pictures or something it's uh
very visual intended
what was i to say more
yeah
yeah okay but but if you pick the the idea the left idea
then what's gonna be displayed on the touch screen
yeah but l like menu functions or
ah okay
yeah i think so
yeah

yeah
yeah
yeah i think so
yeah of course
yeah i had another uh idea about maybe parental control um
like building in uh some kind of pin code uh which allows uh parents to
switch to all channels uh but children uh if children don't don't know the
pin code they can't switch to uh violent uh channels or
th there's just
ju just a simple log in something like that
yeah
yeah
mm hmm
yeah okay
yeah
yeah th that kind of stuff but maybe um if you log in first as a parent um you address the the channels and like uh oh that's channel fifteen that's uh
vi violent channel uh m my ki my kids uh i don't want my kids to watch that then you set the priority to only parents
for example but
yeah okay but but yeah that's just
that's an a an added feature
yeah th th those things are nice
partial
yeah
mm hmm
yeah but but if you display it on l c d  screen with r r really big numbers
that's just as e just as easy
yeah
yeah it's different
yeah age b below forty
and th those young people yeah y you saw it in my marketing report they like the new fancy stuff so
a touch screen like microsoft al already developed something like that for uh uh multi media applications
i th i think we can do that too

done

yeah yeah some of them the menus uh are not identical for all th for all t v s so you have to display it on one uh t v 
yeah but that's not possible
mm hmm mm yeah
add th that that's an opportunity
yeah
but
no
no no no
he he he he me he means just just one other thing uh with the current remote controls the universal ones um you have to press yeah you have to press a code for t v 
yeah
yeah
now we uh just connect uh the t v  type uh to a set of
options in just just in the memory so that if you yeah like profile so that if you
uh touch in like uh one four one zero kind of t v  uh
the memory uh
pops up the options
i th don't think that's uh that takes a lot of storage space or some just varia variables
mm hmm
yeah
but on the other hand on the other hand uh if you have a remote and buy a new t v  that isn't incorporated in the remote
new remote
a firmware upgrade or something but from where
ah
maybe w
no m may no maybe we can incorporate some kind of uh u s b  or a firewire connection so that you can uh connect it to the p c  and download the newest firmware from uh from the internet
yeah like a s kind of service centre
yeah
yeah
i i think it's uh
most cheap or cheapest to just do the updates uh at the service centre or at the shop
it's it's it's not a lot of work just one uh docking station where you put it in press start bling bling updated
yeah you don't buy a t v  every week new teev so
let's vote
my vote too
and your vote
yeah
and also like a clapping uh
li like device that uh pops open
uh too difficult um maybe uh it's easier to break it
yeah th th th that i uh
yeah
like my telephone it's uh it's sensitive too
ah
thirty minutes
how minutes
one question uh how late do we have to get back be back here
thirty minutes lunch break
i thought forty five yeah
yeah okay
yeah
yeah me too
save as
yeah v
but but you can open a from your pr from your laptop yeah maybe save as
no
export
export h t m l 
huh image
paper size a  four uh screen size in this directory
no
yeah it is connected
yeah i think so
oh

thank you
yeah of course
to my exave executive

aye
yeah
okay

hold that
okay
okay mm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm yeah
i think for us it's just like a normal whiteboard but they'll be recording what we write down
mm mm
but for us it's just like a normal whiteboard

mm hmm
i have to draw
m my my favourite animal sorry this is all tangled up here
that's better

mm hmm i'm a very bad drawer
weird
um you're not gonna be able to guess from my drawing i'm a bad drawer okay
they're ears by the way no um close though
okay so like a pet animal
like a cat
no not a cat though
okay so it's not a cat it's a dog yes
it's got a tail then
yeah yeah
so do cats and you guessed cats without a tail
okay
okay there you go so what favourite characteristics uh dogs are always friendly and loyal and fun
a horse
this is why you're the designer and i'm marketing
ah
mm hmm that's it
a blue and black zebra

the very rare blue zebras yes
you got a lot of room here you can probably reach
no
i took a dog
um
a mouse
okay
mm hmm
mm hmm

mm hmm

it's a very big rat or a very small cat
mm 'kay
your turn



ah i don't know what that is it's a bit
it's a bit hard to guess

yeah
mm hmm 
oh it's a shark now

mm
now it's a swordfish

swordfish um maybe
i've never seen one no
mm hmm
mm
mm
mm
yes
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm
yeah
mm
mm
mm
yeah
mm
mm
mm
i'm marketing
yep
mm hmm
anna
mm
mm yeah oth yeah
mm
mm
mm
but we can't really design for something that hasn't been invented yet
mm yeah
yeah
mm
yeah
but
ninety percent of the time ninety nine percent of the time people will be using the main functions the volume the different channels so we can have all the fancy things as well but the main controls need to be very obvious and very easy to use
mm
mm
mm
so try and get t v  manufacturers to
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah
mm hmm
yeah
so we uh we will wait for anna a few minutes
i think it should work like this so i will try to get my presentation running
mm
it's no matter
no problem
ah yes
i don't know just try
on this normal
good doesn't appear on the screen here
oh
okay thank you uh
yes and you can put can clip it uh on your
somewhere
so good morning everyone
um
welcome at uh at the kick off meeting of our uh latest project i hope you all have been uh updated about it
good
so w we will try to structure this uh meeting with an a with an agenda uh as
presented here um after the opening we will tr get acquainted
to each other see what our roles are in this project
so um
we have been provided with uh some uh w technical tools to uh
to communicate and to well learn from each other's plans uh as i can say um so w
we will also try to uh
to get acquainted to this tools so they are also new to me i don't know whether you worked with them before
um then we will come to the uh to the to the actual project plan you all know i hope
how it's about uh the uh new r remote control we are going going to design
uh then we will uh discuss uh well how it should be and uh
wh what uh what our new product should look lite like and uh well then uh after some twenty five minutes i hope uh we can end this meeting
so um basically this is about a uh a new c remote control um
we when you design a new product you of uh you of course want it to be original be
uh we want to be distinguished mm people uh want to uh when they look
at the shelf want to think well that's the product i i need so it needs to be trendy i mean trendy
is what people want so then i w they will buy our product
but then uh it also should work uh user friendly and uh otherwise people uh uh well it will not be uh
be rated very well in consumer uh articles and like that
so the general outline of uh new project will be we first uh go through a functional design phase um
you all get uh um certain task uh in this uh in this phase and uh
then we will meet again and uh discuss this functional design and the same holds for the uh
ph two phases uh after this the conceptual design
and after that a a more detailed design in which the the final project should get its definite shape
alright but first we will do some uh tool training
in all in front of you uh you see uh the uh
notebooks and w uh n note blocks and we have here a
a a a white board
and um well it should work uh i've read it from my uh from some colleague that it should work with some kind of toolbar i didn't find out yet how it work but maybe one of you did so
um
yes do do we have to say something about that i i i'm not fully updated about this shared folder uh
yes well we will then find out ho how it works
um
well this seems to me yes some computer program but i didn't find it yet
so we'll come to that later
so uh now we will try out the white board we have here
so
i would suggest uh
well yes um we uh we should try to t to draw on it and then well it should be smart some way i i'm not really sure how this works but
yes a good idea mael
okay
'kay
you you
d doesn't it work
maybe someo maybe maybe anna maybe you can start then he can maybe find out to get his cord right
so um
l why don't you draw uh your favourite animal on on th on the white board
oh i see uh
yeah
yes mm
so draw it we will try to guess what it is

mm
it's like a cat so i guess it's a cat
what is this now
so that's the cat oh
it's a dog
so but that's also kind of cat isn't it
b bo both predators
so thank you uh d did you uh work out cord
okay
yes yes yes this is yes definitely a horse yes oh very good so
i suppose it
yes
can you can meet them in africa i think yes very good so
ma matthew
so
maybe
i hope you have some space in your uh the horse of uh mael
this looks likes a cat who has been driven over

yes the moustache
that's that's definitely a cat
it's quite you know relaxed situation yes

yes okay
th thank you matthew

yes this is certain uh
some contribution to our project so let's see which animal has not been drawn yet
so you've all drawn land animals so why not draw an animal from the water
mm
yes

so
oh yes why not good idea

why not a swordfish

i hope it still works so
w well this uh this tool seemed to work let's continue to uh to the real stuff
um our project uh finance uh
thing uh when we are and when w you are uh going to design w uh we must keep in mind that the selling price of the product uh will be about twenty five euros so when
designing a project uh i also look at you uh mael keep in mind uh uh uh people uh
want to get the feeling this is a twenty five euro project uh pr um
product
yes okay um more interesting for our company of course p uh
profit aim about fifty million euro so we have to sell
uh quite a lot of this uh um things
uh we will try to uh
to get at a international market uh so um it will be i think mainly europe and uh northern america
maybe some uh asian countries
um also important for you all is um the the product uh production cost must be maximal uh twelve uh twelve euro and fifty cents
yes of course uh um i mean we still have to uh to make a profit huh
you all have to be paid
excuse me
yes indeed
so uh well i think w when we are working on the international market uh in principle it has enough customers uh so when we have a good product we uh we could uh meet this this aim i think
so that about finance
and uh now just let have some discussion about what is a good
remote control and uh well keep in mind this this first point it has to be original it has to
be trendy it has to be user friendly
um maybe someone can mention some additional uh prerequisites for a good remote control
yes well i it should have the the the the expected functionality uh of a remote control
we wer we were thinking television uh
mm hmm
yes yes th th that's very handy i i always miss it and on some remote controls that you can go channel up or down ins instead of retyping the number especially when you have a lot of channels
yes
yes
a and i'm nanne
so
yes
so um
s
s s
are there some other very important things to to do well
to specify in this first phase of of the project so the browse function as you m mentioned
yes yeah
yes
mm well uh i i think
uh w y you two should should i think think this over uh w espec what what functionality
mm hmm
mm mm mm keep k keep in mind i it's a it's a twenty five euro unit so uh uh the the very fancy stuff uh
w we can leave that out i think so twenty five euro you expect a quite well normal but good functioning user friendly remote control
yes but but but ab about the spec the buttons the buttons uh that will be on it i i think we can discuss that in the in the next meeting
uh i would like to get this wrapped up and go to an end of this meeting
so
so you know now the basic the basic things and
well just just for the next meeting um
well uh you wor yes work on a design keep it general i mean so w we will be still fle flexible with maybe adding some functions so
um
you will be working on on
technical function design so
and uh you and you and uh uh uh well think about requirements eh does it need internet or or do do we stay at
basic basic television uh interface
so uh
i think we should now all go work uh uh at this and uh you will be informed via email and other kind of communication
so next meeting will be in uh in thirty minutes uh k keep it in mind
okay
no i don't think so it has to be like that yeah and you have to adjust the length
okay and then
yeah s yeah um
i think you can put anywhere you want actually
i thin
it's not a directional mic anyway
uh
yeah
last
okay
okay
'kay
alt f  five
so yes

total
whitebo
yeah you can start it you know
no they will record through that there's a sensor over there which is going to record the strokes that you make
yeah

yeah
's a cat
yeah
ah you forget about it
yeah uh i think it's fine i just don't want to carry it off
man this wires eh we need a wireless microphone
you know pro specially we should next project we should take l like that
so
oh the dog doesn't have a tail
yeah sure yeah i thought so the dogs have a tail

yeah
it'll still not extend right it's not up to that
it's a horse
ah i think you can put that


i'll tell to get it off my
uh
mm hmm
oh y it's not for that
no
okay yeah
so what should i draw mm
he has already to do cat
so
the cat is going to eat the fish or the rat
ah it's a baby shark it looks to me you know it's going to eat the cat rather than the cat eating the fish no
you should go for the next one it seems to me
twenty four
ah yeah the sale man four million
they have to sell at least four million to make a profit
ah we have to make we have to sell at least four million to make our own profit fifty mill


of course it should have a on off button
yeah s and it depends what application you are using it for you might need uh
we are targ targeting the television set so you need to record the channels you need to browse the browse the channels in upward downward way
uh
and
uh and
marketing
yeah
yeah
sure

oh
i'm matthew you know matth s uh anna and um uh matthew yeah i thi think you know me yeah right yeah
so
so
and uh
you'd need the usual ones like the changing the volume changing the the channel
and then you uh today we have uh um
teletext and all those things tomorrow you might have a some more functions which might come through that so
yeah i p o  or now we are looking for
television things or i p  for example personal video recorder and all those stuffs are coming up
yeah
ah it's it's it's it's coming up actually the personal video recorder and all those things it is coming up
let's let's take
oh in that case you can you always hook up with uh someone who is providing that and you know you you sell their product as well as your product with them you know
yeah no it's okay yeah i understand so we need some numbering buttons some teletext things and then um
yeah
yeah
okay
okay we are alread mm mm
yeah
l
yeah sure
stam
okay
or you get it okay

mm yours is well
yeah but the the mic should not

yeah
mm can't help you with that
okay it's y yeah
right
then press uh al
this you know
oh oh

right well
wow amazing it's working

yeah


under documents in the shared folder okay
yeah i guess we'll have a shared folder uh with documents that we can share and uh yeah
yes
each of us is going
okay shall i start
so i
but it's
actually i think i cannot go with uh
yeah

okay
you're on the knife

mael

yeah i think i will go without without it right


yeah and we should sum up its favourite charas characteristics right
so
uh yeah and i th they like to sleep that's why you said you they are like this
yeah

she has the small legs
yeah
thank you matthew perfect
oh a rat okay
and you
a bird okay in the water
mm
yeah put it colours maybe it would help us
with different pen widths
ah it's a shark yeah

oh
you have some in in australia right yeah i dunno
oh well
yeah
perfect so i dunno if we need to spend time on that actually but uh
yeah exactly yeah
wow
yeah
per remote control yeah per project

so it's half of the selling price if i am good in mathematics
of course
oh you're g very good in mathematics four million
yeah
and uh just before starting the detailed discussion maybe we you are the marketing guy or th so
you are the marketing and you are in the u use user interface uh design so just
yeah i wanted to to be sure and i i'm the the industrial designer okay because
i i don't know you very well actually but yeah okay mael happy to meet you okay
it's very uh
uh so yeah uh just uh on your web page but uh yeah not uh not face to face
so mm
so i
like what like internet on the on t v 
yeah
actually yeah w
of course and first before um designing the func well thinking about the functionalities we
need to know what are the user requirements um then if they need internet then we would
be able to to p to propose something with uh uh t v  over i p  but before
yeah but w w we want to design a new one mm
yeah
the yeah the main is browsing yeah
okay
mm hmm
perfect
yeah just testing
mm
english
break is over
whoo spicy
so he's coming
oh okay
ah she you can look at the final report 'cause i have to record everything we are deciding and such so i'm trying to write it down between everything else
oh

yeah here we go again welcome uh we
have again three presentations and then we have to decide on what concepts the mobile phone has to uh f
the remote control has to support so who wants go
yes
yeah sure doesn't matter
no

mm hmm
yeah yeah sure no
cool
yeah you're just the user interface hmm
yeah layout
yeah okay
you probably opened it
f  five

yeah


yeah okay
calculator's can do it
mm hmm
yeah
uh i think you can only fit one uh source of energy on the
yeah i didn't receive any info uh
yeah
s yeah it's safe
'kay next
uh
okay can we uh
yeah
well the visual representation is not there with speech but you can
yeah just yeah i think you can just uh match the speech commands with the functions that are already present so i don't think you have to design anything else for that
both
yeah
yeah

yeah
that would be the back
back and okay
you did read the minutes i wrote you did read the minutes i wrote
oh okay 'cause i pretty much summed up all the buttons there were so
i hate doing work for nothing
mm hmm
that was it okay uh
again ugh

okay so what we have to decide is what kind of components do we use uh energy source chip
type case type and user interface but i didn't see a clear
distinction between these so i think what we have is okay so we only we already decided that
kinetic would be the choice for energy uh the case would be doubly curved so
rubber material and that's the only thing we have left
oh okay no it's easy
advanced chip okay
too
uh i didn't get any info on this so
yeah
i have total here
yeah i don't know i didn't get any information about that so
yeah
who doesn't uh let's see is there a new thing
yeah the interface maybe can
ooh
no uh do you have a picture of doubly curved case
and could you put that in the group folder of the project folder
ah you didn't draw it yourself ah
arrow yeah
's the target group
yeah sure
yeah
oh okay i see yeah also like this so you can hold it
the children's story yeah i've got it
distinction yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
different
mm hmm
camera
yeah submarine
well
yeah but this this the is for the
okay
uh
ah yeah bright colours
that's singly curved
okay
well we could make a compromise between that but i don't know if it's worth the effort
uh instead of doubly curved we take a single curved
so to appeal a little more to the all the public
mm hmm
yeah
also
yeah that would be an option i don't know what you think
mm hmm
okay
yeah i'd agree
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
different
stands out
or
oh yeah a one hand uh solution
can turn it maybe to switch from buttons to interface hmm if you turn it a little
oh yeah least you can easily see it
if you can uh flip
uh so you have a the the side view
so and you want to be able to
make this
okay so the buttons are on top here and you flip it over that way
yeah
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah right yeah that's good idea
yeah
no not all because you need most of them the arrow buttons but you can hide the okay and the back
uh button and the menu button also because when you flip it open and you can maybe even drop the menu button because maybe if
you flip it open it will auto activate amauto uh uh automatically

why you could just make it mechanical
if you cover it with rubber
mm
yeah so it can bounce
yeah okay so that that may work
okay but then we still have the the the thing of the the the shape
yeah what kind of
harder

maybe can design two versions
mm hmm and ergonomical shape yeah
the female shape yeah with two uh
oh yeah some uh k esk uh yeah
yeah
yeah yeah
yeah so the keywords are primary co colours spongey
yeah
yeah
buttons
okay i think that uh it's a nice design it's cool
yeah
yeah that's
orange or something
mm
yeah

huh cool no it's
yeah it's text
n no you have to exit
you could also make line with uh yeah
mm
yeah
y

yeah and then on top of that
some yellow
banana colour
yeah if you if flashing colour so you can't lose it basically
well i think it's a bit too much but
yeah
yeah
who
and then you can use yellow or semething
why not
aye
like this
colourblind yeah
no so that's mostly red and green i believe
woah
all all buttons
okay
it's difficult
blue
maybe green
yeah you can
mm hmm flashy
mm bzz
red maybe
black
why
yeah so
ooh

uh not yet
yeah within five minutes yeah
y left yeah left and then uh i have to kick you out
yeah yeah
they have leds but they have a colour

you can make them red
yeah but i think you need to keep in mind that the leds are just extra light
uh they they don't determine the colour that much i think
'cause you have to print on them you have a background each number is transparent
uh partly but you have to print on the number or the the sign so you can't
change the colour so
yeah
bit of light
bit of feedback
yeah
yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
okay with
uh
don't mean to discourage you but uh basically
you two are going to work on the smartboard next thirty minutes to design something so
and the
you will do the evaluation
yeah
yeah uh about
yeah i don't know you probably get a mail
yeah once they are finished yeah
yeah but maybe you can do the evaluation you don't have to evaluate yet but you can make a procedure which to follow i don't know
yeah
yeah
about yeah you have the basic idea
and you two uh are going to do this
look and feel and
yeah good luck so i uh make new page and uh be creative
yeah you have uh thirty minutes
then we have to uh see something which we can uh
show to the management
i would yeah
yeah
next
oh and save this uh board
just save it
yeah okay but just press save and uh
it'll be fine
you can also include clip art
so if you'll rather draw in paint or something
then look yeah
yeah you can also include it it's not much work
that's included yeah okay
yeah
sensitive
i dunno maybe just start typing
you also do the other sides not only on the front si uh the top side but also the the side view
uh


jesus what do i write down
why can't i work here this is much easier yeah
mm
no so i just work here a few minutes
five minutes left before the meeting ends

yeah we keep the flip
keep the flip live

no flipping
it's shaking
yeah just light on top
safer
mm yeah okay that the target group
well i just uh ended the meeting you two go design
oh by the way um

i uh thought up a name for our product yeah it's called uh the real remote
with a copyright sign after real
so maybe you can include that somewhere
yeah
i don't see any power cables here so
'kay
good luck


okay

i i've got the same problem as well
oh no yeah no problem
yeah no i i don't mi i don't mind that's
do you want to go first okay yeah

yeah

it's better than than my uh drawing
yeah okay but i have to design the
yeah


yeah
yeah pushbuttons yeah
yeah yeah as an optional uh feature
or combine uh both with a with one uh
okay
and throw it

okay
yeah
yeah one one uh very important thing i was uh yeah thinking about is the speech uh option we were going to use that yeah so um
yeah um yeah that's one thing uh which i'm not sure uh of how to implement it uh into the remote control
no okay but it has to be combined with with the menu uh for functions and
so okay
yeah
okay
but do uh j do we uh do the speech just for the basic options for the simple buttons
for for everything also for the advanced options okay uh we have this very uh
basic uh trendy design everybody says it so that's what's uh
yeah um
yeah in the in the last uh meeting we uh we were yeah putting the the simple and the advanced options separated that's
yeah obvious um yeah pressing the the menu option uh will disable uh all other options on your uh remote control
and only the the l c d  panel will uh light up and then you can only uh change the yeah the options
yeah
um yeah design has to be very attractive but that's your your op your
yeah you have to uh delete this but this is the the the simple
uh layout uh display on the upper side with the the menu button and maybe a some
sort of cancel button or save button i'm
the back
back and okay yeah uh
what
a little bit i think but not not everything w
okay oh i uh didn't read that but
but this is the the basic uh design uh for the for the m yeah for the buttons
um
i wanted to to categorise everything uh with a speech display uh yeah sound
everything you you noted in your uh minutes um every pushbutton has uh has its
own uh led light so you can uh yeah change uh m make it more trendy for for younger
people and uh if there are older people they wanted more uh yeah more uh
luxurous so that's an a also an option
um that was it
yeah
yeah
we're going to produce it in uh china so it's no problem

uh it's it's quite difficult because we we haven't got all the options uh yeah

yeah this is the the menu i was uh looking uh at
yeah
arrow yeah
yeah
s yeah
yeah
but it has also to it it has also to be uh luxurous uh for for yeah rich people
th this looks a little bit like like for only for children so
yeah the colour
yeah okay but the the colours you you can make it uh make the colours with leds uh beneath the the buttons if you press a button and you can disable the the colour leds for for people that don't like it
yeah
yeah
yeah
very cheap uh cheap look
yeah but if you if you make it more curved we we can make more and more options for buttons if you have uh it have it in your hand you you you are not only um yeah you don't need one dimension but you can use other dimensions for pressing the the buttons
yeah
something to shoot at your television
yeah
that's yeah
okay yeah
that's the the more advanced options were uh for the for the menu
but you you want okay you just want to hide them all the oh
yeah yeah yeah
that's but it's it's not
it's not very uh very strong uh yeah if you drop it one time
okay
but when you are left handed that's that's a problem
but that's that's very expensive uh
yeah
we we could make some some rubber uh some rubber uh yeah mouse with which you can change uh and so if you
yeah
okay
some yeah
no no no no
okay
yeah
no the arrow's over here yeah


or blue dark blue or
yeah
yeah but the primary colours w we can uh create with the with the leds on the on the remote control
if you we uh yeah if you make it uh just a yeah bl give it a blue colour then it's just
a neutral colour also for the for the more uh yeah for the people

so that's

so that's blue

mm
yeah
yeah
maybe a
yeah
and which which colour should uh should i give the the display uh
or
yeah yeah
yeah
mm yeah
yeah maybe a maybe a white a white backlight
dark uh letters yeah
yeah
yeah
that's adjustable
yeah or not
that's how we are going to make it uh more trendy
or is it uh too expensive
mm
and it it looks quite cheap that colour i think it's it's not
yeah i dunno
it's it's trendy okay but
mm
yeah
yeah
but the but the buttons have their own leds or not
okay
okay that that's a default uh setting the the red buttons
okay yeah i i was think about a red uh red leds and blue leds and
yeah
yeah
okay
okay
yeah

yeah
but we have to do it at this moment after th this meeting
okay
yeah ah so this is basically the what what we are thinking about
yeah l let's just uh delete all these uh or
oh next

okay uh
yeah
and then after that we can make the user uh inter interface
yeah
yep
oh no it's it's okay
yeah yeah
yeah but this part isn't uh functioning properly
it's a bit uh large
l let's make first the the the all the views the the front view side view and the back view
yeah
the middle has to be very small so you can have it in your hand
yeah the display we yeah we can put a display
yeah
the the arrow functions yeah yeah

no it's it's uh it's okay
you can make it m larger maybe it's easier to to draw uh

yeah that's that's the basic idea yeah
yeah only if you are going to put buttons on the side of the unit
that's the question
yeah
from the
yeah i'm i'm
may maybe it's it's easier to to integrate the the the l c d  screen just into this this bubble
because it do doesn't have to flip then
because we have en enough space for for making a an l c d because here
but why why do we need uh the flipping uh
okay yeah
yeah

yeah
uh the the shape is okay but yeah
i don't see the the yeah why why we should use the the flipping uh mechanism because we
okay yeah it's it's for for for more trendy uh
because we have enough space h here we got uh the basic functions the the arrow uh yeah button
yeah and then h we sh mm


yeah then it's
no flipping or you wanted the flipping so
but if you if you
if you drop it it it just breaks and it has to be very strong because of the yeah kind of
and it's also for the for the children it's yeah for people not sixteen years but there are more
yeah okay that's true
okay yeah
okay wi
yeah

the real remote
i think uh it's the sensors okay
yep
okay that's the side
ah it's it's okay but do we want uh options on the on the side with the with the buttons
or just leave it uh could make an uh a volume button uh scroll volume button
for menu or
yeah no yeah
yeah
mm
yeah you are going to design it so
just kidding
so annoying
i just put it in the in the shared folder so it should be yeah i think so yeah conceptual design what or whatever does it
no no no can you go back one
uh 'cause it has to be powerpoint pre yeah components design that's it
i did get a bit more done than the last time 'cause i knew that i didn't have time so i just copy and paste everything into the
sometimes i have these pop ups or these sounds and there's nothing there and also with i don't know how to use powerpoint so it takes me forever to get something done with it
yeah
thi
mm hmm
who wants to start
sound
yeah yeah uh uh
yeah
and shall i go first so i
yeah
alright
uh components
oh no
yeah true um
alright so i'm dealing with the components design um let's
see i uh used some design examples we had uh from similar products
and i used uh possibilities from our manufacturing department about current
components which will have to be implemented in the design that's why i had to wanted to go first
well they gave me um an idea about what people want we're f mainly focusing on this group
but i want to make the distinction clear uh i could not drag the pictures
into the the slides so s so i don't have examples of how it looks like but it comes
down to what you uh what you think we should do with the spongey and the fruity looking uh type
if you the young dynamic people want soft primary colours uh which looks like fruits
you know you can and shapes that are curved and not uh solid straight lines
anymore so this basically um yeah goes on to what you were
mentioning earlier
there is a lot of um factors involved in choosing the components there's a lot of
options that we have to discuss uh for example the energy source we have four types the
basic battery uh we have a hand dynamo which we yeah we dutch
refer to it as the kneipgatt uh the kinetic provision of energy which means if you move the thing
if you shake it which will be fun for toddlers right if they wanna use the
and uh of course solar cells but i dunno how we would use that into the design of the actual
product so uh my yeah also also in you know
countries where there's n isn't much light like in scandinavia they wouldn't be y able to use it half of the year you know so
that's not cool either
so um for the uh a case there's uh the traditional uncurved flat hard case
single curved which means that it has uh curves in one dimension or the double curved um
i wasn't able to finish my uh personal preferences sheet but well you know that we
will have to go for the double curved 'cause it's daring and different from what we have now
uh the case materials well we have all kinds of hard uh materials like the
the hard plastic the wood and the titanium i would definitely go for rubber 'cause it fits most
in what people wanna see nowadays
um poo this is a lot of text i wasn't able to organise this yet we have
yeah several uh interface designs uh we can use a scroll buttons
for the menus but we already kind of decided to go for the f for the pushbuttons for the
the arrow buttons so that's not really interesting
electronics yeah maybe we wanna decide on what electronics to use the advanced chip i think
is easiest to implement uh for the production 'cause they they can print it better um
yeah i think this is about it yeah i was working on some per personal
preferences i first uh chose for the battery 'cause yeah i'm traditional and that's the most obvious
easiest choice to go to but i really think that we should maybe uh think about the kinetic energy where
you have to move the thing to be able to use it
yeah maybe we
i can imagine that the kinetic uh type energy source would be more expensive to make but it is more longlasting that the people don't have to ever buy batteries again
and it's also more fun yeah i always chuck my uh remote control around so
yeah y exactly you don't have to be scared about bouncing it off the g floor and breaking it or whatever so that's the end of it
uh go ahead
no it means curved in two dimensions so uh w single curved uh let's say would
be a b square box but then with curves on one dimension and double curved would means that
it would have curves curves in every direction like three d  yeah
design
i
and rubber rubber material
yeah we need the the chip on print to be able to support the the screen and uh and f audio function
yeah yeah otherwise you would have a simple chip just for pressing buttons but we need more
i'm just thinking this is not my department but i i'm not sure what this is gonna cost to be able to m
so 'cause we need to sell it for twenty five euro a piece that's gonna be difficult huh
yeah
yeah yeah yeah
child labour man we love it
um let me see wait a sec
yeah i'm going there now
inspiration
well
um yeah maybe it's
maybe it's easier
yeah yeah perfect
maybe it's easier if you guys come over here s see this is the the the standard traditional type
where the form uh yeah serves the function you know it's like really basic but
this m is more appealing to old people and we don't want that
this is what we're looking for and th that means curved in both dire dire uh dimensions not only like
this but it has to be exactly it has to be kind of instead of the
playstation the module it has to be like the the game cube you know where your thumbs would be laying in the instrument
and it has to be nice to hold and
it ha
yeah but that's that's the the problem uh yeah the dilemma actually 'cause we wanna appeal to the to the young public with fancy with flashy colours and with a lot of shape and
yeah and the and the rubber it it will look cheap always you know with the
there is mobile phones in which you can change the colour also of the lights maybe we should consider this
function to customise it and so i mean kids can make it look more flashy with different kinds of colours
and people who want something you know different or more uh design
they can go for one colour like uh for example this uh photo th camera
personally i think it's really ugly
just give me the thing that it's inside there maybe i'm too old for this stuff yeah
so those i think are all my oh
and this is this is with the curved that i mean
yeah yeah
a compromise between what
this this would be uh single curved uh
yeah
yeah exactly exactly
i think the i mean our aim is to make something different right to make something new
i would go for the double curved and i i'm i'm thinking uh you know
uh a drawing palette where you have the shape for your thumb so it kind of
holds nicely something like that well this is really your decision but
yeah as well you can make a trigger button or something like that
yeah or that that is the confirmation button or something that you scroll with your thumb with the arrows and then confirm
that would be a nice way to use it but i mean yeah i'm thinking big already and we need
something that well that that you can able to use in one hand i think
yeah
how about
mm hmm
yeah i understand what you mean
how about we do a uh a pop up screen like the laptop so that the only the simple functions will be visible at first and then if you want
yeah something like that
yeah
no uh like i would draw it like this
let's say this is the side view that you have a a screen that will come up here and can go down that way if you know what i mean so that it would come up like that
yeah or preferably even keep the simple buttons here and then under the screen even you could put more more advanced buttons
f for the l c d  menu right so w w
oh
activate and th the yeah
true true but you can make a yeah you can make a trigger here you know a simple uh with a
yeah exactly
well yeah the the idea of it was is that because you close it you cover the l c d  screen and it won't be vulnerable to scratches or whatever
and
exactly exactly we just have to make sure that the closing mechanism won't break th it's very solid yeah
that actually will offer some extra protection for the
yeah yeah i was thinking if if you have your hand it this is your th
okay if this is your thumb and this is your hand like that
with your uh wrist that you that it would be kind of shape like this you know so it's easier to hold in your hand to y f
uh yeah yeah of course yeah then w then you would have to to make it like this like like you drew here
and maybe th then make this thicker also than the centre give it i would give it a female shape but uh yeah anyway
obviously make it more appealing to guys
i mean
yeah but we have hardware inside which is so it has to have some sort of basic shape
and also the screen you cannot mould it you know kind of thing
yeah
and then you can
you can place the screen here which can come
and but then i w i would
i would do the arrows here kind of thing
those buttons and the simple buttons here so that
i uh y eah that's what i mean the arrows over here and here the s simple uh

or do we wanna make its shape look like a banana or something i dunno
yeah
yeah we could make
we should use
yeah w we need very primary colours like bright red bright yellow
yeah yeah okay yeah
and how about some uh some flashing standby lights like you have on the samsung well i don't like to
call brands phones the you know that 'cause i remember from one of our first meetings that
uh people lose their uh remote controls often
so it not not only in in the colours of the leds that we want something to keep it visible at all times or
um
yeah exactly
yeah
yeah
as long as you loo use uh high contrast between the the background and the foreground colour so that people with uh with

and also for people who are a bit colourblind
but don't we wanna make the background the the bright colo colours so th the total of the thing is very bright like the pictures i showed you guys those things were all like like bright red bright red flashy
yeah something like that something that stands out more
yeah
the green
it's actually a pretty trendy colour at the moment
do you get a pop up if we
alright
no that's actu
red and green are actually the b the easiest to discriminate even for colourblind they will see one of each as grey but if you use uh green on blue those kind of colours will look the same
i think
i think so
you can what we should do i think is is make kind of a see through plastic button with uh one coloured led behind it so that the whole button will shine
as the colour the
and if you think about easy to use buttons we have to well we have to make it the shape so that it's easy to hold f for both hands but also that you can reach the buttons with your thumb if you hold the machine
ah right
so we're gonna work here on this sketchboard alright thanks
alright
thirty minutes
alright
yeah shall we uh make a new uh
yeah i just make a new one alright
huh yeah i'll just i'll just keep it there
yeah
uh sorry
okay current colour so um
shall we make some outline sketches of the basic shape first because i i
yeah 'cause i have to uh focus on the on the basic look and feel design so how it's gonna look and you have
to think uh how we're gonna put the screen in it and those kind of things so if i'm drawing and you think okay i'm
not gonna be able to put a screen in there you have to correct uh do you mind if i draw in black then for
normal sketches
so we kind of want the girlish
figure
i'm not so good at drawing
excuse me
no uh uh
how do we uh uh or insert text


oh that's a bit big yeah

yeah ex exactly
uh
uh i thought for the side view that the w the basic section would be rather uh a bit thicker than the middle where you're holding it with your 'cause your fingers have to fit underneath and
exactly but the uh but the upper side has to be a bit more like that i think
uh don't you think so the display we will put in here the basic uh functions in here where it's most reachable the
the th
exactly
oh this is hard what do don't have to draw it exactly do we
wait let me try it one more time
maybe i've uh it's easier if i draw it in once
okay of course it will become way more ugly

yeah
this'll take forever
it's fun to work with this pen um so larger
and yeah so side
'kay um other views
uh
yeah
let's fill i fill in the buttons later so this is gonna be from the
uh from yeah yeah sorry
yeah
yeah
the the idea is that it has to flip up to here
okay
yeah yeah yeah yeah
true
you can adjust the angle to which it flips so it can also from this angle it can flip all the way up to there you can flip it up to there if you want
think so
yeah because i think it will feel weird if you would make this smaller and this bigger or something that i dunno
i thought it would be cool

it doesn't aim so well
yeah yeah yeah definitely
yeah i guess but uh i mean most votes count right
yeah
yeah true true
yeah yeah if you if you're going for the kinetics
yeah i'm just thinking totally different designs also remember that the weird pocketphone thingy which looked like kind of a gameboy maybe we should try something like that but yeah
oh right
alright
yeah i like it okay this can go
oh yeah we have to f uh include that in our design as well
let's see
what the hell's that
uh
yeah i think we do
yeah or j or also scrolling for the m yeah yeah
i dunno we w kind of wanted to stick with the
yeah i'm just thinking if we i we wanna make something different right so the with the scroll is is more futuristic than the standard arrow buttons
i think
hello
yes i made it
english from now on
drawing or
yeah
ooh it works
spicy
where are are all the other presentations
the conceptual or
ah because i see only my own presentation yeah
this
i'll just put it in there
or not
ah i can't cut and paste it into the other folder but
move to meeting room
yeah
yeah me too
yeah
yes me first again or yeah alright did you open it already or no ah
ah
yes
so welcome to the marketing presentation once again um this time about trendwatching
uh well there has been inv investigation again in the in the remote control market uh it shows a number
of developments uh i will address them uh in a moment um fashion watch
watchers uh have detected the trends for young public because that's our public
um well fruit and vegetables will be will be the most important theme for clothing uh shoes and furniture
and the feel of the material is expected to be spongey so um the developments i will address
them oh yeah well this is the fruit and vegetables looks of fresh bright colours so to give you an idea
um well the developments uh development one uh well
most important aspect for remote control happens to be a fancy look and feel instead of the current uh functional look and feel
um well fancy stands for an original look and feel of the case and the interface
and the second most important aspect is that a remote control should be technological uh
innovative um well it stands for the use of technical features that do not exist
in current remote controls i think we pretty much covered that with our screen and um and speech recognition
so i don't expect that to be a problem
and the third development um is that the remote control should be easy to use um
well the first aspect uh was twice as important as the second aspect w which was
twice as important as the third aspect so um that kind of gets you this ratios so
fancy look and feel uh is the most important uh point of attention
uh so the fruits and vegetables in combination with the spongey material um well technolog technological
innovation we've covered that pretty much i guess um and easy to use i don't think that will be problem
so my point of attention is especially this part that this will be a
crux so that was the marketing uh presentation i had only one document left
so kind of this
so a k a small example kind of this this look uh nothing about the buttons but just sponge kind of thing and and some fruit and colours i dunno just made a quick design
alright

yeah it's okay
f  five

yeah
wi an indoors oh
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
i guess we can only choose one
yeah and it's more fun
yeah just playing with it and especially when the material's rubber it can be done i mean you can't harm it so it's a perfect combination i guess
yeah
so
so double curved is like this this this or
mm
yeah
also in in height yeah okay
yeah with the programme
and and the and the buttons that you need to control it i guess
yeah back and okay

no
rubber material
so that's uh is that is that the advanced chip
wow
yeah
alright kinetic double curved
the cost of making it should be twelve and a half

yeah so it's cheap
um well the interface type supplements
if you go to your homepage or something you should
get your own information
i got my fresh and fyoo fruity uh picture uh also uh over there so
no too less time
yeah also the menu yeah that that w
yeah yeah i was thinking of that also with with a with a uh arrow so that indicates that there's an menu under that menu
so
oh yeah
yeah
mm
yeah cool s underwater uh yeah

yeah
yeah
yeah also a kind of rubber uh
yeah
that should be nice
so s
yeah there's only in in this dimension like this so curvy or not yeah so we keep it singly c single curved then
yeah
yeah
yeah
so from top view it looks kinda like this but from the side you you can have it also in a kind of shape maybe because the the screen is on top you can have
maybe you can c have this kind of shape a little upwards so that the screen is more
towards yourself so you can easily see your screen well well you have it in your hand so it's a kind of an angle from your
eyes to the screen so then you have double double curved in some way so this
this is so the screen is positioned over here
oh something like that and the buttons are more well it's very thick now but
that's uh that's
yeah that that you can press it and then it comes up or
but then the side view can be straight if you have a pop up screen but i dunno if that's too expensive i mean maybe it's too much
oh the advanced buttons right
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
so okay b but you have t you need some button to flip this open
yeah yeah and it says menu and it flips open and then you have the buttons to control it in combination with your
true it uh c it can go open
an adv an adv and it will be covered in some kind of uh thin rubber layer or something like that
yeah uh
it's very no it's very strong yeah
yeah the lower part doesn't work i guess so maybe you should try it over there
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah but but that's optional for later i guess i mean we have to make
yeah we we better so choose one
yeah so okay we should better choose one sh one shape but that's the kind of the idea so it lays good in the hand and then on on the side with with your thumb you you can you can use yeah you can use the button option
spongey
spongey can be reached by means of
yeah and and the and the control thngs in the middle the the the arrows
yeah and then numbers
yeah alright
uh pretty nice design yeah yeah it looks uh pretty fancy
uh bananas wierd shape and other fruits also so it's better to have um some
sort of basic print and then a fruit print in some primary uh colours i don't know what what colours
should the basic print be like like some soft green or something or and then
oh yeah yeah dark blue and then and then very bright uh a yellow banana an orange uh a green apple stuff like that with very uh bright tones i guess so you have something like
yeah
mm that doesn't really work to draw i guess
oh what's this
right
hm
yeah two hours further
thickness oh
oh wh why not go for the twenty
yeah that's what i call painting so that's that's a dark blue basic colour i guess it's pretty nice
and then uh
oh
yeah with some some yellow banana
like

yeah
how do you mean
some some
yeah an orange well alright well this is more like purple i guess but it's should be more real dark blue so the contrast with the with the fruit objects is uh pretty high
so uh yeah that would be a nice uh nice device i guess
i mean the the colour of the background of the display ah well i don't guess it s has to be a sixty uh
sixty six five thousand uh colour so yeah too expensive so just just
a a blue blue backlight or something like that green is too old fashioned but blue
blue's okay j
white backlight and dark
yeah whatever which is visible i know you sh you should test it under uh under a light conditions i mean it's hard to tell uh i dunno
yeah true
which which uh colour should the buttons be
why adjustable
no uh
but maybe i mean they have to they have to have some colour right and if the background is very dark blue
yeah
so more like
doesn't work very well uh more like this colour
and then then yellow and orange and red objects on it or something but then then again which colour should the buttons be
the the press buttons should they be white or black or
uh
yeah but it's pretty fresh on the other side
yeah
my couch is in that colour
yeah
well it works pretty well
and then time was up
uh
that you have five minutes left or
so something like this that should be pretty nice colour but maybe the buttons all buttons in red is maybe a bad contrast for colourblind people because the of the green
yeah
yeah
yeah
okay
so red buttons are okay
how do you mean yeah
no that's that's too busy i guess
you better bet better better keep the led and the button itself in the same colour i guess so just an extra
bit of light and attention
yeah

yeah
alright
of the product which we don't have yet
so wh how should i do that
oh okay or you you or you send it to me or just because you are going to design it on this board right
yeah i i probably get instruction on that how to do that so i make another presentation i guess i kn i know what's gonna happen in in yeah so
i've a basic idea
yeah
yeah alright so that's uh
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
on the left
s so yeah
yeah
this
uh pretty accurate
oh we skip this i guess sound button press
light only button user ca user interaction

yeah
yeah so the pl the plastic plastic buttons also help uh because of um they are only lit during interaction so
well it's a good thing that the buttons aren't um well that they are plastic because then you can light up the light on when when they are usable
maybe you should draw it very large like this
oh right
erase
yeah
much easier yeah
i don't see a sign that the meeting is over yet but
yeah
oh wrong one
alright
but we we
i is it if if this is from the side woah steady because there the screen
goes up like that right so then it's like this or that's not convenient because
then you have the screen like this and look like the it's better to have it somewhat like this
or does it flip all the way
it's better to to have this like this i guess and then flip it like this
yeah so w yeah but we still keep the flipping mechanism


yeah
yeah but maybe yeah but maybe we we should then
yeah there the middle
sh sh shouldn't we integrate it and then like i oh th doh
come on so this is the shape oh it hasn't
okay but the screen is a bit lower because if it falls on the other side it doesn't fall on the screen so there's a layer of rubber on the side so no flipping but just no
throwing and the kinetics oh we better make we better make it like this eventually
yeah
uh they are responsible enough to have a mobile phone so also to to deal with their uh remote uh control yes

yeah
ooh
yeah alright
good
yeah we should work in our own room right or not
yeah yes
see you two in half an hour uh

okay uh door is closed well let's begin
because if we have as much time as the last uh meeting we'll have to hurry up um
well i'll start with the presentation again the agenda
yo
so uh this one i think uh yeah well alright
um well i'll show you the notes it's not as uh interesting as it should be because we just uh had the meeting but i'll show them we'll get your presentations again on the conceptual design um
then we'll have to dec decide about the control the remote control concepts i've put a f uh a file in
the project management folder which says exactly uh what kind of decisions we should take
so this time we exactly know what to decide about and then we'll close again
uh
well these are some examples but we'll talk about them later we'll first look at your uh presentations alright
walter will uh start again this time
yo
'kay

'kay
less

well yeah
l c d  and our uh our fronts
well easy to use uh s is a bit uh contradictionary with the first uh functional is not an issue and then easy to use well we have to choose one of them
yeah
okay
yeah we'll we'll look at uh
'kay


so
well

yeah well
yeah
b
well the the handy thing about our fronts is that we can follow these trends e ev every year th this year it's fruits but next year it's it's something totally different
yes
yep alright

wood is popular aha
yeah yeah yeah
alright nice uh well show us
well maybe it it it is but it doesn't look strong so maybe
but we still have to look at our price of course because uh if we want an l c d  uh window etcetera uh
yeah

yes
sports uh they're uh that uh are accessible on on your l c d  uh window uh huh that's nice
all the results

yeah
yeah
mm hmm nai uh no


it's t terrible alright

hmm
yeah alright
yeah and it's round
well you can make th th th that middle ring can you you can make another colour so uh those kind of things you can you can combine
no it isn't
okay
yes
so if you ti
well
you you maybe you should have uh some some coloured titanium or something so it it looks pretty but it feels strong
no titanium

what do you exactly mean with double curved
double curved
it it mean yeah well okay
well
this soft material thing from uh yeah
alright okay we will take that and then uh mike
okay

oh
that's interesting
okay but you can also say that when you say something it does some function
oh
that's a bit uh
yes i understand but it has no functionality for our remote at all
hmm

so you put a menu in the l c d 
ah
but then we should also have an uh an okay button
just uh there is already a blank yes so yeah


no m next year that's out

yeah

yeah
yes
and what's the menu button
but how did how do you get out of the menu then yeah
maybe i you could j just do an an exit with okay uh
yes well but bec because when you push menu you get in and then you have to push okay when you get to a choice and
well that's also the okay button that's you you should have uh
or you can put in the l c d 's uh window an option get out
exit
well it's just a choice

huh
yeah okay
well okay alright um then let's have a look at the decisions we are going to have to make
i'd i agree
fine
yeah

yes
too big

they're all black
hey that one i like
no
the remote
terrible
it's it's all too much buttons too many buttons that's
well that's too expensive i think
alright yeah
okay
huh
mm no
'kay
no not very strange
it still has t
yes th a a kind of bridge so it f falls over the hand
yeah yeah
yeah
well i have at home a remote with a bridge it's just a half round half half circle at and then it falls exactly over the hand and that's very nice that's it feels comfortable
yeah
yeah alright um where did i put it um conceptual phase i think this is it
i got this from our friends so uh yeah the conceptual design
these are a few examples which we have to decide about all the the materials from the case uh the electric cable that's all your uh your side of the story
um
yeah um now from the user interface your uh package um where no well that's more like the buttons where they have to come and um
b a bit of yeah well a bit of uh design
yes but we have to decide about these now and uh the trend watching so as you said fruity is in well sells good wow uh these things
uh yes um so if we uh go through them

yeah well uh
why should i uh
yeah
so
what what kind of properties should it have well we just listened
you know what
alright
i've uh
titanium back plastic front okay um well i am going to put it in here uh because we
can uh look i um solid feel and trendy
look so material um hard plastic for the front

okay and well the the electrical cable is just normal uh
it's uh from uh our coffee uh

of course
well uh all the all the inside work of our remote is uh standard
work so
the chip is normal silicon uh the buttons are normal etcetera okay so that's just
easy uh we decide about that just by looking at our competitors and our earlier uh
remotes the conceptual specification of the user interface
um well we have our beautiful drawing
well you can put that in uh into the shared folder and then i'll put it in our end report
yes you can
mm yeah you can uh put some uh which button is what okay um the trend watching
included these days and what do we we thing that fruit and bright colours are
yes we can also uh implement um we can also implement fronts from um movies that are very hot uh those kind of things
yeah
launch different lines at once
we should not give them the m the most lovely front
when they buy it for the first time yeah come on we still have to make those fifty million yeah
the most ugly
two
yeah
yeah alright
um well the buttons etcetera we get from mike
uh this fruit and bright colours yeah well i think we'll have to in the next uh half an hour
we'll have to uh s s specify the different uh types we want
to launch when we uh well introduce our remote
yes
yes well i'll have to before i get another warning for five minutes i'm going to get
where is my mouse uh where is my mouse
oh yeah um this is it

well um this we have uh basic stuff interface we have supplements l c d  maybe a a cheap voice recording
well yes alright individual actions
industry designer user interface mike you're going to work together
on a prototype drawing on the smartboard
that's what i got uh to hear
yes well we'll get it to hear that i think but i think so th they're saying smartboard and that's it
this is the smartboard so
um so you can uh you you are going to make a prototype and y well that's includes uh specifying the buttons etcetera
yeah so you'll get it on your em on your laptop um well you will go and do something else uh on the project yeah project evaluation so um
what are you going to do uh i don't know what product evaluation exactly means but uh you'll get uh the specifications
yeah that's why i uh
but uh
how long do we still have
yeah
why does
ah f fuck you
heh

we can't get
ts it doesn't work any more we can't save them so we'll just have them uh standing there
no it's a bit uh bit a pity well we still have uh more than five minutes um
so what are we going to do

i as project manager ha don't have a clue oh we can uh decide how we implement the feeling from our company into the remote
also the slogan on the
we put the fashion in electronics
we put the fashion in electronics
on the top yeah well in in in the right top corner and well you c on the back you can put uh h at the bottom you can put the logo with the
yeah just just small
yeah well
carved into the material
no you you can carve it into the titanium at the back
well management would like it
the front side no no l no slogan
sorry
yes slogan from
company
on the back
with logo and
logo also on
the front but not exchange uh
uh hmm uh when
changing fronts
alright that's decided
five minutes left
so a bit of titanium between
that's a bit oh that that's that's pretty cool
no
yes
i already have uh all kinds of uh
filth between the mobile
yeah round forms
yep

yeah
what
so round where
oh yeah
yes that also sounds uh pretty uh neat
we want it and it's only f twenty five euros come on no that's nothing
the phillips remote uh costs more
well uh you two are going to work together you'll get your uh specifications on your uh laptop and then uh you uh
well i think we can i just it's
yeah o
oh
oh we have a one
so you can uh draw a yeah
well i'll get a i'll get the message
no i think uh well you'll maybe you can uh keep your uh laptop here
or get your mouse because it's little bit uh hard to work with these uh plates
i always have a mouse next to my laptop i hate these
ugh

and in your remote control so we put a touch pad on it and say ha ha yeah we know you'll you'll you'll hate it but
but they do want some gadgets so that's wha what we're doing

well we won't our bosses will be rich
well that's not bad is it
mm
so
oh oh he's totally off again
well
but when i start here
it's here so is it

nope


yeah
let's go
finish the meeting now alright now we know what to do so
um
message no get away
um i i'm not sure maybe you yeah well you'll have to work on this one
yeah
that's a good idea
well
good luck

well something fancy looking can be can be easy to use




bananas
yeah

yeah
soccer fronts mm
hmm
yeah

hmm
and it it doesn't have to be strong also only the feel

oh


yeah yeah

the buttons can be made of an uh a soft material
because people like that
yeah right yeah
yeah
well um nah the method um we will um include the buttons as we discussed uh earlier
um an l c d  s screen will be implemented um we must decide where this meeting
um there are new developments in speech recognition um systems um
and they are already being uh used on uh coffee machines and um well
they're cheap so we could use them now
um it's not really speech recognition it's more um like you can um
talk to the chip uh record the message and record an answer and then once
you uh talk to the remote then um he will a answer with the
the prerecorded message that you left so if i say hi mike and you have recorded uh hi mike back then you will get that
no it doesn't does not do anything but i it's just a yeah it's it's cheap
no but that's the gadget they want or the gimmicks
yes we we should really uh include that one i think um
well as i said uh earlier i think the uh l c d  screen should be uh positioned at the lower end of the remote um the buttons for screen width and general settings and uh and that kind of stuff
um we can also do let that kind of functions um be shown in
the l c d  screen uh instead of uh extra buttons i think
young people and yeah w well every user would like that
um the buttons um should be positioned uh positioned the
same way as they are on a well conventional remote i think for the learnability and uh
well to keep it recognisable a voice recognition can be uh implemented
and uh i drew an example but it did not work quite the well uh the way i wanted it to do hmm well i have the i can draw it again and i know what i did wrong i didn't tick the note bo box in the um
um with the uh the up and down and and well buttons and the
well i will draw what i had drawn on the screen
yes um i shall draw this if it uh works
mm so have i

nah


well these little buttons are a bit difficult to uh draw uh
correct
yeah just uh the numbers

these these will be bigger in the the real design
this must be the okay button used to uh interact with the l c d  screen and with this you can uh yes go to through the menus and that can
um the video button should be uh an apart button because you want it to uh t yeah to use it fast within one uh click
um it's
hmm
this button can also be the menu button we use in the menus well we we can add another button here but
yeah
ah right well you you
no no we we we should uh add uh a extra menu button and this the okay button
ah once you have an extra menu button you don't need that that extra option you have uh redundancy
yeah if we decide to uh to implement that maybe we should
well they that could be anywhere that's very small it could be uh down here
um well not here i yeah i suggest here but that's just a little gap yeah
well the speaker and the microphone i think are the same uh little hole thingy
yeah
well i
um there are a all already being implemented in in coffee machines so they won't be uh very expensive but
this is my suggested design um yes
and oh i think as you can see so the l c d  screen does look better uh at the lower end or at the bottom but
oh um i had some uh examples you can uh
but
i did not like it very much but
well these are
quite obvious very ugly remote um
no well th
yeah well not all
uh this is for children but th
no
w but with the colours i it's a bit the way we're going to
well this is a terrible
um this looks yeah this uh these are the l c d  screens i think we should if it's um possible uh one with colours but
i don't know uh too expensive alright
well nah
ha even more n
well


yeah this is what we've just done right
ah right

not everything
yeah but all these examples are uh of a coffee machine
i think we why don't we um use uh titanium or or a hard yeah some kind of metal for the uh the the whole remote except the front that
just like um most cell phones are
yeah
yeah
no but you you have this yeah
yeah you have the re remote in your hand like this so you feel titanium
yeah
and i don't know if you can make steel just any way you want it to
yeah
well any colour
yeah then you you paint it in the colour you want it the plastic is is the colour you want it
so yeah
mm
yeah
well titanium is neutral
hmm
yeah
well
our customers will use those uh funky uh trendy colours and they don't use uh wood
mm yeah
yeah
the electrical cable uh does
no we don't use an electrical cable yeah inside but this is for the coffee uh machine
yeah but that's not what's meant here i think

yeah
well i got a better one here and i will um
the shared folder
i will work this out uh for the uh next meeting
yeah yeah yeah

yeah
yeah that's the whole idea of the front
yes but that's for later on the fronts y you can do anything with them
yeah right for the uh initiative uh launch
mm
oh yeah yeah yeah
well you can you can give them uh s s three or so so that they can uh experiment with it and that they want more yeah
red red blue and green you give them or something and then you can give them uh other ones

yeah we should do that
mm
yeah we can do that
but bu we stay we stay here or something
ah right and take it to our rooms and uh
ah specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach


yeah um
will we use uh round buttons or square ones for the for the numbers yeah i i i also uh thought yeah
and these uh these s these buttons uh are more uh triangle ish shaped with a square one in the middle yeah yeah
mm
well most of the time uh up and down is programme and left and right are volume i think
yeah it depends but
if you turn up the volume you always see this thingy go up
yeah yeah alright

mm
uh i i'd say only the logo
too much text and it gets too too busy
well it's quite a long phrase
ah the logo should be on the top i think
right corner yes
uh the text yeah uh yeah at the back
well you c well uh yes you can the logo can be on on every uh front
yeah but then you must uh really uh yeah push it in or something

yeah on the backside well n n not not on the front side i think on the back yes you you can yeah push that in so that it is always be there
yeah
yeah i think over here the logo
yes we could
no they have two fronts that you you can yeah yeah yeah
yeah
yeah
no you can you can just and then not a straight line but uh some sort of wave or something this is titanium and this is uh
f front
yeah with the with the curved edge
yeah
yeah tada
yeah
ah
yeah that's nice finishing touch you need
yeah this is the front
this is the
my design
yeah we'll stay here i guess
well we can uh erase an animal i guess uh the fourth one
uh the fourth one is empty isn't it yeah

yeah
yeah i think we have to wait
maybe

yeah
aha this has no function
we've done too much in the previous meetings
yes we've got nothing to do now
its the best remote ever
pinball
yes but you you get really close to the screen with your hand and i don't think that's
hmm

we can better uh draw a design on this
yeah but we can't
well
we'll stay here
or we'll get the email
yeah
well we'll wait a few seconds and then we'll get an email
yeah



mm hmm
alright
mm hmm
mm hmm alright
alright

easy to use i think that's your ta
mm

you yeah yeah yeah you can make a very complicated uh uh remote anyway so ease of use it's not a very comp complicated device
alright

uh you think


mm

mm
alright
yeah among the old people yeah
right i am going to tell you something about the components design
uh again i have uh put up the specification properties this uh so um
uh the different uh components of the of of the device and the materials um
i have heard several things so i uh i'll have to change that on the way
but uh the case uh i suggested uh in the previous meeting hard plastic but uh as you indicated uh it should be strong it should feel strong so maybe plastic is not uh sufficient we should move to uh something
well yeah y hard plastic i is of course uh pretty pretty tough but it doesn't have a really really tough look so
yeah also yeah
mm hmm but we'll return to that uh the buttons of course rubber i think everyone agrees and electrical cables copper is all
pretty basic stuff the chips made of silicon i guess i think that's the best uh way to do it and infra
infrared l led is uh just a simple bulb
then i've uh had a few findings made a few findings uh the target audience product style
um it's uh um generally the case that uh senior and wealthy people above
uh forty five years old uh like as you said uh particularly the traditional materials as such as
wood and materials such as that
they also like straightforward shapes and luxurious style but of course that's not our uh things this so this
is things we must not do and then we have uh young uh and dynamic uh people which is of course our uh
group the people we aim at um under forty five years old uh they like
soft materials uh with primary colours
soft materials is of course uh agai again a bit a contradiction with uh our uh material choice of
what you said that uh it should be hard an and and and and strong looking but they like soft materials uh
so we might uh we have to consider that and
also they like curved round shapes so not uh too formal like like uh the older people want and if uh also a finding but not very ap applicable here that sports and gaming devices such as uh
discmans for jogging and that those kind of devices gaming devices should define the characteristics of the device but uh since we don't have a really a sports or gaming device so we don't really have to consider that
mm
well i also have um
several examples of uh styles so you can get a clear picture of uh what i mean
uh these are the basic uh older older peoples' stuff
it was not very uh interesting uh very classical looking but that's n that's not what we want we have these kind of things
i don't know what exactly they are it looks like well you know uh you recognise the shapes it's very primary colours
uh bright colours and uh round shapes you also uh see uh this device it's not
very round and fruity of course yeah it uh that's true
and uh well round shapes primary colours you can see it all here and of course uh this famous device i think as you know something uh some devices like this so to give you an idea of uh
this has a strong look although it's plastic it's it's grey to to to give it iron look that's uh
yeah well we have to make a
well we can't really make a round uh a round remote control i don't think that's very practical but
but uh it's important to to uh to think about the colour because if we make it grey or or silvery looking
it it does make it a lot more uh does make it looking a lot more stronger 'cause if you look at this it
it doesn't look very very strong becau but this is plastic and and this too but
the feel uh alright well
mm hmm
and i then i have some more findings um uh about the energy energy source of the of the device
uh i uh suggest uh the basic battery i uh got some other um uh uh energy
sources of course but solar energy is not very practical inside a house because you don't have a have a lot of uh sun
and uh kinetic and and and dynamos are are not very practical i think for uh for a simple remote that's a bit oh that's a bit uh
that's a bit uh much and i also suggest uh as a shape uh
a double curved case uh the disadvantage of that that you can use no titanium that that's
the information i received if you use the curved case uh a curved case double curved then you
can't use titanium now uh this uh to give it a more modern look and uh now
the the shape yeah a curved case um yeah i think uh sort
of triangle shaped bottom or something uh a more modern look not plain long box style but
i'll draw it but maybe later and it makes uh it gives it a more u user friendly shape than if you have uh um anyway
um f as uh for the buttons simple push buttons no uh otherwi uh no um difficult scroll things or some uh things like that because it makes more complex and expensive
and uh as we agreed we don't use a speaker or a sensor or um uh speak uh
speech uh controlled device because it makes it also more complex and expensive but we do
use an l c d  screen so we uh we do have to consider uh of we have to use a more advanced chip which is more
complex and expensive but
it's worth the trouble i think because
uh rubber is a soft material i guess uh soft enough so that's uh basically what i want to talk about
oh yeah i understand yeah
yeah
but it it's n nice for young people they like gadgets yeah
if it's cheap yeah

can you draw it now of uh can you draw it now
mm alright
button yeah
i suggest a banana shape
because of the fruity uh fashion
yellow and
yeah alright yeah just a hunch
those are the the cha the channel buttons of course
and then below is the l c d  screen

alright yeah
mm hmm

uh by pe pressing the menu button again by pressing the menu button again you go uh out it's usual the the the d kind of the way it works
yeah yeah
yeah but you can men you can press menu again to get out
no

why would you put it uh then and where is the recording uh the microphone where would you put it
uh huh
microphone yeah
yeah i understand uh but uh we could uh d do but it's perhaps more expensive uh the speaker on the back or something
alright
well yeah yeah yeah
i can live with it
they do they don't look fruity enough
tho yeah those
but it doesn't uh the
yeah ok yeah
but it it must not look too childish of course huh
but it yeah
not not too strange no
exotic yeah we have t yeah yeah i will design it we design it later so we'll get to that later i guess
the specific shape the
our sources
but uh we should decide now
so we have to uh put it in one uh document
copy paste uh this story into a into a word document and then uh put the answers after the subjects yeah
well we have to decide all these things
w we can uh override them
well a case uh that's me uh i suggest well what do i suggest actually
uh s solid yeah yeah
yeah i understand yeah so we have titanium
yeah but the non removable elements of the of the remote so not the front could be titanium to give that uh strong look and then the front is made of plastic and you can put that on and off and switch it
no but you have titanium of course uh you have the best of both worlds
and of course yeah you have the the the plastic front end but you also have the titanium
yeah of course but yeah you have to make a
decision
i guess so uh titanium i sh i think uh
huh well well the
according to my sources uh it's it's totally possible to make an entire uh uh uh titanium is available and uh we can uh make uh an entire remote out of it if we want
mm
mm
yeah i think that's a nice trade off
alright
yeah for the front and then titanium for the back
for the non removable uh part
well but
the titan titanium isn't isn't v very yeah i it doesn't uh curves
no uh i nei titanium is very no no no but you know b titanium is very basic colour and it doesn't really
matter if we have a purple front on it or a orange front i dunno if if you disagree but i think it's doesn't
matter very much
and even if it does uh doesn't match it will uh people like mm colours that don't match
cop copper uh material
excuse me

yeah copper i just a ba basic uh
yeah in
yeah well inside the remote control we use a couple of uh

oh external well a coffee grind doesn't have na ja never mind the coffee grind
right

alright mm hmm
yeah the the the front w
mm hmm
yeah yeah
for the for the launch yeah
so e th then a c couple of basic colours not not very uh sim not
yeah
yeah
very boring yeah the most boring fronts possible
yeah but you you can have some basic colours and then we come with the special patterns on them and and uh and uh
uh we still have to make we have still have to make the es the the real basic design because yeah we have the sketch but

alright yeah

the price
we all agree on that yeah
together or uh yeah together how yeah yeah but how do i

some
some non functional tasks
you're fired no but
well can we talk about something else uh
uh no i don't know anything but maybe uh anyone else uh yeah
round i think
to make it as uh as round as possible
but now i see the
well th th th th th that depends uh
well we uh
we we j we'll just give them an uh we'll design it and then they can give comments on it

well yeah um i think um a logo our company logo and the slogan should be or could be yeah why not if there's enough space you can put uh we'll we'll
well our slogan is not very long it's just a simple what is it
you c
but you can put it on the back on the titanium part the logo and the and the
yeah they do well yeah
right corner or maybe here in the middle
yeah it it should be hard on the on the on the board and you can remove the front
i l i like the idea of the of the slogan on the on the on the thing but am i the only one or uh
no not on the front but on the backside uh
i think it's a nice idea to make it more recognisable that the next to the logo you have the slogan
to make more uh of an impression
not too big no very small not on the entire back but uh just very small but readable enough of course
but we'll uh we'll take that uh with us into the design
lo uh yeah or maybe here in the middle but we'll decide later
do you do you see a bit of the of the um
of the uh titanium o on the front uh maybe if we make this this this lower part titanium the front is the the upper part and the the bit with the with the l c d  screen so
yeah no no betwe of between we can do but but then you have two parts of front two fronts that
this enti entire bottom

and then the lower part is titanium
i think that's nice yeah
yeah
i like that bit of uh titanium also on the uh
a bit like uh a bit like your mobile phone maybe you can show it it also has the those two distinct uh
mm bit like this uh it's uh
yeah yeah that uh yeah maybe a nice touch yeah

i think i'm going to buy it
that's a bit too much but no no no no but i think uh this looks uh pretty nice actually of course because it's my design but no our d our design alright
but don't erase my cat
i want to preserve it

what are you doing chief
yeah until the until the beep goes but i don't uh do we have to stay here or i think we have to return first
the high powers from above will have to tell us yeah
yeah touch pads yeah
we can uh do a touch pad on our remote no just kidding well we have uh b you have to have a bit of humour in the in the discussions too because it becomes too too too too stressy


but uh th youth doesn't care about functio functionality so
yeah
bless you
mm
too much
well they uh
i think that's good we all had uh our talk and
we agree i guess on uh several thing on most uh on things
yeah you have to push harder
mm


where's the good old chalk board with the
the green board with the how do you call it chalk yeah
yeah maybe
maybe if i if that thing is recalibrated we can draw a thing quick and then before it uh
goes off again
maybe w maybe we maybe w m can we get email here huh yeah guess so
a happy hol happy holidays
i'm listening
right
great


alright great
yeah great
alright trendwatch

right
i will speak about uh latest trends trends latest fashion updates and uh things we must not do
uh the trends it's very important that uh the control is fancy looking and
good uh feeling
uh this because of our last model was very functional but it uh people didn't
like that so our new mo model must be very good looking that's uh something you
uh have to take a look at and uh the feeling has to be very great also the menus and things like that they
have to they have to feel great
um there's a minus uh two times here because this is the most important point this is uh
two times as less important and uh same for this one um technological
technological innovations that's uh regarded very highly too
uh such as an uh l c d  screen uh speech uh acknowledgement as we uh talked about earlier so we have to have uh something like that like we uh
right uh the last point is easy to use well i think that uh speaks for s for itself i don't know who's uh who's going to look at that yeah
yeah i know
i think we have to go for the first one it's the most important one so we have to uh take that one
so it it it isn't very important that that it works easy but it has to look great
we'll see
yeah right
but the most important thing is that it looks great and people say wow that's real great uh great concept alright uh these are the new colours of this year so it must be very bright very colourful people like this
so we we have to think uh in this direction so i set your mind to it findings fashion update fruit and vegetables are cool i am told
the group we are targeting is uh very pleased with fruit and vegetables so we we
we might cons consider in front of uh in in that sort of uh way uh
furthermore uh material that's your part should be very strong i was thinking of something like uh
well uh iron plate over it maybe in a colour or something that looks so f really flashy but it it is
also strong and that's uh also for the younger public
yeah that's great but i think we can all make the the fronts of titanium or something uh really thin so it looks very heavy but you can still uh use it very easily
well the don'ts older people like dark colours and simple shapes well we don't want uh older
people we want young people so uh we're gonna turn that around we're gonna have real uh
cool shapes and lots of colours right okay
we don't want wood
old people so that's it for me
yeah we should change that
no no no

mm yeah

we keep coming back to the fronts
yeah
fruity fruity
well it's got a strong look this yeah
yeah it still has a strong look
but then you are losing your fruity colours
that's true
yeah but the
but it doesn't have to look strong the the results are the feel of the material is expected to be strongy the feel
nah yeah the feel
right
i agree


i dunno


yeah right

yeah right

oh okay

right
no
but that that makes it cheap it's it's just a an extra function and it's cheap
no but
yeah right young people love them
yeah ple
right

alright how how
how do you uh uh give input to the menu on the l c d  screen
alright so you have a menu button and then you can go up and down
yeah right
yeah

you have to push hard


yeah
yeah

you've
right
and you you need a you need a speaker
for the
yeah yeah
exit
but we need a we need a a recording recording button for the speech uh part or don't
right and spea speaker at the back or something
alright
alright
yeah fine move on

yeah
nei they're n they're not trendy
it doesn't look strong
yeah right
this is just crazy
nah th it's too expensive yeah
but are we going for a strange uh form
'cause people like that
not too strange you can make the the underside you can make it more round where the l c d  is
i dunno if you know the no nokia telephone with uh the round uh thing at at the bottoms s something like that
you know
yeah but people like something uh new you know yeah different y yis
alright great
your bag
yeah materials are the most most impor
yeah


do you know the new uh
no no
the front is the most important
but the feel of plastic isn't strong
yeah alright alright 'kay
yeah fronts are are cheaper than when they're from plas
yeah but it it's expensive
bendable bendable
yeah
paint spray
yeah alright
so we're going for a titanium back and a plastic front
yeah great
yeah
but then you have the problem when you have a titanium back you can't switch it when you want an other colour on the front it doesn't match you know
i understand yeah yeah yeah yeah
alright
yeah alright
funky customers alright

nei
so external
yeah



alright

i think we can launch a couple of packages you can buy a different kind of of of machine but it's the same thing but with another front so
and you can you can
yeah right
yeah but if you if you launch uh five different packages like ipod mini
yeah
it's good marketing
yeah n not too heavy you can always take another pick
they have to buy it later on yeah right more basic yeah
yeah right
yeah
yeah but we we must remember that fancy look and feel is the most important thing else it w won't sell so
lost my mouse
unbelievable
yeah
yeah togeth
you can take the smartboard
have fun 'kay
we don't have produ product yet so kind of difficult

ajax nah
um round yeah round
curvy yeah so you can see you have to up or down
and this must be uh volume i think and this programme
yeah
yeah that's right
yeah okay
yeah i noticed
you can't uh click the corners
it's a real real great thing
let's start the design
o
yeah me too
but we kree we keep adjusting to the fashion
with our fronts so
yeah right
the logo
yeah
but the logo the logo shouldn't be exchangeable when you get off the front
yeah yeah
yeah but you can scratch it off or something it's better if you have it uh
yeah
i agree
but not too big
just uh yeah

okay
yeah
no no no no you have to make this titanium too
else you you get problems with the l c d  like dust in it and so things like that when you exchange all the fronts and it's open
yeah some some kind of wei weight in it yeah
yeah

yeah you can make it go
round this corner too where the logo is because it has to be uh there all the time you know
so uh a little corner of titanium
so this this is the exchangeable part

right
taking all the credit
but there's a problem we can't uh take a blank one or can we
yeah nah that's alright that's alright


this one is empty
you have to empty one huh

alright
no

yeah
yeah it's not relaxing
i i don't have a laptop
yeah right dream on
half
no
it's all about cool things
and it will sell
we will be rich
no

no man you just have to push harder
yeah
mm
recalibrate it
yeah
finish meeting now
yeah oh


alright have fun lads

's to do now is to decide how to fulfil what your stuff is so in that sense so it does kind of make sense yeah
yep
yep
yep
mm hmm
no
yep
mm hmm
yep


it's probably not sending
yeah
yep there it is
and the play doh 's yellow
cool
mm hmm
mm 'kay um
oops
yeah okay let me just get this going first
ah there it is

'kay that should be it
okay um i guess the same thing again i started with something very basic so just so you
guys have some idea of what's involved in my process um and then you can just work through it and we 'll either modify it or
start from scratch um depending on what your needs are
um the components are exactly the same um i think like what you guys said um the most input that's needed
is basically in the user interface the rest of the components um they do have an impact in terms of cost
and complexity um like you said time to market was a problem um and how many components are physically in there in cost
and the power is basically a factor of that um and the lower components the power the logic the transmitter and the infrared
um they affect you in terms of the size of your device um and that would have some inte
impact on how y i think more how you hold rather than um the actual use using the
the remote control because um like we've said we've defined like we only want the basic things that to be visible and the rest of them we try to hide
so um you know it's just a matter of working out space so i guess three things um cost
um complexity and the size these are the three things that um will have an impact on you so just go through it in the components
um these are the options that are available to you um i'm not very sure about the voice thing 'cause i got another email
and it was in fact quite sketchy on what n the voice options are
um it said it could talk to you but it never said anything about being able to listen i it said something about a sensor but never clarified that
so maybe if you well i could see the other email that they sent you um 'cause they got back to me with like
different requirements or different offerings of what components availa
okay so your basic components are buttons okay and you have a wheel available like a mouse scroll wheel okay there's an l c d  display um i think these are quite standard things
no um they're well in the sense that these are all the options available for you i'll explain to you the complexity and the cost thing again
a bit later okay um then there's um how the case actually looks it can actually be flat
or it can be curved um and then the different types of materials that you can use um i don't think you can use them
in a combination
um but um i could check back for you but i don't think you can actually use them in a combination
um i think plastic and rubber would be fine but plastic rubber and wood i wasn't i'm not very sure about the titanium
they had some restrictions on using the rubber and the titanium um the rubber was a restriction on the kind of power source
you could use but the titanium had a different kind of things on the shape of the thing so i think that there
is some restriction on um
i think you could probably group plastic and rubber together wood and titanium but you know it might be easier
from a cost perspective and a complexity just to use one you know as opposed to two um and the other components
are logic chips um again i'll i'll go back to the component chips the com how complex
or how easy the logic is it depends on how many functions you have on the on the unit
um and that impacts cost um i don't think the logic chip has a issue about size 'cause they should be about the same size power
consumption should be about the same um i think the main impact is complexity um
and the other thing is um the power options um the first one is a standard battery okay the second one i think
is more of a gimmick then actually a useable thing it's a wind up
you know a crank yeah but that that might be something i think that's
more of a look and feel decision because i don't think you can have one power source if you're using the alternative power sources
i think whatever it is you still need a battery 'cause i don't think anybody wants to keep doing one thing okay the other ones are a solar powered cell which may not be a great idea in europe or any country that has seasons 'cause half the year you'd be dead
so like what i said you probably need like a battery and something else um and the kinetic one i guess
for me is the most interesting one because it's movement and people like to fiddle with their and it's a nice sales gimmick i think
from a marketing gimmick it it's a technology thing it's a shake it it doesn't work shake it knock it or something
you know you know you have you had those balls you know those stress balls where you bounce the ball and it and
it lights up and it goes you know that might be a gimmick combined with rubber
you know just to if you get frustrated wi remote control you can throw it kind of you know just uh you know
um so um okay my from my role i don't think that personal
preferences but role preferences i think um something comfortable to hold um small
and slim i guess that's more in the sense of small and slim in terms of comfortable not so small you can't
you know like a phone or something too small phone
um and the other thing is from a production point of view um the less components we use and the simpler the components means
you reduce your cost and you increase your profit um and also the time to market and the complexity
of developing designing and debugging it um so um okay let me just go back and talk
about some of the restrictions um
the user interface restrictions basically means that if you use more complicated features like the buttons are standard okay
the l c d  panel and the scroll wheel you need more complicated logic um the case okay
with a rubber case you can't have the solar panels okay with the titanium case let me just check
that um
titanium case can't be curved it has to be square
okay um there's no restriction on the plastic and it can't be curved on the wood so that's again i don't
think you can use them in a combination um especially the titanium i i suspect they're very fixed to a particular
need so um mixing them may not be a good idea um yep that's it
um i think we could because the l c d  panel requires power and the l c d  is a form of a light so that
are you thinking are you thinking of of a light in the sense of um a light light or a light in the sense of it glows kind of you know frankenstein it's alive
okay
okay
okay
um that's why i think the option of the the kinetic thing which basically means as long as you shake it like a watch like an automatic watch
um it's probably sensitive enough when you fiddle it so you could trigger that to a light like i said the bouncing ball thing or you could trigger that to use that to power the light as opposed to so when they pick it up right and then that that sorta triggers the
glowingness
i think he made that
is there a particular shape that you're interested in like does marketing have any research on does it need to be long does it need with a square thing wha
yeah 'cause that will n help narrow down the choice of
like fruit i'm thinking fruits in my head but that's tacky
do we need an l c d  display what what's the functionality of that
yeah but the question is what are we using it what would we what would we achieve from it putting in lights is cheap but putting in an l c d  panel just to make it glow is a bit of a
mm hmm
i think that will be a problem because we don't have an input device to get the listings into it so um it's a bit nuts to get the monday tuesday wednesday you know
um i i'm not saying there's no need for an l c d  display but um it's what's what what would it tell the user 'cause the l c d 
tends to be an output as uh as opposed to an input so um does the remote control need to
talk back to the user we have the option of the speaker as well the sa the same thing goes for the speaker is there a need for
the remote control to to talk back
um
you could put a game on it when the t v  dies you can play with the remote control
where would you physically position the buttons um i think that that has some impact on on on many things um maybe you wanna draw onto the
yep
no like i said we have a h hybrid kind of thing so it's not gonna charge the battery it's just
yeah
yep
yes yes
or even a clear case um you know a a glowing a a glowing yellow type
case where the yellow is showable but in the dark it sort of it's alive
um in in a slight subtle way
yeah yeah
yeah
or or there might be a light running through it like a mouse you know you have cordless mice and they don't eat that much power right so the power the battery in that sense maybe you have one or two stratig strategically placed lights that sort of
yeah but because the case is transparent so it gives it a little bit of a glow doesn't make it freaky
the question is when you're rolling it how do you wanna roll it do you want 'em to roll it like that do you want 'em to roll it like that 'cause in a mouse your hand's in a position to roll it whereas the other thing about having it jog dial this way it tends to get moved accidentally
that's a very unnatural motion to yeah can you imagine you have to scroll a lot um
it might work for volume and maybe some of the brightness controls and stuff like that but not for channels right
if you have a telewest box you've got like you don't have to buy all the channels you've about fifty channels can you imagine trying to
um and i don't think having that you know too quick too slow kin it's confusing to the i dunno
but users tend to tend to want to use that and once they lose out on the user experience they're like
because that's becomes the most accessible thing in front of
yeah
so you wanna expand the shape of the
that that might have one problem in terms of um in terms of whether you're left handed or you're right handed you might be locking yourself in could i just could i just jump in and suggest something quickly
um i think one thing would be the jog dial 'cause that's gonna have quite a big impact on the thing um
yeah that's what i was thinking the a slide because then you you don't have to put the hand i think incorporating a logo is quite straight forward there's lots of space for it um
yeah but it's also a a marketing and a function
yeah
feel like fruit fruits kids
no like
yeah yeah
yeah yeah kinda like that yeah
play doh time
you got to choose first no we're kidding
okay can i just swipe your power cable i don't think it matters
okay lemme okay i'm gonna pull everybody out first and then put in whoever needs to be left
it's you
argh this is a real hassle and a oops
i'm gonna take the microphones 'cause it's too lazy t take them off again
cool
okay
okay well
okay
okay we all ready to go well how um on the in this meeting then if we um
i'll just just recap on the minutes from the last meeting and we uh decided on
decided on our our target group being fifteen to thirty five and we decided that it was gonna be
non rechargeable battery powered that we're gonna group our audio visual and other functions into into
those categories um and i told you guys about the three new requirements
about ignoring teletext ignoring everything except the t v  and trying to incorporate the the uh
corporate colour and slogan
um so that was the last meeting is there anything have i forgotten anything
is that everything okay um so if we have the three presentations and then if you have anything to kind
of that you know you're gonna want to discuss maybe just make a note of it and we'll have all the discussion at the end that might be a better idea
this time and so if we start off uh with andrew and then craig and then david
if that's alright um and then after that we'll have to make some decisions about stuff
right so if you wanna take this

screwed in quite tightly
uh what did uh how did we leave it with speech recognition now we did we say we were gonna try maybe incorporate it but we
hadn't made a definite decision on that right oh i should also point out that um the you know the kind
of final objective of this meeting is to reach a decision on the concepts of the product so
um that's kind of the end result hopefully
uh huh
hopefully appear in a wee second
up there we go
oh no
oh right
here we go
okay
mm hmm
aye a fair point definitely
okay

aye right
uh huh
okay

okay okay

mm hmm
mm that's true yeah
mm 'kay
great
okay
yeah
ah
okay
that's great
uh huh
okay great um thank you for that uh craig do you wanna
uh plug yours in then
mm
not quite
oh something coming now yeah
there we go
mm
mm hmm
mm hmm
okay
i think it's yellow because like the website is yellow and there's a band at the bottom is yellow so yellow lemon you know definitely food for thought there but keep going and we'll discuss it after
mm hmm
mm 'kay
mm
aye that's a good idea yeah
yeah
okay
okay
yeah that that was very good and uh now with david
i know it'd be handy wouldn't it
do y do you wanna sit in the the line of sight of this um
yeah

mm hmm
hmm
mm
mm hmm
we you couldn't have like plastic and rubber
yeah
mm 'kay
okay
mm hmm

i'll clear one of these things for you
just by moving it yeah
mm
mm hmm
mm
w yeah uh yeah yeah i see

yeah
i know what you mean yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm
okay
okay
right
okay
right can i
yeah well yeah it's just i'm quite keen to get the discussion going with the time we've left so but yeah you c ask away
mm
why what kind of light do you want are you thinking of
uh huh
yeah
yeah yeah yeah
like a phone yeah like the backlight in a phone okay cool
yeah
mm
mm
okay
okay
right okay um well let's just go right back to the
marketing ideas for a start and just giving an id idea on the time we've got about fifteen minutes to play with at most
so um yeah so just t to bear in mind that the ultimate goal of this meeting
is to reach an decision on the the the concepts of the product
so back to your idea about um incorporating the idea of like fruit and veg and the corporate colour and things like that um i mean what does everybody think about
does anybody have any ideas of about how we can fit all that in together i mean that's kind of the user interface type of thing what are your thoughts on that
so maybe do y are we thinking something that like s could sit in your hand comfortably or do you th you'd hold onto comfortably or
so something quite curvy okay um right okay colour wise i mean you made a re uh was it you or uh i can't remember who made the point about how if you've a nice bright colour you'll not lose it was that
whose about how if you have a bright colour you'll not lose it so much um and when the corporate colour is yellow i mean maybe we could think about about the colour of the whole product being yellow i don't know um
and then obviously the uh the materials when it has anybody got like an overall picture in their mind about what what might work
that's all
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
okay
right
oh you know like in circular in shape or
choice of material yeah 'cause i i i was kinda thinking about as well you know how you get these shock resistant
mobile phones and they're plastic but then also have like rubber on the outside and it kinda feels it feels kind of
warmer to the touch it feels a bit more comfortable and maybe we could incorporate plastic and rubber
into it and then then we could have curved shapes 'cause wood or titanium yeah it's gonna have to be boxy and rectangular and i think we might be moving away from that you know so um
well i'm do we really want it in like the shape of a lemon or no i don't think we do either
okay right well um so thoughts about the actual shape of the thing
a snowman shape
uh huh
that's quite a distinctive shape that would be good wouldn't it
yeah so yeah should we go with that
do you wanna draw it on the board
ooh that'd be good
mm hmm
so call it the snowman shape trademark
yeah that's cool um and i mean colour wise what does everybody think i think it is quite important to get yellow in there somewhere i mean do you want the whole thing yellow maybe like yellow and white do you want something
uh huh
okay cool um and also i mean how are we going to incorporate the slogan in the fact that it talks
to you i mean it might be quite cool if when you first start using it it says what is it putting fashion
into electronics or something i dunno or when you like or if you turn it off or something if it can speak if
it could actually say the slogan it might be a bit more powerful than just having it written on it somewhere i d i d any thoughts on that
at all
i know um unless an a i mean if you also would that work if we wanted to incorporate um an l c d  display where would we put that would we put that on the inside or
it's bound to increase the cost of it a lot i would've thought
yeah
mm oh yeah that's true
yeah
so so no need for an l c d  display
i think that would make it very complex
yeah
yeah
i don't know if there is really no um
i would say no need for a talk back uh does anybody disagree with that
no easy
okay um right so you're gonna have the three different sets of of functionalities um i mean do you wanna group them into s head of the snowman body of the snowman inside of the snowman is that what you're thinking
okay
okay right um what else do you need to talk about
so i'm just gonna um pop this in here 'cause i have a slide about decision making which i'd forgotten about
oh sh god we've got five minutes um okay uh back we go um
energy what do you think that's suggesting we're how we're powering the thing i really like the idea
of this kinetic thing where you'd have the back up of the battery but have have kinetic power i mean what does anybody think about that
okay
mm hmm
yeah
yeah
well i suppose that if you're if you're away and you're not using it then you're not using any power either so you'd have the
battery as the kind of to keep it ticking over idea i'm really sorry we're gonna have to wrap up quite quickly we don't have
as much time as i thought um so i think that's what energy is referring to here chip on print is
that that's an industrial design thing is it david okay um as for the case
kind of discussed that
yeah i know we're gonna have like rubber buttons that feel kind of
okay
mm hmm
mm 'kay

could have things like backlighting the buttons and stuff like that
aye that would be a good idea
s so like cur slightly transparent case so it's yellow like tinted yellow but you can maybe see through it is that what you mean
okay
lights
okay
mm
yeah
yeah if you are holding it in your hand you could you could do that couldn't you if you're holding it in your hand you could
do you think okay
mm
yeah okay okay um
yeah
okay
okay
just
okay um right well wouldn't it we do need to make a decision on whether we want to incorporate a jog dial in nice
and quickly um i'm all for them actually i think they're quite you know th very quick to m to use so
does anybody oppose the idea of of incorporating one into the design at all no and the other thing was
um can we think of any way of getting the slogan into this thing
uh huh
uh huh ooh okay we really gotta wrap up so yeah
okay well if we can do that great yeah okay
yeah let's let's try and get the slogan on there um and
mm
okay
right i'm gonna have to i'm really gonna have to hurry you on here 'cause we're we're actually over time um is there anything anybody's
unsure about just for in closing just the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes and so you can see in the screen here what each
of you are gonna hopefully be doing uh i know that the designers are gonna be working with play doh on that
so um that'll be that'll be good um and i'll get the the minutes up as soon as possible anything at all you think we haven't discussed that we need to is everybody kind of happy about what they're gonna be doing
okay
that's kind of a design thing that you guys can can discuss yeah
okay
yeah
to make something flush with the case
okay right
okay
sp kinda grippy
okay
okay i'm gonna have to i'm gonna have to call this to a close 'cause we're way over time so um that's
really good like we've s had much to talk about that um pretty much run out of time to do so so
off you go and design stuff wooh
yeah quite jealous actually
is it working
and so think of this concept
um to research it i've um had a look on the the homepage again it's provided me with more examples of um
previously existing c remote controls um there's a wee bit of discussion about the other existing ones there
um so i've taken the um suggestions from them and tried to incorporate them into this um
so then this we're looking for um suggestions on size th um size of control and the buttons um the shape of the control and whereabout the buttons should be located on the control
um what i found from the research is that most the current controls are just basically big bricks with loads of buttons all over them
um they're not very attractive to look at and they're not very comfortable to hold they're i just hold 'em like big bricks and they're very easily lost um they tend to be very dark colours so if there are shadowy places down the side of couches you can't really see them
um the the controls themselves tend to use a very inconsistent colour scheme
um for instance the stand by button isn't always red uh it really should be it's uh something the user then uh identify
with this is a red switch off that's how it should be um i'm not sure if there's any other examples of that but
something to look out for
um there's a problem that i've i've got couple of preferences for the the end control um i get 'em with the the red colour button for stand by and s the other examples of that um
the buttons should be large they shouldn't be tiny little things like you get on some mobile phones they should be easy to press very comfortable
um one of the examples given on the homepage was um there's an up and down volume button
but both of them have a v  on them so the up volume button looks like it should be a down volume button that's kinda confusing um
should avoid s things like that um if the the corporate colour scheme allows it we should have a
very bright colour so that it can be easily identified anywhere
um obviously trying trying to avoid being tacky there but it could um tie in very easily with your your lime and lemon idea
fantastic
um
any extra features we add beyond the basic ones should be m hidden they shouldn't be on the um shouldn't be visible without
something be opened or some sort of special extra effort um if we did decide to go for voice activation
there sh should always be a button as alternative possibly hidden in the the opened up section um making that something is wrong with it or with somebody's voice maybe
they got a cold or
um we should definitely avoid the big square block look that's just wrong
and um we got an email uh from i think it's the the research department and they've said th the voice control um can now talk back if you ask it a question so it sh it could be good to have them um confirm any action you take
and possibility
right and these are problems i've had with it um i don't know where the slogan should go or really what the slogan is i think it's um
fashion into electronics and we don't know how flexible the colour scheme is i mean you say you wanted the the
corporate colours but they don't say you know if we can use any other colours at all or
that's it
i think i'm cool

right
right



um i think we could go for like um maybe not a p a fruit shape but a very sort of curvy type shape um you could have the same sort of texture and colour as a fruit
um probably something that s sits in your hand comfortably sort of feels right in your hand

see i'm
i'd quite like a sort of uh snowman type shape
um so a p sort of larger bit sits in your hand and then you got maybe another bubble at the top for just any other function you need

um something like that um you got two groups there um maybe it could fold up and you get a third group inside or uh you have volume controls about there
so i reckon it'd look quite nice if we just had um this here had a sorta background yellow and then have sort of a nice bold colour for the buttons
i think that might scare me
i think that'd probably scare me you turn it on your control possessed s
um
nah

um well i think the advanced ones the the ones you don't usually use could be hid inside b um i think the we had were fairly basic ones they'd have to go on the the front somewhere
um
yeah i think so yeah

mm
well but then for um for skipping a large amount of channels you do have to uh to skip the channel button the number part
uh but
yeah
mm



yeah
yeah sure it kinda does make sense doesn't it because when we get into the end of meeting we're kind of talking about action and design as opposed to background everything i have is kinda background

mm hmm
uh that sounds
sure
okay
sure
yeah cool
why don't i get that
hmm
okay
okay
um alright so c is it function f  eight
hmm
come on i think it's working
okay great s so let me just start this
okay great so um uh s move on
uh huh oh where'd it all go it's not good okay lemme just see where i can find it
this looks more like it
i think i just opened up the template sorry about that okay alright so let's have a look here okay so this was the method that um
i've taken uh basically what i wanna do here before we get into it uh too far is i want to show you all the background
information i have that i think we need to acknowledge if we want this to be successful
and uh and then sorta g go through some of the way that i've dealt with that information and then sort of bring us all together into it to see sorta see how this fits in with the overall vision
um so i've tried to take a whole lot of market research and summarise it for us and
then ide identify uh trends that are are sort of in sync and are important to our our uh p project
plan that we have so far and then uh initiate a kind of discussion on design options so that
it sorta helps us to to narrow in on on aspects that will inform other uh other elements of the
of the project
does that make sense tha that sort of strategy i thought that that will impact on the rest of what we do so that's why i suggested we get in this
okay so out of um different uh figures and ratings ob uh of people in general um consumers
in general the number one thing that was found was that uh the br t television remote control a fancy look and
feel okay and not it specified not a functional look or or feel uh b
f f fancy
um however this is where we kinda have to be very i think creative about it number two was that it be innovative
okay so that tells me that we have to find a way to be innovative without a adding just unnecessary um
sort of functional bits to it uh and third priority uh for ease of use so again that kind of
gives us a general picture of how it has to be um quite user friendly while
still having technology
so it i'll just say right away as a bit of a foreshadowing into how we proceed with this in terms of m marketing is that i think um what we should think about is how the um
about how the innovation uh contributes to the look and feel and not so much to
the functionality of it for example like when you pick it up and push it like it all lights up or something you know what i mean like
or it's got something else to it that just seems innovative because obviously the thing that the message here is ease
of use so how do you make innovation make something more more easy to use well that's i guess where we're
gonna go with this okay then there's the other aspect of the back the the market um
research i have here is on fashion style okay which as we've agreed is a priority uh top european fashion
trend um that i read about says there's this emerging theme of
fruit and vegetables okay especially in clothes and furniture and when i first saw that i thought hmm well do we want to actually
try and think about this trend and how we add something to it or we get right into it or we completely steer away from it
do you know what i mean
so my my feeling is that we w do want to observe this trend but we want to think also about the fact that
it sort of has to fit in with something which is not specifically electronics um
'cause i think what we're in what we're in is partly sort of home decor partly something like a computer um
so i think we might wanna be careful about how you know how quickly we create like a remote control in the shape of an apple or something i think that would be pushing
it
and then in terms of m material trends are for things to be soft and spongy and sort of you might say ergonomic
or or friendly to handle which is which also in indicated that last year this was this was not the case so
um probably a lot of the competition on the market will be still in last year's mode so if we
try and really capitalise on that i think that'll be in our favour um
so these this is the summary of everything um style is number one uh thing in the in the market of who we're
selling to uh innovative design technology's also a must in that it's seen it'd be seen to be uh
cutting edge uh but ease of use t has to be insured throughout that was like the number three thing and then at the end
there are vibrant natural colours um
that's the way i interpreted it anyway softness in materials shape and function and so i've written at written at the bottom
to give us sort of a context of discussion mac ipods something which is i'd have to
say very high tech ten gigabytes whatever but when you hold it in your hand there's like no buttons you know what a mac ipod
is
i'm thinking however mac ipod is sort of last year's because it's very hard and sort of glassy and glossy so i'm thinking
if we imagine that we're taking some of the features of a mac ipod and we're then making it s more of like a
more of like a comfortable type of or more of like a
maybe more vibrant to friendly thing to have
um and then so this is w with all that information what i'm what i'm suggesting in this slide here is that we
we take these ideas and as we get into more the more um techni like sort
of production side of things that we think about shape materials and themes or series that go
throughout sort of like a
i dunno like um we think of some kind of a thin theme that unifies it all that we agree on uh sorta like a marketing identity um
does that make sense yeah so so like i threw out a few ideas there just to kinda get us thinking along
those lines like lemon lime i dunno green colours pe whatever it's just an idea 'cause i'm thinking
that some of these ideas will seem quite coherent if we use them in terms of their what people associate this them with in
terms of texture shape colours things like that
like um the ones the ones which i'm most fond of in terms of giving like a theme to it would be like um
like lemon or something like that you know something which is like you see a lot in in other
areas like i see lots of websites and things that seem to associate with like lemon and lime and
so anyway it's just just an idea
i'm thinking maybe we could incorporate some of these features into a fairly um into something which is which seems
to have something to it which is almost gimmicky because like um like something to do with like lighting
within it like you know just within the simple sense when you pick up a phone and touch a button it uh
lights up q usually the buttons light up how can we build on that maybe like it could light up in different colours
or something or or people could buy the buy the control and then it comes with different like
covers or something so anyway those are that's all i have but uh hopefully we can we can revisit those ideas when we get into

yep
did you press f  eight

yeah okay do we have a corporate colour scheme i didn't know
okay
okay
okay
yeah
mm hmm
mm
mm
great lots of good information there

it's a shame the cable wasn't just in the middle of the table huh just um
it takes a second doesn't it

mm hmm
mm hmm
mm
mm hmm

they're standard aren't they
yeah
hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
hmm
hmm
no
yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
hmm
yeah

hmm
hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm mm hmm mm hmm
mm hmm

it can't be curved okay
uh question on can i ask a question
okay
can we uh power a light in this can we get a strong enough battery to power a light
okay
so maybe one of the things we can just try and include is a really good battery
well
i mean i'm thinking it might be
that for uh this to be a high tech thing it's gonna have to have something high tech about it and that's gonna take battery power and to make that to make that a realistic goal i think one of the issues that will come up later is can the battery power it
illuminate the buttons yeah it glows
well m i'm thinking along the lines of you're you're in the dark watching a d v d  and you um you find the thing
in the dark and you go like this and that's what everybody does oh where's the volume button in the dark and
uh y you just touch it or you just pick it up and it lights up or something
like a phone yeah yeah
whereas with phones people charge them once a week we're gonna need to put in a really good battery so people don't have to charge their r remote control every few days
but are people gonna wanna shake their movie controller
right
sure
okay
right
mm hmm
okay great
okay
okay
yeah
yeah
what's that
yeah
okay
well i mean i'm thinking that what we need to do is have something that kind of unifies a lot of the different concepts and if we think
that what we are w our number one marketing motive is um the look
and feel so for the look and feel to seem coherent and not just sorta bits and bits and pieces of of
concept and technology or or whatever or fashion then we should have it kind of come back to one thing that we kind
of all sorta can visualize
um maybe what we could do is t th think about a concept which touches b back
to the on the um the colour you said company colour yellow i mean if we think of something like i
was saying also lime and lemon you know what can we come up with something where we we try and associate it with with like the series
we just come up with something like that we kind of use it as a theme to inspire the
shapes and things

yeah
yeah
no no no not at all it's more more just that we we think about like
what it is we're trying to achieve so and then we have one one sorta theme that we stick with do you know what i mean

right sure
yeah
um can we yeah like to and wha like do you have a
can you like yeah just t we can visualize it
okay
okay
yep
mm

what would it achieve
well
l c  well i'd when you used to mention the l c d  i'd think i wonder what that would be about and the th the thing i could see it helping with
would be if it was somehow connected with um listings so as you scroll through 'cause we said we might have a jog dial
so as you scroll through your stations you can y it actually tells you what it is
right okay
mm hmm mm hmm
mm not real

mm hmm
no

mm mm
well i i was just
yeah
yeah
yeah sure
um i've had kinetic things before and the the the one issue we need to keep in mind with them is that you're committing the user to moving it and watches yeah
sure okay right okay
support for it i mean just it's just worth pointing out because like i've i've known i've known people to have kinetic watches that they wear all the time and it's just like magic because it's always powered and there's no battery
i've also known people to have things like like a jewellery watch they wear from time to time and they eventually just say it's
just too much of a nuisance because i don't wear it all the time like remote control is similar you're away on
vacation i dunno whatever you something and it just starts to get worn down so we should think
about
yeah
yep
and this size here i'd suggest this be small like quite small
um just a a lot of the um
i mean one of the things running through my mind right now i realise we're being efficient to wrap up the meeting and have lots of decisions made um
but we are leaning quite a bit to the side of being low tech rubber buttons plastic frame it's almost like we're reproducing
the same old remote control that's out there should we think about how we are actually getting
this high tech user friendly uh um theme like what is it that we're u we're using
to to achieve those goals like
okay so so backlighting that would be good
yeah clear that'd be
okay
yeah sure
yeah that'd be really good
yeah
sure
yeah yeah
yeah
sure
yeah they they emanate a light through it
'kay
yeah mm hmm um and then the other thing that we we're s we've committed ourselves to achieving
is simplicity and so i'm thinking maybe should we try and think about having something like um some
kind of an innovative concept about how the um the volume and the channels are controlled 'cause that's the main
thing people will f wanna do could we use like a jog dial like a nice just sort of round somewhere on it where you just
roll it or
yeah
mm hmm well why don't we do it like a mouse then
yeah
mm hmm
yeah
yeah sure
mm
yeah
but that's not a bad thing is it because when you think about it the alternative is to go push the button jog dials are much easier than that
you just roll
yeah
yeah
yeah like i mean if we if if we keep coming back to this board here i wouldn't be surprised if we could take this idea imagine that i dunno that it's within the shape of the hand it's quite small
i dunno
yeah
it's small and that we've got like the the l slogan somewhere like on the casing at the side
and that yeah well i mean isn't that what we just h said said we s just have to decide now
yeah and then like a jo
and then like a jog dial somewhere that fits in with the shape of it like i dunno like here in with the
it would get bumped it's doesn't really fit with your hand yeah
or maybe just fit it in like down the middle here
a jog di
yeah it's kind of yeah
yeah
huh
um
yeah i think the jog dial you know it just after you drew that what if it was flat and you just spun it that'd be great
yeah
yep
sure yeah yeah and materials we sorta said we'd do plastic and rubber didn't we and i think maybe we should try and stay away from just the big protruding rubber buttons 'cause that'd just be so standard
something a bit more flush yeah or maybe have rubber incorporated into the case as well so that it has and also t plastic i've seen can get really textured so you can get plastics that actually feel soft in your hand
they feel kind of like um you get pens now and then that you'd think that they were rubber but they're not they're actually just plastic that's textured kind of a little bit like
okay
okay


right uh
so um
so where's the powerpoint presentation
sorry
microsoft powerpoint right
right okay so
right
okay so we've got uh
so we've got new project requirements um
so basically we've got three things and we've got forty minutes in which to uh for this meeting to uh to discuss the various options um
three presentations
i see right that's nice to know one from each of you um new project requirements um so do we want to do the presentation first or do we want to um
w i i got um or or three things basically um
relating to the remote being only for t v  we discussed that last time and in actual fact
that was pr pretty well what we came up with anyway so in fact it actually f we
won't be forestalled in a sense um we've got uh teletext outdated
um did you get any information on that right and
the corporate image was the uh final thing so i
i got that in email form um right okay so
i guess if we go ahead with the uh with the three presentations so we'll start with yourself on the basis that uh
sorry yep
oh
it going
okay
uh there's the rubber on the right i think it's magic
so the the top bit's the power source yes
so the battery is the in the sender
okay so now more design
that's what we like to hear
is it control function ei oh th there you go
well there's a couple of things there um we have to remember that
we have our own um logo and colour scheme so basically we'd have to
uh we'd have to be putting that on um the
the product
i haven't as yet no but uh i got uh i got an email
that basically said to uh make sure that uh whatever device we come up with at the end of the day had
to incorporate um the corporate colour and slogan so uh i'm guessing
that uh uh i notice on the bottom there it's got uh
what's that a p o g e e  that might be the corporate colour scheme although the only the only colour i can see in that is the red

well b uh w
well th the on the well uh for for general television purposes obviously you have
channels one to five at this point in time and we'd have to have some room for uh
future such channels but but
but well possibly but the the other thing is that with um the current expansion
of uh channels uh in the process of taking place certainly the button up and
down but uh i mean how many channels do we have to um actual television channels
do we have to uh prepare for i would have thought that uh
it's forever expanding and at the moment we've got although you've onl you've got the five standard you've got the b b c 
have come up with a further six and uh there's uh i don't know exactly how many channels there are on
uh when you take into account uh sky and various other um
various others so i would've thought that we wouldn't you know rather okay if the time
of flicking from one to other but presumably it'll take a second 'cause you have to be able to stop it maybe you could have a fast forward
on the on the channels that w and then you could dispense with more otherwise y you'd want you'd
want to get fairly quickly to the channel that you wanted
mm hmm
yeah i s i suppose in a sense you could have um if you've got a hundred channels then if you had sort
of an easy way of getting rather than having to go one to a hundred you could go one to one to ten ten to twenty
and then have a second button to get you to the actual channel you want and that would cut
down your time anyway
whatever okay okay limit the number of buttons user friendly
yeah
well that's true yeah you could get fifty by five and a zero or whatever that that makes sense
yeah
does
so w so what was the circular thing that you were
if it's just for t v  which is what it is at the moment
mm hmm
well we've we've got um that it's remote for t v  only otherwise project
would become too complex with uh which would endanger the time to market
was one of the considerations i'm i don't know d did you have that information behind the marketing or was i meant to give you that information
right
right okay so basically time to market seems to be important therefore speed of delivery we've only got about another four hours left
yeah i think she said twenty seconds to um
what was that last wee bit there speech recognition right okay but that was only for young people that preferred it older people didn't
well that's right
sounds reasonable
mm hmm
yeah so
well if you're trying to avoid having a second product 'cause obviously you could have a second product that gave you the right pitch which would set the remote off to say here i am sort of thing you know without sound recognition but if you
i know um i was gonna say a sharp noise you know a clapping of hand or whatever
you'd want to try and av just have the one product that if
yeah um i dunno um talking about vo i mean obviously if you've got voice
recognition then you can do it in that way because it'll recognise the voice and you can give it a command a set
command whatever that happened to be but you've then got the point if if you're not going with uh voice
recognition then
mm so uh any sugges well any conclusions
well if it does then we can't it's that simple because we've got uh th th three um primary um uh requisites from uh
from and email uh that was sent to me whereby we had the design logo was one which we've
already mentioned we've got um the remote was only for the television and not for because that
would make it too complex and we have to get it market quickly and the uh third thing was that um
teletext uh as far as uh the management is concerned um is becoming dated
uh due to the popularity of the internet
so that means that uh so these are the sort of three um
extra parameters that have been put on this uh project so we're being focused effectively
directly at a television and it seems to me that the management is uh wanting us to go down a narrow path
and not opening out so anything that uh is to be added such as voice recognition
et cetera has to be very simple and has to be very quick because
time to market is is critical s
it would but probably quick and simple is primary rather than
added extras added extras would be nice but the primary consideration is to get the project finished within
uh this short time window which effectively now is sort of four hours so
and if and we've gotta get to the end uh d d i think i think first and foremost we've gotta get to the end and then get to the end with
um added extras if possible
okay right okay uh so i need to
right so i don't know how long we have left of our uh time but we have to make the decisions on uh the remote control functions
and how we were planning to proceed so that at the next uh meeting
each person that's got a a a task to do is clear from this meeting what that task is
we'll also know w when the next meeting is i um so we'll know how long we've got to
complete that task and then we can report back at the next meeting and say right okay yes we've achieved this or we haven't achieved this
this is how far we've progressed does that make reasonable sense
so we have to come effectively to the decision on the remote functions so that
you can decide what you're gonna be doing
and if dur between the time of this meeting finishing and the next meeting starting if you get any
additional information that uh only you have at that point in time
you'd think would be relevant to other people in terms of their des decision making um process then we should communicate
that as quickly as possible and not wait until the next meeting
do it via the email so that rather than coming you know if you get the information
just before the next meeting that's fine come along with it in the next meeting we can discuss it then and take whatever action is appropriate but if you
get it well before the next meeting let everybody else know 'cause that might have an impact on their uh
on what they come up with effectively at the next meeting okay
right is there
i would guess so
yep
i w well uh i
something simple uh if if our primary consideration is to get it there in time time's short
you want something to meet the major concerns of the consumer so that we can have that as a selling point
for the product something that's quick and simple so sounds good
well so maybe a clap rather than a whistle would be on the basis
that if we've got if we're catering to the whole age range you want something that's easy to do
now something that doesn't like whis uh well i i i don't know well if you think that more people can whistle than clap
then that's fine then go for that option but if i would have thought that more people could clap rather than whistle so uh
so clap option
okay
uh ef effectively that's what the that's what they're saying that uh if uh if people are now using the internet then you don't need teletext so so take out teletext
yeah
no
but the but that's relying on the television market changing to an automatic and
if it is at the moment that's fine but at the moment it's not so it seems to me that you have to have a device
that caters 'cause otherwise it would make it uh your device would become inoperable or
only operable in certain circumstances and the idea is to have an international market which is
and it's also m it's the the product we've got is something that's at the i would have said the lower end of the
s of the cost scale so we're not really going for something that's uh
terribly high tech
possibly
that's right

okay well
mm
so y ah that's a very good idea
so you keep um right we've got five minutes before we wind up this meeting so i've been told
i don't know if you've got the same okay so so keep um
keep detailed functions um
hidden at the back
ah
mm hmm
that's right
data functions hidden at back can bring out when needed
that's right so we're dis so you've got which ones are gonna be on the front and which ones are gonna be on the back we have to decide
i guess so
so on front
numbers
volume
sorry
mm
mm hmm
so so are you having the stand by on the front then

well
channel up and down what else have we got what was that sixteen
volume button how many volumes
right okay
power button stand by channel up and down so is that it
okay that's sixteen buttons you reckon and then at the back
okay so on the back
it'll have brightness contrast anything else you're also gonna have the channel tuner as it were
tuner would that have up and down
okay okay
um up volume yeah i would have thought so
okay
yeah yeah
well you might get some research
okay right so i'll do the minutes of uh this meeting and we'll meet back at i'm not sure um forty minutes i believe is the time
come on
we have a i guess we have a presentation each 'cause i've got one um
mm hmm

uh we didn't no
i d i didn't personally
okay that's fine
i'll just um i'll grab the wire out the back of this one

i'm not quite sure how it
control
doesn't seem to be quite working at the moment
alt function f  eight
again not doing anything
oh
pressed about five times now
okay that's me
okay um i have to go again
hopefully that should be it this time
okay i think we're there that's good
okay um
okay i'm gonna be looking at the working design um of the of the
remote control um i've just got three sections first is the research i made on the
on the remote control itself um and then that involves the components required in it and the systems uh
design of the actual the actual remote
um so having researched the existing models within the market um i found my research off the internet
um i've established what the components required for the remote control to function actually are and then also the methods
in which these components interact together for the remote to actually do what you want it to do and how
it connects with the television um the basic components are an energy source
which i guess um in most existing models would be a battery supply
whether that'll be sort of two batteries four batteries um it may vary we then have the user interface
which is basically the like the the buttons on the actual remote um the various functions used
for changing channel uh channel up and down volume things like that um there's also a chip inside
the remote which does all the computer type things and then the sender which
um
is usually i've found an infra red device which sends a signal
to the actual television um and the last part is receiver which is important in the system but is not actually part of the remote itself because that's
obviously found in the television um i'm gonna have to actually draw
on the board because uh it was a little tricky on powerpoint to get this working so
i'll just go through there
s um um do we have a cloth to wipe this down with or oh i'll j
oh i see oh okay i'll get rid of the bear 
okay that's great
okay so we start off with a um battery suppl uh no a power supply which we'd probably get it's probably gonna be the battery um
we then have
a particular button which may be that's obviously there's lots and lots of different buttons um but this is how the basic system works um that sends after you press that that sends the message to
the chip which um then sends
it sort of interprets which button you've pressed and then sends the appropriate message to the sender
um
so that's that's the remote in itself that's the components of the remote and how they work together so this is the uh user
interface
um this is the chip itself which then and that's the that's the infra red
sender and then on the separate thing we have on the
on the television
we have a
a receiver
and the sender sends a message to the receiver 'kay
ah yes that's the power source um
going on to personal preferences i've said that battery seems the best option for the actual remote just because of the size you
don't want a a cable attached to the remote otherwise it's not it's not really a remote um and then the sender
and infra red um has been used quite successfully if the battery's on reasonable power they always seem to
work fairly well you don't have to be point directly at the television itself um
yes
'kay and that's it for the moment

would you be able to get rid of the the extra buttons here the the sort of circular section because that seems to be for a video as well so we could dispense with that little bit as well and just get it down to just the numbers and the volume possibly
j yeah yeah yeah j yeah just this little bit is that i think that's still um a video remote part so maybe we could get rid of that as well
it's just people are used to seeing that so if we didn't have them then they might think it's

hmm



okay yeah
i suppose with nine you've got the the like the last one which makes the tenth means you uh it's like uh multiples you can put them together so you can make any number so with that we'd kind of by pass any problems with
yeah
yeah 'cause that facilitates having all the numbers you could ever need
um
so we could get it down to what
so we get to how many buttons have we got we've just got ten eleven twelve th we got fourteen that we need i guess
um which isn't really too many that'll be quite easy to make a user guide for a fourteen button remote
'kay
'kay

ah yes yes that seems good
i think if you just give it a second to maybe catch up
i'm sure we'll have by the end of today

mm
no what i maybe think is um
it seems the technology would be quite advanced for that and they might end up costing more than our twelve fifty budget for
for the speech recognition um
and possibly the thing about the about the remote being lost we could have you know with your mobile phone you lose that and you can ring it maybe we can have some
kind of sensor which is kept somewhere where you can some kind of buzzer system between the two so you can press a button which is always kept in one place
and then it maybe buzzes to somewhere else wherever the remote actually is
that is true yes
hmm
so i guess it'd be something we could like attach to the or like the same technology could be put inside the
inside the remote
yeah
yeah if we if we could have it in the actual remote like everything in one one device

you could have an option to turn it off or
perhaps um
so that would solve the problems with the t v  kind of speaking to the remote and changing its own channels
mm
'kay
yes
has to be simple enough to

i suppose if we could get something in which was quite quick and simple that would give us an advantage over the other remotes um
'kay
mm hmm
yes
um
yes that seems right
mm hmm
okay
maybe we should concentrate just on the whistle back function at the moment and if something comes back

i'd go more yeah f more for clap
did we decide on having the ten um the ten numbers and then the the little digit next to it which kind of enabled you to put them together
okay ten numbers and then some kind of device to allow uh
i'll put delay to allow um multiple numbers
or multiple digits
did we decide anything about um the other functions as in setting the audio and tuning it and stuff like that you had an had an idea about the menu
but just thinking um people probably i mean you don't have you only have to probably tune in the t v  once but you have to be able to tune it that once so and if finally the t v  breaks you get a new one you're gonna have to be able to tune it you can't really avoid that except the new digital markets which do it by themselves
so that'll be in
yes
yeah
yeah
yeah yeah
yeah so how would this menu function work would you maybe have like one menu button then you'd use the other buttons maybe the number buttons to actually do the separate functions
okay

we're gonna have the the individual numbers and then a menu function and maybe sort of a slightly more advanced
um instruction booklet to come with it to guide presu uh i think it'd be quite hard just for people to grasp
um just off like the menu use different buttons you maybe have to have like some better instructions of how that would actually
work
right okay um
that also goes back to the original design when we saw those two and there was the one on the left hand side which had all like the double functions and stuff which kind of looked too busy and had too much on it so
that is that is a good idea actually sor sort of a second
okay
uh not quite but i guess
keep the other buttons but hide them away
so
so um we're gonna have to have to work out what's gonna be on these other functions as as well so we're gonna have like two separate two separate lists i guess
so sh
should we decide in the next couple of minutes and then
so on the
about the number
um the volume up and down
shall we have a mute button as well
a mute button as well
yeah or
but then they might not buy it if they haven't got one 'cause people might just be too fickle and not want to change
we can send out a flier with the device saying that you shouldn't leave it on stand by
i think you probably should
um are we gonna have the channel up and down as well as the number buttons
okay so we'll have um
so we've got ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen there
is there anything else um

maybe if we're gonna run out of time one of us should come up with a list of these and then get back at the next meeting just at the start and say what they're gonna be
so tuner up and down i guess
um up tune one way tune the o i i dunno i dunno possibly
oh yeah and th and a enter button just to select yeah okay
um i guess we're keeping s it simple we don't really need any other audio funct uh functions because it's just volume up volume down
um
do they have their own do they have their own controls on their actual products then or do you have to do it via the remote
yeah i suppose if we've got their if they've got their own controls then we can avoid it for ours just to keep it simple
oh okay
right
um
maybe unless something comes up then we should i think
well shall we look into that and just get back together
'kay
yeah

no


what is it
i think you've got to do um control f  eight
shift f  eight
ah there it's doing something

i think it's that little
right
thank you
mine's not quite as complicated as all that

did i press function yeah
oh
um okay so i'm gonna talk a bit about the technical functions design i'm louisa
the user interface designer as you know um so the m basic method of this is to send
a signal from the remote to the television set so that a desired function is performed
um an example of the function could be to change the volume up or down uh so obviously you need two different
buttons for that
um to change the channel either by pressing the number that you want or by channel up or down
um to switch the television on or off maybe a standby button um here are two example remotes
um by the look of it they both have um kind of play and fast forward rewind functions so i think
they incorporate a kind of video function which we won't have to worry about uh but
as you can see the left remote is quite um quite busy looking quite complicated um
whereas the right remote is much simpler it looks much more user friendly
um so my personal preference would be the right remote so it's got nice big buttons it's got a very
limited number of buttons um they're nice kinda clearly labelled um i
like the use of the kind of um symbols like the triangles and the squares and the arrows as
well as the words on the um kind of play functions and all that so it's very very user friendly and
it's got a little splash of colour could maybe do with some more colour um
hmm do we get to see that will you be presenting that in a bit
hmm
what do you mean by the circular section like all of that bottom bit
yeah
yeah and i don't really think that you need nine numbers i mean how often do you use seven eight and nine i think just one to six and then channel up and down should be enough
like how often do you hit nine
hmm


um some remotes have kind of favourite options where if you always flick from channel one to channel six um if that's a favourite you just like by pass two to five
hmm
mm um but i think a lot of um like cable and sky and stuff that would be tuned to one channel and then you'd have another remote for all of those channels like to get to fifty five and the higher numbers
yeah
but i suppose nine's not really excessive i suppose it does make a good pattern
okay
um i think that's just for a video so we wouldn't need any of that at all
mm hmm

okay so is everyone happy with that
right well that's the end of my presentation
do a lot of um

there's key rings um that you kind of whistle at or clap at i can't remember and then they whistle back or something like that that'd probably be really simple they're cheap


yeah
well i think it'd be really easy and it'd be a big advantage if we did have some sort of um kind of whistle back kind of function 'cause that'll solve kind of the frustration of losing it

yeah
i don't really know about the voice recognition thing
mm hmm
yeah and that wouldn't put off the kind of older generation either 'cause everyone can whistle or clap and they wouldn't have to be kind of scared of this new technology

'kay we've already decided that we don't need a teletext button haven't we
is that one of the
hmm
right
yeah i think so so zero to nine

hmm
mm
yeah

yeah like the volume or something
yeah 'cause you do need um kind of brightness and contrast and everything as well my dad was watching a film the other week and it was too dark so i had to go through it and turn the brightness up
well if we're trying to keep it slee sleek and sexy as well have you seen those remotes where kind of um the bottom bit slides down so there's kind of um everything else revealed so you don't use it that much you don't have to see it all the time but it's all there if you need it
like a hidden panel
hmm and that'll be better for the older generation as well 'cause well my dad doesn't like anything that you've got to kinda flick through a menu but he can pretty much read a button if it's displayed properly
yeah
and the volume
um
yeah
yeah i think they're handy
i know it's probably like um
not an issue to raise here but um the whole thing about not using your standby uh because of the
like waste of electricity have you seen the adverts like if you boil the kettle that's full that's a waste if you leave your telly on standby it powers
blackpool for a certain amount of time like we should maybe try to discourage people from standby
yeah it's maybe too much of a big issue for here uh oh danger sign
yeah but a little bit smaller compromise
right
on mute
so
and then
mm hmm
uh there's audio functions
yeah
i think they normally do
yeah
so i think um
there's quite a lot of like dolby surround studio surround sort of things
um maybe for the younger market
um i think they've got their own controls in this kind of like hidden panel
oh no i mean um like there's kind of individual buttons for them like on the t v  remote but i don't really know what they're for i've never used them i just know they're something to do with dolby

right
yeah i've got one too
mm hmm
mm hmm
hmm
there's usually a little thing in the top right for the oh hang on it's just coming on



okay
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm

mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
um
i'm not sure i had i've had some market information but not from the company no

okay
'kay
i'm gonna pull this off

uh huh
okay

i'll give it another go
yeah there we go
right we've done some research into the functional requirements that people want out of their remote control and first off we should state that th the remote control's for controlling the t v 
and um how do people use it we asked them sort of which buttons were useful for them um
how d how does a remote control look and feel for them and what improvements would would they like to remote
control and we did that by sort of giving them a questionnaire that we'd prepared and asking them to fill in
the answers
and three quarters of them found that remote controls are ugly and that a sort of even higher proportion would spend more for a sort of s uh a fancier remote control
and that of all the buttons on the remote control the sort of setting buttons for sort of the
picture picture and brightness and the audio settings um they weren't used very often
at all people concentrated on the channel buttons and the volume buttons and the power buttons
uh we also asked them about speech recognition uh for remote control and young people
were quite receptive to this but as soon as we got sort of over about into a thirty five to forty
age forty five age group and older
people people weren't quite so keen on speech recognition there's a lot more th there's a lot lot more older people who didn't know
whether they wanted it or not as well um we also asked what frustrated people about remote controls
and the number one frustration was that the remote was lost somewhere else in the room and that
they couldn't find it and the second second biggest frustration what that if they got a new remote control
it was difficult to learn um all the buttons and all the functions and to find your way around it
okay so
my personal preferences from the marketing is that we need to come up with some sort of sleek sort
of good looking high high tech a design which looks high tech basically um
and that we should come up with fewer buttons than most of the controls on the market and we should sort of concentrate on
the channels and sort of power and also volume and that sort of thing as as louisa said
um we could maybe come up with a menu a sort of a an l c d  menu for other functions
on the remote control that's worth thinking about um and maybe we could think about speech recognition
as well because um sort of young people are
perhaps the ones that are gonna buy buy our new product if we aim it at sort of you know sort of a high tech design
that that might be the market that we're we're looking for
and we could maybe think about using speech recogniti recognition as a way to find the remote control if it's lost in a room
rather than sort of um having it to speech recognition to change the channels
'cause there's a problem with that in that the television makes noise so it could end up talking to itself and changing its channel
okay um and that's the end of the slide show that's it cool
um about speech recognition yeah
youn young people pref yeah they s they said that they'd be interested in a remote control which offered that possibility and as you go up through the age groups people got less and less interested in sort of a a remote control that you could talk to so
yeah yeah
yeah
yeah
uh huh
yeah
yeah we'd have t that would mean we'd have to put two products together as well which which again would probably be a bit expensive but
yeah
yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah
yeah
mm hmm
yeah

um would it take quite a while to sort of develop the speech recognition software in the remote control considering
yeah
mm hmm
okay
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
so
about five minutes
mm hmm
mm hmm
okay yeah
mm hmm
okay yep
yeah
mm hmm
so do we need to decide on the functions now s
mm hmm
yeah and
yeah and that was that was the number one sort of frustration that people said so
i don't think there's anything else on the market that does that so
mm hmm
mm hmm
no not everyone can whistle can they though
no clapping i think clapping yeah yeah
yeah

taking out teletext okay
mm
i think nowadays you can just get ones where it gives you a sort of a second or two to press another number so you can press any two and it'll sort of put them together
yeah
yeah
yeah
uh we could possibly put an l  a sort of a l c d  menu in but that again is probably an expense that
yeah
mm hmm
yeah
yeah
yeah
i s i suppose um
if people are buying remotes then they're probably buying it to replace another remote 'cause all most tellies come with
remotes so i mean we're maybe talking about replacing remotes for slightly older televisions so
we maybe need to keep the the tuning function in
yeah that would be a good idea yeah
mm hmm
hmm
uh
i'm not sure whether the sort of having people have a booklet 'cause one the second most annoying thing that people found
was having to learn the new one so maybe next to each of the buttons you know each of them could have a number
and then also a function written next to it so you're basically pressing
right
okay
yeah
yeah yeah
mm hmm
yeah
yeah
yeah
so th the
the detailed ones would be sort of brightness uh sorta
mm hmm
yeah
mm hmm and probably a power one as well dunno
mm hmm
yeah

yeah
yeah
okay
um 'cause yeah the market research said there is quite a lot of people do just zap around and flick so
um
numbers is ten volume is
twelve th yeah si one up one down
and a mute yeah that's sixteen isn't it yeah
i don't think so no
you've got
brightness and contrast
yeah
yeah
yeah
and then maybe sort of an enter button for
sort of s you know saying that you want that particular thing tuned in so you go up and down and then it pick it finds something and then you wanna press enter to select it yeah
yeah
yeah
mm hmm
okay
right
okay
okay
okay uh for for uh the noise sensitive table project um
we decided to um to take the noise uh as input and uh give a feedback
uh with leds on the table so this is uh one of the the possibilities that were
offered to us but uh we decided to do to do uh it this way
yes the the first uh the first idea of the project uh was to have um the whole table covered by leds
but uh for the prototype of this isn't this is not the the way we implement
it now but uh in fact we have a there was th
yes th there was the the restriction that if we cover the le the table with leds uh
some won't be visible because uh you have uh yes so um if
there is information displayed under the the sheets uh the it won't be um
very useful so we decided to have it uh yes thirty centimetre uh
at each side
weeks
this is for prac practical reason and uh also a matter of time because uh
yes but uh th there are o other problems like um yes the the information display on the sheets so we don't know if it's
yes true
and there is uh a lot of programmes now about this implementation is it's not uh it's not obvious hmm still in progress almost done
mm hmm
yes

mm yes
yes uh
i have one or or two question i don't know if you want to to begin with the the explanation about the the release
o okay
so um i have actually two questions that are uh just practical question abo about my um my implementation now uh i
no
so and the first information is um about the the noise level n
not the noise level the sound level uh because uh what you get from from the microphones
is uh a curve and um a way the way uh it is implemented
now uh to detect yes you have a uh i have packets uh for uh let's
say uh this is uh this is uh not uh fixed but uh i have packets
for about um uh alpha second so it's uh second and uh
on these packets i want to know the the sound level the average sound level so uh
the way i do it now is uh to to take uh each top of the curves' bottoms
and uh just making leverage this
but i don't know if it's it's not really um the best way to do it but i don't know uh if
yes
okay so this is this the the first question
yes but i think uh this is two different problems uh the filtering must be must be done before
and after that uh if you have uh a cleaned curve and you can uh just apply uh functionally
and uh the second question was about um uh filtering and uh f f t 
yeah what you can get from it uh
general questions
okay
mm hmm uh o yes i will just add something um
is there a way to uh to from one uh
from one stream to uh to build two streams that correspond to the the voice
of one people and the voice of the second the
yes

no and it it this is not uh
a sound question sound related question
line in
uh yes the the communication between the the extension and is uh of the
no no no uh okay
and the fire wire port and there is an extension for this this uh this device connected to it uh with uh optic fibre
yes uh yes
be because for now uh i'm just sampling the sound that uh eight thousand so uh just
uh something very very rel i could uh even uh go to lower
but uh this is just to get the the s the noise the sound level but uh if
i want to record the conversation with uh uh a processing
after th
yes to to have a better sound quality uh perhaps it's better to have a x  array yeah something like that
yes
okay
mm hmm
sure sure but uh what is the the gain in terms of uh position
uh uh uh centimetres or uh more
okay
m uh what you get is uh the real position or uh just uh the angle at which the the sound comes
mm hmm
mm hmm
okay
yes sure
yes uh because uh there there is just um four microphones that are eight
okay yes okay but there are in uh in a plan okay because uh at at t p f n 
there is a lab that is uh has done almost the same thing but they have uh eight microphone that are uh
at uh yes the eight um the eight uh uh cor corner
of uh a cube yes
the elevation no but uh what is could be relevant it's not uh almost it's not always the case with the the um
yes the the position the the radius of the
yes it could be
yes okay
yes because um because i the um the distance between the the microphone is too uh is too low to
mm hmm
yes sure
yes but i think the the most relevant part is the um the other uh the hardware that synchronize the microphones and that
yes
yes
mm not maximum the the average on the on the packets
uh yes the the i take the the b i g when i go up to the the curve uh
i'm uh on the at the local maximum i take it then the next uh
local minimum and uh taking this uh this range doing average
on it
yes
difference
difference is uh is that if i just uh
mm yes
yes
okay
a you have uh you have fifteen implementations uh
yes
okay
sixteen
sure
okay okay
yes and then i just uh because uh we are using um uh an open s an
open source framework to do this there is uh something i don't know if you know i know it uh
calls sphinx that is doing uh s sorry
yes doing um voice recognition and uh
i just use it for the for the for the microphone and the acquisition so uh there is
uh already uh an f f t  uh module implemented in it i didn't test it
but um
yes sure
y yes for the for the the position
also for detection
mm hmm
mm hmm
'kay yes sure okay
yes
no
yes
okay
y you have to detect uh an event on one microphone and uh know when it's happened on uh on the other one no okay
mm hmm
mm hmm
it's related to the number of microphones around no
okay
mm hmm
okay this is a measure of the activity o okay
th there there is a distance but it's not very uh very effective
as as you mentioned
it's
and uh from from this kind of if information you can uh let's say have uh a finger print of the user to know uh if this is the same user speaking
so
not sure because the the um
okay
which
range
yes okay
so
this is this is a bit arbitrary because uh perhaps uh person two will have uh some frequencies in the range of
okay
and if you reconstruct the stream from this uh this range you will uh get something uh that is uh
okay
mm hmm
and you can you can um this way you can filter uh perhaps some range that are uh just very low frequencies for uh perhaps uh a noise or
the yes the fan
okay
yes but but then this this is very interesting because uh this way you can detect uh if someone
is talking if someone uh has an uh some noise with uh perhaps putting his uh
his cap on the on the table perhaps if there is a laptop and uh in one position
and you can classif uh classify and this is
yes she' very good

okay
yes
yes
and the the length of the time frame has um an inference of uh on uh which parameters
okay
th there i uh let's say if you use a one second window
uh the in fact the the frame lengths will be uh very uh very uh i
yes

okay
they they won't be visible on the on the wavefo okay
yes
but the the the the long uh the longest frame you would use would be one hundred
at most okay

okay yes
'kay so you can yeah
okay
enter uh when user is
uh yes and before i forg forget it uh i have one question uh
you say you do the processing after uh afterwards and uh what is the
the cost yes the the length one one or uh bit longer
okay
yes but matlab is very uh very effective for uh matrices and uh
okay
yes
okay
yes
relative yes mm
yes
and even if you use uh four microphones to get uh not good
okay
okay

and eight is uh is good
there i yes but uh
yeah
yes one two degree is very very small for uh for our application because we want we really want
to detect uh if th this is the same person that is speaking or not if there is uh
an error of uh let's say uh ten fifteen degrees and but uh it is um capable of
uh seeing it as two different person there is not problems with the
okay and the number of sectors is uh is not dependent of uh the number of microphones
okay

if there is uh two two person the same sector i see
mm hmm
mm hmm
no geometry is not we have not uh thought a lot about it
yes
f f t 
but th uh uh i think what is very important here is the synchronization of the microphones right
okay um uh i'm speaking about it because uh we
wanted uh to do this table in uh a mid tech way let's say a
cheap way to have not uh very expensive tables so i don't know if um
uh what i've seen w on our website was uh that the this installation was uh
a bit expensive uh but i'm trying to uh
to to to see what is very important and uh what is not uh for
yes
sure
yes sh i think you have to uh to uh
it sh
these are these are um some kinds of uh and this one yes okay
expensive because because uh of the quality of the the
and they are plug in the on the x l r  or uh
yes
okay for the our we'll we we'll uh
mm hmm
let's have a break
no i don't uh

well i guess it's just a restriction we took so so we don't uh the m
amount of money we have to spend otherwise we could have uh we could imagine to have a whole table of of uh
s well of l e d s and then y you can really start to to
some regions of the table so yeah

oh let's
does

yeah i can just explain my project it's completely different from this one well it's also about
tables but the idea is if uh uh the several students come to a table with their laptops
they should be able to to share information easily and uh in fact w
what we we are doing now we project um another screen on on the table
and different people are are are able to use their their mouse of their laptop to go to the
to the project screen there and uh the project screen is just another windows machine
that is running so you just have another f computer more or less you can use but you can use it
with your your own mouse and keyboard
exactly
but uh in contrary to to having al another keyboard and mouse that only one person can use now the different persons can use the the screen um at the same time with the with the mouse
i'll s still the same subjects it's it's collaborative work but uh
it has nothing to do with uh audio processing and uh l e d  so
anyway uh i think the the details of the implementation is not that important it's more important that first
we want to to have some events like two people are talking or one one started and
another started and uh well more or less broke into the speech of the first person
and so on and then you can start to visualise these uh different situations

well that's uh i guess it's first prototype i you see we start with uh people two
people talk or and don't and don't they uh afterwards uh one could imagine
that you for example you can detect that someone is a bit angry or is uh yelling and
wi with different colours with uh with different colours on on table you could uh display this this
uh give some feedback but uh
yep that's uh
once we get the hardware
mm
yes everything from um multi switch administration of uh audio and how you can uh analyse it uh what information you can get out of speech and so on so
probably it's uh it's f be a good idea if you have s two uh with um with source like
uh books or web page centre give a lot of information how it is audio programming and so on works cetera
maybe you you know some at least a good book that's uh dealing with this stuff
mm hmm
and is possible to do this in real time
that's uh

no

yeah but what happens if o someone is standing then

yeah
no no no in fact uh that's uh it's another thing this optic well uh m we have
ye
actually it's not really an extension to the first box just an indu industry standard uh uh protocol between these two uh
well well there's a special protocol to to deliver uh audio signals and uh its path through uh o um
well actually just to have the the icsla e uh possibly to to branch icsla
hmm
no
uh huh
well uh so you say this one already works to uh to tell the the direction um
would it also work if you placed uh the microphones at at the border of the table you see
now you you have it quite central and uh what happens if if you put them here on around the table
would it work as well or
you just didn't try or
mm hmm
yeah
yeah it is clear this
no
mm hmm
no
you lose information um
yeah
well that's something with f f t s
and the phase
so the magnitude you don't really use or and for this uh
well uh uh uh i did a speech processing uh course and i'm not sure if they a uh they also um mm learns that that we more used the face than the magnitude so uh i guess the
uh huh

mm hmm
and what happen uh if two person are talking at the same time this it just get two sectors that are higher than others no
sounds

well uh uh
mm hmm
yeah
no it's more than
no it's uh
mm hmm
i'll show you this afterwards
now if you don't really detect the pitch ch can say that uh no persons
it's not really meaningful well if you do this
somehow
mm hmm
mm thanks
well otherwise it could also just rely on the frequency band separation and detect that way the different persons and th then you don't really know where around the table these but uh
well d depends with how you do it but if if you place the the microphones uh n yeah uh
that way you can separate where where is the the voice loud with uh or the loudest
well it's quite different thing and uh you don't really get uh a name for it but uh
at the end it it depends a bit what you want if you are

i guess it's completely other approach so uh
expensive
ca can you uh say a number
okay
okay
should i start maybe by presenting the project little bit okay so historically
it was um uh last year prof delambeaux in uh his c s c w  classes uh asked the student
to design a table and all the students and guillaume wa was a student
of this class was very excited uh to design such a table so he decided
to um to make more research on this topic so the general topic uh is
about uh interactive table um disappearing computer um what
is the other one um um
na uh in the general fi field of uh collaborative computer supported collaborative
learning
so the idea is we have different people collaborating uh in a pedagogical purpose
and uh we know that when we put a computer in front of them uh it
doesn't help focusing on collaboration so if we make the computing um
functionalities disappearing on on the in the furniture in the wall or other
things like that we may more efficiently support uh collaboration than the the
learning so i arrived uh in june something like that a couple of
month ago uh guillaume and uh michael uh are
two students that are working uh four four months to
their master project and they start working on two uh different uh sub projects
so guillaume is working on the noise sensitive table it's uh what we are discussing about uh
today
so the idea is uh okay w we have in the lab a notion about
um root mirroring the idea is if we can provide a feedback to people working together
uh it may help them self regulating their activity their collaboration so
could be normative or not in our own case we want to have uh a table that would be accessible
by by students uh at o p f l  we are uh
at o p f l  uh the learning centre will be built in a couple of uh years so the idea we we
will have plenty of rooms uh like in libraries or meeting rooms where student will arrive and work
so if we have this table uh that is accesi accessible to students if they arrive if we provide a feedback
of um who is talking um instantly the uh at one moment
or uh through time or the turn taking uh maybe they will just by seeing
an explicit uh feedback of that they will um take profit uh of it and um
yes
the idea is to have uh peripher peripherical uh information we don't want people
to focus on uh what's going on uh what on the feedback so we don't want histogram or very
precise information but we will uh have leds that will be distant there will be six centimetres
between each led with a blurring glass the idea is to have more um a kind of uh
art artistic uh feedback to have a kind of general feeling of what's going on something
about
uh dance
for practical reasons
we kept uh one paper sheet
so uh the first shape of the table the shape of the table obviously is one of the factor on that will change the
collaboration so uh but we don't want to start with too many parameters so we start with a table
that is approximatively the tab uh of the table where we are now and we will have uh
a square shape like this that will be here and a second one that would be there so we will have something like
this like this that will be the our first uh real prototype
okay and the so this l e d  modules are being uh designed uh now we
should have them in a couple of weeks and uh we will be able to
uh start uh evaluating uh the prototypes uh uh about
the c s c w  class that will start at the end at the beginning
of november uh so the student will be asked to design uh a table so to find the shape
uh of the table to get uh who the and put that uh on the um on table
uh legs and we will uh so at the beginning we wanted to put this l e d 
modules uh in the tables
but we won't make it because uh for solidity reason of the table you know it's not very
uh strong uh wood um so we will rather beam uh the l e d 
on the table so we come back to a more richer display b but we will um restrict it
to a small uh to have the same display led lights uh that will be
distant uh six centimetres between leds so we will simulate our
and we have yeah and we have the feeling that to have the information embedded in the
table make it part of the table it i don't know we'll we we will try uh
we don't really know what uh will happen with this prototype we are very excited about that
okay uh maybe before uh going on on this subject we can talk talk a little bit on uh
huh
so based on the fact that most of the p f l  student have their own laptop uh the
idea is the similar idea uh is to okay people are coming on a should be able
to very easily uh use some um resources offered to them
so so the idea is to help them socialising organising their own work
and uh not in a classroom setting but in a social place where they could gather
different directions
okay so uh maybe we can focus a little uh uh bit more on the what we have done about uh the
noise sensitive table tell you about uh what we're interested in on the
so we start so guillaume started by uh developing the application that get the
audio input so we want it to have a modular architecture to be able
to improve each uh layer separately so the audio input uh is quite
basic no we u we use uh sound cards to to get uh the
signals and to detect to uh on to ha and we have a threshold to detect uh when someone
is talking at least when the noise is uh at uh is bigger that uh specific levels
and then we get this information about people talking not talking and to say okay uh this one is talking
for x  time or uh has been talking uh x  percent of the five last
minutes or two people are talking together so this is more semantic uh layer
uh we call that interaction uh models and uh uh so when different conditions are
trigger are detected we trigger on the interaction event so very simple one could
be one person is talking so it's uh the easy one
it's still in progress still in progress

so the last layer is about this visualisation w we will uh we are thinking about the visual grammar
meaning that when we have an interaction event that is uh fired we uh will associate
uh a way of visuali visualising it so for instance if someone is talking
uh we can just have a light that will centre on the point that is uh close
to him that could be an uh instant uh feedback and if he has been talking
maybe seventy percent of the last five minutes as me uh
uh it it may be reflected as the um intensity or size of a s a cycle
centre on the same point and then if there's turn taking we can show waves of light going from uh me
to you uh or from other people or using the centre part of the table to show some
something more about the um uh more general uh dynamic
or laughing
yes
in uh we can change inte so we have uh eight by eight uh two times
leds each uh led is actually three leds um th uh m g b  led and
we can change the intensity so it's already quite a rich uh feedback
yes and just a last thing so this table is uh two different
things it's uh one object that will uh g provide a feedback to the terminal users people
collaborating around uh the table but it also a tool for us as a researcher to
test uh both the interaction event we want to detect
and to test the visualisation so um we will be able to edit some uh interaction
rules and the visualisation uh grammar and uh we will be able
to process to post process some conversation just to see what happens and to uh
have these um models on feedback working when people are using the table
so i think it was
yes
um
maybe we could summarise the question we were thinking about
so basically what we want we want to know when a  is talking b  is talking and uh
basic information we need
maybe we can uh go through the different questions and then you can organise your own um i would
just add something uh we are not interested so much in sound level but uh in the level of
uh the sound that corresponds to voice
mm mm okay it was just a
okay go on
and i would add uh one more it's about um because what we can
uh record is uh sound uh origins so in po uh so no sonic
points but what we are interested in is people so the
question is if someone is moving i'm talking here i stop talking
i'm going here i'm talking how to detect that it's the same people if we want to uh integrate information to say
these people has uh spoken seventy percent of the time in the five last minutes obviously we need
to uh to know that it's the same people so right now our practical solution is to have
one uh microphone close to um every place where people are supposed to sit
so we can infer that if a sound is coming in this area it's the same so kind of trick but for
the beginning it's enough

and a last question that is related t uh our last if i not find another one um
about people if someone is leaving or if someone uh maybe it would be
something ev uh quite complex even for you if someone is staying here but
is quiet or leaving how can we detect that someone is here but quiet okay
i know but how to integrate the information uh
not not yet maybe later on but
oh the wait and the sit
or putting his bag on the okay but it was just to it's a question i'm not sure we will talk too much about that today

uh not directly but it's uh related
so in a couple of days we will get this um uh the fire wire uh box
so we will we have chosen one that has eight uh line up so we'll be able to
have line in sorry so we will be able to plug uh up
to eight uh microphones with uh jack plugs to exhale air with the possibility
of extending with eight more x l r  uh microphone with another box
so we ha we have the computer we have the the main box with the eight line ins and it's fire wire
it is optic
to have eight more x l r  if we need it but we are not sure to to buy it now but we can extend it
that's uh
yes well
we are not sure about what kind of microphone we should use so we wanted to uh that's
a first thing so we wanted to have open possibilities and secondly maybe we will use this box you know to
get uh data i don't know if in another experiment maybe in another project if we want to
have comments of different people around the table or o elsewhere uh getting uh having the possibility
of using x l r  microphone could be uh uh could be neat so everything is open
no we are not very interested in
more than one
mm mm mm mm
okay
they won't have nice light uh lighting on in front of them
they would maybe careful
but
okay
so maybe w uh you could present a different work uh you have done and uh i don't know how they are
so you told us it was different pieces more than one integrated device
oh uh
what would be the d difference between detecting the average or detecting the maximum
what what would be the difference what is the difference
it's a kind of filtering already
sixty okay
again
uh huh
okay
so it's thirty two millisecond frames taken each
an idea so something like that so why are you overlapping
i have a rough idea but uh what is the main interest
mm hmm
yeah and it's kind of crappy
precise okay okay
mm mm mm so you use the first and last point to detect what is between
mm hmm
mm mm
okay
so you are
mm hmm
mm hmm
corresponding to breath or a little noise
'kay
but you're talking about the microphone array here
strong background noise
so phase
uh huh
uh huh
okay
so the phase the time between uh audio signals for um for this microphone on this microph
okay
okay
mm hmm
mm hmm
and do you get something about the um distance of the guy that is talking or just a direction
okay
mm mm
mm hmm
okay
you mean that each person will have a specific frequency because i the way he's talking or his localization
it's a kind of uh speaking styles both
i don't really get your last uh diagram yes so it's at one given moment still
okay so you can say that f this frequency belongs more to this person and this one more to this
one but some frequency may maybe are not used neither by uh guy the guy
one or the guy two
okay maybe they are using the same frequency so you need to s
okay
okay
okay
and can you detect if someone is laughing or angry d uh there is kind of signature uh even if we can't really trust it uh uh s one hundred percent of the time uh
and do processing on it
okay
pitch
it is pitch
li okay
what is a excuse me
uh huh okay
okay so where are you represent the phase
okay
uh huh uh huh
okay
mm hmm
mm hmm

mm mm mm
because if we are distributing the microphone all around the table then we come back to the energy solution is it what you say
with the energy dissolution or with uh f f t  too
okay
but there are many many things
the difference between the
mm hmm
mm mm yeah
what would be the difference you will not compare each mic with uh all the other one but just comparing this one with the
mm okay okay but what are uh uh so what are this mic for instance the electret mic omni directional electret
okay

yes
and when you were talking about comparing energy in the case where a microphone would be distributed all around the table uh you're comparing energy and the time delay
because time delay is is too short to be compared or can be neglected
okay
okay okay yeah
it's time cool
okay
mm hmm
okay
okay
mm hmm
okay
okay
yeah
okay
yeah
okay
mm hmm
okay
mm hmm
okay
ok okay
mm hmm
mm
so do you know uh which way you give the feedback light or i saw something like that
okay
hmm
hmm
mm hmm
mm
okay
okay
yeah
maybe more complex yeah yeah
so th
hmm but yeah
to the border basically some distance or
okay o okay
obviously yeah
okay
okay
hmm
yeah
yeah
okay
right
hmm
mm
okay
mm hmm
okay
but don't yeah don't you think with a beam also you have less problems with the sheets or you don't want to do that
yeah
okay
confusing yeah hmm
okay no it's a choice yeah
okay
mm hmm
yeah
mm hmm
okay
yep
okay
yeah
but physically it's just uh something flat on the table again yeah
okay
okay
yeah
okay
hmm
okay
yeah so it's different but still uh yeah it's same
okay
okay
yeah
okay
yeah
mm hmm
okay
mm hmm
okay
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah yeah
hmm
right
hmm
okay
right
mm hmm
mm hmm
or too long oh just kidding
okay
yeah
yeah
right
mm hmm
yeah
ah so you ha you you might have multiple colours or yeah sorry didn't get that
yeah yeah
alright
okay
yeah
mm hmm
right
mm hmm
okay
mm hmm
okay
hmm
no it's quite clear
so uh i guess you want to know what you could do with an array maybe
mm hmm
yeah
or yeah yeah yeah it's good idea just give some questions uh
mm hmm
right
mm hmm
mm
mm hmm
okay
mm hmm
yeah
mm hmm
you mean the top of the wave form okay
yeah
oh
okay
hmm
hmm
mm hmm
okay
yeah
yeah
hmm
okay
mm hmm
yeah
yeah yeah okay separation uh
yeah
hmm
mm hmm
well you need a camera obviously i mean will you have a camera
maybe you can detect breathing
yeah yeah that you could do or on the table uh there should be well
okay uh
okay
mm
well
okay
mm hmm
okay
so you i think guillaume said that's optic something like that or
okay so you you need a different you need a microphone with um a device inside right
ho how does it work
okay
yeah
okay
mm
hmm
it's another fire wire or not fire wire but um
okay
but concretely you would use that to get higher quality signals
y that's all
yeah
ah okay okay
yeah
yeah
hmm
okay
and how
hmm
hmm you mean you meant eight kilo uh sampling frequency
yeah
uh we use sixteen so that's eight kilo band width
sixteen kilo uh sampling frequency it it's not bad uh it's quite decent
um
mm f before answering the questions uh th there's also a point of uh precision of localization if you use an array so if you use higher frequencies you can get more precise localization but maybe you don't need it
uh that i can't answer directly
uh it depends on your set up you know um you have to test basically
um
y you get uh the angle the most precise one is the asymmet in the horizontal plane then you also get elevation but it's not very precise it's more of an indication and radius is very bad
if you use a planar geometry like this one
yeah um you can use multiple ones and do some um um triangulation
eight eight these are only screws microphones are on bottom yeah yeah
mm hmm

a cube okay
yeah then you might get uh better direction in elevation but i'm not sure it's really relevant um no so
uh if people move forward yeah
ah the radius th then the r the problem is not the geometry it's the um i you need more than one basically
with one you will only get direction
microphone array so
mm
direction yeah
um
yeah
it's a different option yeah um we haven't tried that because
we are not going to have the special kind of table more uh this is not a good example but we have like
a box just bring the box and put it so it uh we could not consider
that but in your case it could be interesting yeah unless people put something on the microphone
but um
yeah
right but that i'm i think after the meeting we can go and talk to olivier about that i'm not the person for hardware
yeah
yeah i'll t i'll try to present uh i guess it corresponds to your questions

yeah
so the the lowest layer would be the first two questions um you asked about how to detect um activity currently you're thresholding the t maximum of your wave form right
ah ah okay and you're looking for a peak
yeah
yeah
yeah
hmm
okay
uh
yeah yeah and your second question uh was about f f t  what can be done with
f f t  so um the approach we're taking here
is to answer both questions the same time we use f f t  to do detection
we don't use the wave form the raw wave form so um
we split um we split the signal in small frames like sixteen millisecond sixteen
um each frame is taking thirty two millisecond of signal just to give an idea and there is a one frame every sixteen millisecond and they overlap of fifty percent
um
yeah each sixteen millisecond
well th these are details it's just to give an idea um
well it's uh the the c
because usually when you do f f t  y if i'm getting into details but you you apply um
a window to avoid effect so the beginning and the end it
it i it's not crappy it's just not very much rep represented because you apply um
a window which has this shape having window so they're very yeah
no i'm saying uh when you take your signal you take one frame you apply the window uh
and the window is simply uh coefficients you give and you give higher coefficient to the middle
than to the extreme so if you don't do overlap y
you will lose information at the beginning and the end
okay but you don't have to do overlap i mean uh it's um
hmm
um c m u  no is it from c m u  um uh yeah
yeah yeah
right
yeah yeah
yeah
f f t  is only a tool uh um uh what we do release a phase domain analysis we only use the phase between the microphones um
yeah but also for detection
yeah um we have a way so um
i don't think i should get into details but basically the beginning is your signal which you slice into frame you
do f f t  on each mic and the end is um a number
of uh frequency beams which are used by each person
to uh explain roughly s so when you speak speech is wide band
so um the more active you are the more band width you use so
you will get a large value of band width for people who speak and uh for
the others it will random it will be a small value
or just background noise and so uh
yeah 'cause one problem if you use energy based methods which is probably more uh the thing you've been
using so far is that it's not um quite related to location
so you can have um uh for one person you can have uh a
high energy signal which is difficult to locate and visa versa um
i think in your case you're quite interested in the location so i would advise to um
use more uh phase domain methods
um
once you have the fifty for each frequency you have uh the magnitude and the phase so you can compare the phase of the microphones and this is directly linked to the direction of the person
um
sometimes we use it but not it's not the first thing we use i know it's a bit counterintuitive but um maybe i'll go t to the board yeah
okay
r right for a single channel it's not very meaningful but here it's relative phase between the microphones so uh i'll just try to um s summarise
no that's what i don't do um this
would be valid for uh like speech recognition with a single channel that would be a very good idea
but if you choose to use multiple channels
um
let's say you have four of them
with f f t  you can just uh as i said l look at the phase between the microphones at a given frequency
um it is linked to this value yeah uh basically the time you're mentioning is this value
and this is the frequency and this is an angle in radians
so uh f f t  gives you a measure of these values
uh this i can point to a paper uh i don't think this is the right place to explain everything but will give you if you look at your table uh what we have developed here
is an approach where um th uh you divide the space in sectors
for example ten sectors around the table
and uh
in each sector you will get the value
no it's uh application dependent for example um
well this is not
and on this one you could have a large value
on on on those ones small values
uh these are number frequencies
which we estimate with several steps from these measures so to conclude
what we are doing is uh we estimate how much of the frequency spectrum you are occupying when you speak
or i am occupying in this direction when i speak and it turns out that um
this is quite good to do uh detection and localization at the same time
bec because you know in a sector space there is uh uh this much activity
yeah yeah um
more recently um i've worked on uh
um prolongating this with a more precise direction evaluation
to know where in the sector the person is so that uh that's not much work
once you have done this this is can be this can be done quite quickly
then you
yeah y well i i use a value but then you'll get two large values yeah so
no just direction yeah
well f yeah i it's not uh i it's an inherent problem to
the geometry you use you can for example if you use another array
uh you can intersect lines of direction
uh
mm maybe uh uh i w mm
i wouldn't trust it too much classically what you do is you extract the signal
of the person um one interesting thing is that these numbers are not uh arbitrary
things they represent the number frequencies where a given person is dominant
but when you have two of them which might be interesting for separation you know already when you have done this processing
uh w which part of the frequencies of the spectrum um belongs to this person and to that person
and then it's easy to separate the signals
um both
it's it's more an instantaneous um this is still instantaneous this is for one time frame
if you look at all your frequencies for example uh zero to four kilohertz
um
you can split it and say uh all these parts belong to person one here
and uh all the other parts belong to the other person
that's correct but then uh you can look statistically it wi it will be negligible um because the r of uh of the difference level
yeah it's uh you can listen to it yeah and then you can do some uh maybe higher level um analysis where you get the pitch of the person or
this
yeah yeah and this is
exactly
yeah
then it's uh random and that's why you get these values uh which are random
yeah yeah but this is very rare and when it happens one is always masking the other in practice so um
yeah
no no but uh i've i've seen quite a few papers i i've n not done it myself i'm really on the lowest level um but uh once you have done this as i said
you can uh separate the signals
and um
do do processing uh
so uh you can get pitch rate of speech that's quite easy pitch um
the uh uh timbre en francais um so uh for
different person this might be quite different at least for male females
and uh rate of speech like if somebody is talking very uh in a very energetic manner it might be quite fast uh or just energy also one
yeah also um that might be an issue with people are bringing laptops um
they will b yeah they might be detected as another another source uh
so you would have to uh classify the sources as human or machine
but again yeah i think once you see the spectrum if it's just pure and stable
uh
also yeah if if there's no pitch
so uh
yeah
yeah
so all will go and be detected there
yeah so w what you're mentioning is a pain for us but for you it might
be 'cause we're only interesting in getting the speech but for you it might be quite uh quite
good yeah so i've to avoid uh filtering and smoothing
'cause as soon as you do that um you exclude some of the information so it's
better to keep it for the latest stage so um um
on top of this there's another part uh which is more linked to the tracking
all this was for one time frame
so um
yeah you can play with it um in speech it's uh stationary
over ten twenty millisecond and we make a stationary assumption a local stationary t  assumption
um which allows you to use f f t  and blah blah blah uh
now in spite of that i know some people use much longer windows which is not a problem but
uh it's a bit too much i think
uh like some very small words like yes they might be two hundred millisecond
or three hundred millisecond
um
yeah they might be blurred with uh silence
so yes you you might have to play with it just to save processing time like use slightly longer frames
yeah at m at most yeah
um
simply because i've used one hundred as a minimum length of a speech word yeah so
um
now assuming you have done this for each time
i if this is your detail or i should use a different
um
if this is your asymmet at each time you get a direction so asymmet is your direction in horizontal plane it's an angle like north south east west and
yeah no no of this is uh really different i'm just saying
that uh once you have done this for a given time frame you can have a direction of the person
at least in terms of sector and it's also possible to give a more precise direction
quite quickly
so uh this was kind of the lowest layer
now this is a layer just above it which might interest you um if you repeat that over time
you will see patterns um
for example uh at two different locations
two different person will speak so you can cluster those
and you will see that uh if it's long enough it's some significant event um this can be done quite cheaply yeah
yeah
yeah
a cost
yeah th
um well i use matlab so it's not perfect it's like three four
yeah but not everything is uh um simple linear especially this part it's definitely not linear because you're looking at a maximum energy in a frequency kind of
the most expensive part is here with matlab i have three four times real time
um you can do sub optimal processing and uh
for example here i'm considering all possible pairs of microphones uh which is twenty
eight and the processing is directly um r
proportional to that so um you can save
on that
but then you lose a little bit on precision also i i'm using all the small frames with fifty percent overlap i don't think you really need absolutely to do that
it's not that good in terms of uh direction
um
yeah i would be careful with that like five six is uh decent
uh six i would say yeah
eight yeah uh i get down now to one two degrees uh root mean square error
uh so you might not need that that's what i mean might not be
um
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah yeah so it could be sufficient to uh yeah define enough sectors and
no no so it's arbitrary i use twenty degree sectors uh 'cause i had to choose a value but it's up to you um
yeah yeah
um
so that's another way yeah it it's almost like having a lapel yeah um
yeah
i think it's not necessarily a bad idea actually um
well uh
if you are able to calibrate your microphones um the ones who are closer to the person will get more energy
um so you can compare that it's possible so
yeah um
i have experience with that um
on the side i've done some single channel work which can maybe help
um 'cause uh it seems to me that you are not definite on the geometry right
yeah
um m this part is quite specific to a microphone array where like they are concentrated in uh some place like in the middle of the table
yeah
yeah yeah but you can kind of come back to that also um
uh f f t  also yeah yeah
r right yeah yeah it has to be as good as possible
yeah
yeah true
yeah
we can also consider directional microphones you know no um
so you can uh their pattern is uh not uh the same
uh depending on the direction where the person is so for example if there was a directional microphone pointing
there you would get most of my energy but less from you et cetera
you can also do microphone arrays with directional microphones uh
um might not be relevant but um
uh
more or less it's it depends on what you want i mean uh i don't know yeah
they're o yeah omni directional yeah
m uh i guess so
it's the same yeah exactly the same yeah yeah yeah yeah quite expensive
yeah they are um high quality mics
uh i think we can leave this question for olivier
yeah
no no y you would uh assume
uh you would neglect it the time delay is is very small it it's only used for uh
getting the a direction when you have a microphone array but in that case it's not relevant
um you would assume that they are roughly synchronised not necessarily very precisely
and um compare the energy levels but i have no experience with that
um
now i don't know you don't want to use ah it's almost okay
yes
uh dave cochrane
user interface defin designer yes
um

um the monkey um the one f uh in fact this is a somewhat
oblique reference in fact to uh well my i have a three uh three y year old daughter who h who who who is affectionately
known as miss monkey um monkeys have attitude which i think is a good thing and
i mean fr and from uh from the point of view of sort of the study of human evolution they and other primates are terribly
interesting um so i like monkeys and
and th th th th thi thi this one seems to have perhaps more attitude than most
well one thing i'm aware of is th there uh um at the sort of v very high price
end of the market there's there's a em emerging market for sort of touch screen l c d  remotes
that can be uh programmed in m much more sophisticated ways than sort of conventional models so you get the sort
of you get um you you can redesign the interface to your own needs
you can programme in macros and you get a much greater degree um um i mean you get in these sort of
three in one five in one whatevers but you can get integration between the different uh the the the diff
the different things that it's designed to control to a much greater extent and you can have one uh you know one macro to
turn the uh you know turn the t v  to the right channel get the uh re uh rewind the tape in
the v c r  and get it to play once it's rewound for instance um
b it occurs to me there might be a niche for uh for a remote that
aimed towards some of that sort of functionality but using a just conventional push button design
and therefore putting it into a um well much lower price bracket
absolutely prohibitive yeah
yeah i mean i wouldn't like to say you g i mean you get ones that you can switch between multiple units but something that could um
operate between multiple units in a more integrated fashion some and ideally something into which
it would have some at least limited facility for um running macros
for instance um let's say oh oh um
or um you know you pr uh you press uh say the play button for the d v d  player
and it turns the t v  on and onto the right channel as well um
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm the other key feature that uh that would be a good idea built into it is
t is is to make something you know fairly sort of ergonomic something that just fits fits as comfortably
as possible into the hand but of course uh al al also allows for the
possibility of a more sort of
slightly unconventional or attractive uh
sha shape for it overall
a curve mm hmm something sort of sort of sl slightly sort of biomorphic in form uh which it would need to be to sort of conform to the shape of the hand more efficiently anyway
okay well i think we're ready to begin right my name's adam duguid we're here because of real reaction um we have in the group
um yeah go for it mate
n  e  z  ebenezer and your role is
you're the marketing expert okay
next we have
t  r  i  k  and your role in this is
industrial designer
and lastly we have
and you're going to be the user interface is it designer okay
right this is the agenda for today's meeting as you can see w opening acquaintance tool training project plan discussion
and closing um we already got n through opening and partially through acquaintance
so the reason we're here we're gonna design a new remote control as you probably all know the very
broad overview is original trendy and user friendly course we'll have to go into a bit more um detail than
that but uh personally i think that the original is gonna be a very key aspect
to this design um there's a lot of remote controls out there anyway so we're gonna need something that's really gonna set it apart
this is how today seems to be going to work we're gonna have the three kay phases as you've probably already been told the functional architectural and the detailed design um
first one's gonna be covering the user requirement spec technical functions working design second seems to be conceptual
components properties materials and the last one is a detailed analysis of our design so
far of course you've all got the similar emails i believe right
what can i say ebenezer you wanna have a you wanna draw your favourite animal

brilliantly done thank you tarik would you like to have a shot at a bit of artistry
oh um you can clip them to your belt
you should also l um have your the lapel mic on as well
yep the it's just across there that's it
yep
yeah it'll follow you if you
you can probably just stick it in your pocket for now i wouldn't worry too much should have good range

excellent thank you very much dave if you'd like to uh
have a dash
cheers
hardly what i'd call the best drawing in the world but it'll do for now also not quite as feared as your average tiger but uh
cats are one of my favourite animals they're very independent they're snotty as hell at the best of times
and uh what can you say you got to love those qualities in an animal
right i think we've all managed to master the whiteboard there by looks of it so on to it
project finance as you can see twelve point five euros per unit
that's not a terrible lot as far as i'm aware and we're hoping to sell them for twenty five
if we're aiming for fifty million euros we're gonna have to be selling an awful lot of them
yep well fifty million and if you're making twelve point five euros on each one then awful lot need to be sold
okay now we better actually just get on with the uh the meat of the project so i'm gonna guess that we've all used remote controls
any ideas of where you think a new remote control could go into this market
okay
okay yeah tha that's true with the price range we're looking at going for a touch screen would probably be possibly out of our yeah but you think uh again something to control multiple units in uh a simple fashion
would the the idea something along the lines of one on button would turn on say the video recorder the t v  maybe the sound system as well all in one go is that kind of
okay that sounds like a a good strong idea um
any takes on this
okay
okay
yeah i've heard i've seen the bar code design before yeah

okay well we're beginning to run out of time now so we've got a couple of ideas we can we'll have to work
fast um alright as you can see we've got thirty minutes until the next meeting so
we'll have to try and decide on some of the basic functionality um how the user interface might work that'll be
a key aspect especially if the idea of um some kind of macros facility because you have to program
it you have to have a lot of response back or at least some kind um
and we're gonna maybe n try and have to figure out
what the user wants yes um right has anybody got anything they'd like to add at this stage anything they think that might have been missed so far
i i don't see why not almost everybody is probably used to a console by now and all of them incorporate small keypads on them in fact even the mobile phones these days are beginning to use them as well so it's probably an interface that most people are used to um
and that could allow n easy navigation used as a joystick as well
okay
so small stylish and something that's just a little different
okay that's definitely something that we should be able to do quite easily
i would i would have hoped so anyway um right
i'd say we finish this one up we get started i'll get in i'll write up what we've um kind of quickly done and i'll get that out to everybody
yeah okay

um as far as i'm aware we leave the microphones here um unless we get told otherwise and just take the laptops with us
oh ebenezer ademesoye would you like me to spell that
s
um n e z 
e r 
i'm the marketing expert
sure

whiteboard 'kay
s okay i will make this quick since we don't have much time
um

'kay so it's not the best picture in the world
here we have an elephant
first point begins with an e  same like ebenezer also elephants have a very good memory much like myself and i can't remember back when i used to live back in nigeria but i think i used to have a pet elephant
so elephants are big strong and gentle and they have great memories and they begin with the letter e  just like ebenezer
thank you
oh oh oh i think you ga
the little
the the
oh that's good we can clip them on okay yeah there was this microphone as well that you
just um somewhere
i think so
yeah there you go

oh that was profiting that was an amount so that's the amount made okay
yeah
oh
'kay
well um i've noticed that uh gaming c is becoming quite popular with television
um when i was younger we used to e play games using our cable using the cable subscribed
the cable providers but our remote controls would get worn out really easily and
the remote control was not a great kind of keyboar um keypad for playing games so perhaps one that was
more um
specialised for game playing or interactive television they they've recently brought out this new remote control
for people to set their favourite channels or um to record things instead of people entering
in what time things start you simply stri slide a bar to say what time it begins and slide
another bar to say what time it ends you know that's
yeah it's it's taken out the
y you don't have to be uh really clever to use a remote control i think for gaming you know you want you want some big buttons for up down left and right shoot

uh you wanna be able to change angles in interactive television so you need buttons to change the television angle the camera angles and stuff like that
yeah
what the user wants uh
okay
oh okay
mm hmm
'kay so
tarik rahman t a r i k 
industrial designer


do we take them off oh right okay
ah ha

now where do i put the
is this supposed to be clipped as well

uh destroying your elephant here



uh here we have a tiger uh
i've always loved tigers they're just they're big they're biggest cats uh i did a project on cats in the wild when i was a kid
and uh it was my favourite cat just 'cause it was looks the best the stripes orange my dad used
to talk about he's from bangladesh so he used to tell me all about them when he was when i was a kid and uh they're just
the most feared of of uh animals in the wild so uh that's why i like them
didn't say an anything about me really but

mm
'kay
well when you're talking about gaming and stuff do you think they should have some sort of
stick on it rather than buttons
like uh control pads you know of games but or is that a bit ridiculous
yeah
no
yep
uh you can be sitting here itself and do the presentation
now you need the different method from how from gammas you can generate the posteriors
okay


uh i was just um let's talk about little about this presentation itself the slide number six
okay how you feel it is important that you're taking the context of the whole utterance how important it could be is it not a possibility that you're having less context
instead of having context from one to capital d  which is for the whole utterance which doesn't make much sense in general so what is a possibility that you can cut the context instead of having the context from
that's right
might be left or right everything there but not the whole context because it's it's a fact that when you are having
one utterance so it one utterances link up full sentence or something and there might not be much breaks in it
so in that sense it doesn't make sense that you are going too much in the past and then you are trying to compute something which is not related
mm hmm
kind of let's say idea is usually hundred milliseconds or one second
yeah numbers it might be okay because most of the sentences might be three seconds or something
yeah
that m that match of context to computer commas
mm hmm
okay so when we are talking about them then my story they are the worst i think yeah i cannot generate posteriors so there is
i don't have the c  files also presently with me
yeah no my said that enough is enough
yeah and then i then i would have taken two years extension yeah it was it was pretty scary but let's see what happens
icsi mm hmm
because even um petr has lost a lot he's having only the results with him he doesn't have the files the real the real s ones
mm hmm
yeah
yeah because even to download that much of data
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm mm hmm
and then you have to get the l p  p l p  features and
okay because tho those files are also very big they are not single files so there should not be any break
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm mm hmm mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah p l p  numbers ninety five database is there fine
yeah
everything is lost and uh if if you really ask me even the structure which was there real every point by point how p l p  is well generated that information is also not there
yeah but the parameters which are exact
hopefully ninety five percent i know but that five percent
and then we we need to train the new rates because m l p  training needs to be done and then only the next step will happen
so it's it's pretty pretty hol holding is stupid whether we can replicate the results whatever results you are showing whether we can replicate them or not presently it's it's not known
yeah you
mm hmm
mm hmm mm hmm mm hmm
mm hmm
no no no no he is using different setup i think he doesn't use our setup do you use our setup for the number
of states for the gamma estimation okay mm hmm mm hmm no
no those things i'm also having because they were done two years back
anything which is done in the last two years is the one which is
nothing
the there's also in com com database yeah
yeah that's right
no th those things are not disturbed
nothing related to the database has been disturbed
except the switchboard
no they're there
no no it was it was pre written there it's in the database itself
that's right yeah
yeah so it that is not a problem
no i didn't do it myself no no no means at l yeah that part is less uh scary
yeah
so the things which are related to your p l p  can be done i think it's it's not such a major problem
so you tha m l p  needs to be trained and uh p l p  features so it's kind of one and a half days work kind of to generate the new files
yeah that will aga means it'll light up that's it but all all of it is doable in three four days time
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm mm hmm and if i don't have to generate any new results i'm also on the other
side then but if i need to generate new results then and anyway there is emotional
loss so scripts and code everything written that is
no
yeah yeah because it's
yeah yeah
yeah means losses are emotional as well as whatever it is there and bla bla but it's tragedy
so
so raid five you have told to the
mm hmm
no one disk there is no problem
mm hmm okay mm hmm
mm hmm mm hmm mm hmm
mm
mm hmm
was it insured any idea
no no insurance can take care of uh means anything can be insured in this world nowadays
mm hmm
but it still means one thing which is a mystery to me whe why temp one and temp two were residing on the same hard disk physical
mm hmm mm hmm
mm hmm mm hmm
yeah so it means
so that
mm hmm
no no no what i'm saying means temp one and temp two could have been different systems altogether
i'm saying they could have kept differently
no raid on both they systems was the problem
hard disk there there were already five hard disks right
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah not everybody is going to be scared of temps
mm hmm
mm hmm
no no no no no no no no i checked over the net it's not the way you d you send the things to them they will see if they can recover then only they'll ask you that this is the quotation but if there is no no if they cannot recover they they will send it back
mm hmm
no no no first they'll give you a quotation the they won't go we ho without that it's not means it's a wrong information
yeah yeah because in the beginning what they say that send us the thing we'll look at the things if it is recoverable we will tell you what is the quotation and if it is not recoverable we will send it back to you
but means f and uh i if they they cannot recover it then then what they will they won't charge anything from you for the inspection
but
that's right
yeah means looking at uh how much failure has happened accordingly they will tell you whether they can recover or not
yeah
yeah yeah
so how much is four tera four thousand gigabytes
okay
not much
is it raid one has more compared to raid five
no raid one is having exactly f fifty percent capacity is utilised it's copy
two copies of the same thing will be existing that is a raid one
that's right raid five is twenty percent
no so raid one is exactly it's means that's lot of wastage of resources but it's more tolerant
and there is no kind of or anything nothing exists there so the disk which has crashed that cannot be recovered that
uh disk which has not crashed it can be recovered completely
means if both the disk have crashed for the same data you cannot recover anything if one disk has crashed crashed then you can recover everything yeah it'll be in the other disk so that is raid one
if you are given a choice you want to take raid one or raid five or a simple laptop
mm hmm
to what are the experiments you need to do what are the new experiments you are having in your mind
mm hmm mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
but do you feel that is paper material
but the one which you have reported means you want to report something more than that
ah okay mm hmm
okay
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm mm hmm
mm hmm
okay
so might be what i can do i can give you the setup and you can you can generate from bottom train m l p  test m l p 
mm i was using thirty nine yes
mm hmm mm hmm
so what is this result this is related to your um m l m i 
ah okay mm hmm
mm hmm
what is a triphone gammas
ah okay your your m l p 
okay but those gammas will be same as uh s normalised scale likelihoods right then the they're through that data uh from through
okay
uh not uh scale likelihoods
posteriors
from
g m m  oh m l p  scale likelihoods you're you are having posteriors there right
you divided by the okay okay so it's scale likelihoods
okay
and full network what was the r ch architecture
ah okay mm hmm mm hmm
so what are the other things we need to discuss
one day after the crash yeah
mm hmm
that's all be because of you you came on wrong day from iran you should had come on it would have been okay
anyway
uh they'll get a shock of their life
might be the one kind of like if they have read their mails
yeah
yeah
yeah everything is lost yeah

yeah
yeah but it's a major loss no doubt

the data on which we want to run the scripts is not there
if they can yeah if they can give me my c  files then also it's okay
yeah because i don't need to generate features also yeah
yeah it's amazing i n i don't need all my p  files just three of them
yeah
nowadays it's not the case they physically also separate the things

or it's sprinklers
then what if their sprinklers don't work
ah uh huh
yeah
they won't keep it at one place yeah
physically at different places yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah
c d s are not enough that's the problem because one c d  is how much it's not even one g b  so then c d s are not enough
mm hmm
hmm you're talking about datas or you're talking about
okay mm hmm
i don't know no no he wa he was having locked many things in the proper places but in temp he wasn't having lot of important things yeah all the experiments which he was running
mm hmm
uh look what
but what we'll do with the switches
no no no no no okay that way it might be but the situation is that uh he he was generating his own p l p  features from his own scripts he was not using using doctor speech
yeah so he was like uh he was so i'd borrowed few of the things from him the
f f t  routine and uh reading the signal wave form these things i borrowed from him and i changed
and then i put it in my all programmes so
i i kept the backups but those backups are the them's also on temp i didn't
i didn't know that this this way it can crash because i thought maybe i can do a mistake and wipe out the things and
then there is no backup so i cannot blame anybody but i didn't know that the whole backup can itself
crash
yeah
so now in in my life i will never believe anything which is temp whether it is temperature or whether it is temporary
because just few few days back i took a backup of my laptop fearing the same thing but then i didn't realise that i should take a backup of
p l p  is hardly anything yeah

ah
from posteriors to s forced alignment
yeah
yeah yeah mm hmm mm hmm
mm hmm mm hmm mm hmm
mm hmm

three years two to three years yeah
not in all cases that's the problem which people are facing because everything was written then
and there itself means even if the optimisation has been done they did the optimisation there and they they worked on that started
working on that they didn't write it with pen or something on a paper or saying that okay this is the best optimisation
yeah
because if i change my configuration and your results are somewhere else
okay
so how much time we have spent
okay so this is good enough yeah okay thank you
have a good day
okay
okay so should i start
okay so i think it's better to first have a presentation of my work and then we can
discuss uh with this crash in temp in temp uh what we can do
uh for my future to to continue my research because apparently
i i will have serious problems okay so i will start with the presentation of my work
mm
okay i start like this then okay so it's uh my g work
is generally about uh using posteriors in uh speech recognition systems and uh somehow
enhancing the estimation of posteriors getting new posteriors which are havi which are more informative
by somehow integrating some extra knowledge like uh prior knowledge and contextual information
related to the problem and then use this posterior estimation
uh uh method uh for designing hierarchical uh speech recognition system so in this
hierarchical arg architecture i will be able to uh integrate the extra knowledge
at the proper level of hierarchy and i will be al also uh able to uh combine
different kind of uh knowledge or sources uh sources of knowledge i have
uh well as you know uh generally posteriors are estimated
using uh neural networks and more specifically m l p s in a speech recognition system so uh
time limited window of a speech signal is uh represented by some cepstral features which are then processed
by an m l p  and it gives us some evidence as in the form of pos phone posteriors
then we use these phone posteriors as features or as scores for
for either just decoding or d uh uh n d training and inference
training and then decoding uh but we know that uh in this
uh in this case we are not able to integrate contextual information uh uh
line contextual information and we are not able to integrate the prior knowledge we can have about phone use
or about
uh words in the posterior estimation so the main motivation is to see if we can
integrate this kind of extra knowledge in the posterior estimation so what is proposed to solve
this problem is to use a uh what we formally use in h m m  formalism which is called
gamma uh state posterior
uh i uh as a posterior for uh training uh or decoding so
it's uh well as you know it's a state posterior probablility in a h m m  which is
defined as the probability of being in a specific h m m  state at a specific time having the whole observation
sequence and the model so whole observation sequence means having complete contextual information
and the mod uh and the model can encode some kind of prior knowledge for us by means of
uh topological constraints
uh well you know it's uh this gam uh gamma posterior is written in terms
of forward and backward h m m  recursions and actually one way to use this uh
gamma posteriors is uh using these posteriors as some kind of newer scores for
decoding so in this case it will be uh similar to hybrid method
um the the difference is that we do one more step uh maybe
i can explain it better there so we do one more step here and we
uh here by means of another h m m  we introduce some kind of uh prior knowledge and contextual
information we get better evidences than what i we initially had here and then we do
the uh decoding and the and s more informative posteriors
uh uh instead of this one
so we are expecting to uh the system to perform better and more robust to
noisy cases here you see uh some results uh and how
uh how what is the effect of introducing uh reasonable prior knowledge so
different uh rows in this table are showing different level of noise and also clean speech and
different columns are showing different kind of posteriors or gamma posteriors
so uh the the first column is showing the uh our baseline system
which is getting estimate of posteriors out of m l p  uh and then d using these posteriors
for decoding and the other columns are showing the performance of uh different kind of gamma so
uh gamma which is estimated using uh information about minimum duration
of phonemes about
possible transition between phonemes and some kind some uh more prior knowledge
like uh which wo like uh which word is composed of which phonemes and
uh g uh gram grammatical knowledge ab uh about transition between words and things like this
so as you see introducing more reasonable prior knowledge um will h help
to have better performance in almo in almost all the cases
and here i compare the performance of the gamma base system with the standard h m m 
g m m  system which is based on uh doing decoding uh using
uh likelihood as the scores and the difference is that our system use uh is using
posteriors for decoding so as you see s uh it's working uh better than the standard
h m m  g m m  system
and finally the conclusion is uh he here we saw how we can get uh some more informative
posteriors by introducing extra knowledge like prior and contextual information and then using
this uh uh p posterior estimation method to design
hierarchical uh speech recognition system which we're which which the goal is
to have a better more efficient and more robust system
so if you want now we can discuss about um uh the crash
and the loss of data so uh well i lost all the posteriors
i was i uh i used as input uh for my system so the gamma
are somehow estimated or computed on top of posteriors and now i don't have any posterior
and uh probably the scripts generating that posterior so what i can do
okay
okay
okay
gamma full model but uh what about other ones and what about the f posterior because because i i
uh you know i cannot uh stop my resea i i may do something else you know in future with this
uh and well i need posteriors to
yeah
uh no no i don't have them there were all under temp you you we have that because you uh stored them
so
yeah yeah maybe maybe some other m uh p h d  student should be hired to work on you know the generating gamma
six okay
less context what you mean
uh
yes yeah
you mean a smaller context instead of this
mm hmm
mm
yeah yes
yeah
yeah b well even they can have some information which are not so meaningful or uh
which are not related yeah well but then i will have the problem to find
the optimum amount of context how much context should i take
mm hmm
mm
okay
okay yeah that's a good idea that's reasonable
mm


yeah
yeah and and you don't have uh scripts for
ah okay you do you have just your no
and what could happen if you don't even have your
mm
yes
n yeah i uh for c t s  petr uh still i think have he didn't uh lose anything so
ah
okay
mm
mm just uh po uh pi uh posterior estimated using p l p  features for number which i think we can we can rate it
uh p l p  they're also last okay

mm hmm

mm hmm

mm hmm
okay
yes
uh nowadays not that one there is another problem for uh verifying these results because
well for these results you know the the configuration should not well i also
saved the configuration somewhere in the temp so exactly how many stays for decoding and
which kind of language model and things like this i i think i can remember almost all of them
but f it's it's a bit uh uh stressful
yeah but h he doesn't
uh y m yes
lost
mm hmm
okay
yeah so so as the conclusion there is no major problem except regenera yeah which time for i guess mm
mm
mm
mm
yeah yeah
yeah
mm
well i also had the of generated posteriors or gammas or things like this
which i should regenerate i have the uh scripts but uh well it takes time it's c p u  and
regenerating all these things but okay it's okay so there is no major problem except time
deadline of two weeks for icas okay

hmm
hmm
t

ah well i i think w after this meeting we can t we can try together to regenerate
this well uh p l p s i think th they should be first regenerated then posteriors and if
by the end of week we could have posteriors then it's not that difficult i can easily regenerate
the gammas and do all the experiments again maybe it's a
uh mainly th there would be some experiment to check how the system is robust against
these uh tuning factors like uh language mod uh language modelling scaling factor
language scaling factor and inversion penalty this will be the main new issue
and uh well
yeah the new thing in the paper and well some
no in these cases but
well actually actually this w this was not in the paper i put it in the presentation but it's not in the paper
uh the paper was just for clean speech but since i had the results before and i cannot copy
these things because i t uh i talked with herve and he said okay actually the
numbers are not uh very reasonable because they are just thirteen p l p  features
and uh we have to have at least something which is known for people i mean they are expecting something
around ninety eighty seven or uh something like this uh so i anyway i had to re
to redo all the experiments but now it's a little bit more difficult because before i had posteriors
and now we have two more steps p l p s and and and posteriors so
yes thank you very much
thank you very much uh
oh m i wanted i wanted to extend this uh well actually the paper we wanted to write was
uh for icas was something related to multi stream gamma but okay okay uh will i
i will explain so tha my plan was to have two streams and i i i well yeah i
so i i thought that okay i one stream will be p l p  and the other will
be delta p l p s so this was one part of experiment so single stream and then i wanted to
combine deltas with this and have another table so that was why
but actually because you know the numbers and the study is not sh i it's not showing uh strong
results anyway results are not very important but they should be within a range of uh
acceptable numbers so then uh for now i think it's better to instead of doing p l p 
and delta p l p  i can uh have single stream of thirty nine p l p s and then combine
them with traps just to have
yeah thirty nine
yeah yeah yeah yeah
no no it's interspeech the okay these numbers are full p l p  thirty nine okay but just to make things clear in the presentation to show more steps
try yeah
yeah yeah
even
even if you
no

th
yeah it's amazing that everything was under temp
yeah

yeah
yeah sileye will be back and he's not in vacation but he's in italy he flies to senegal directly

mm
mm
and what if we have some day a fire in idiap we will lose all the data
mm i mean but they have well i i think w they can and
yeah they can d you know store it somewhere but you know here we can easily have
a fire because the everything is made of wood i think and it's small and

anyway the good the conclusion is to have a back up and uh and c d  at home
mm
yeah
hmm

mm
hmm
yeah


mm hmm
yeah reverse
okay thank you thank you
you too
yeah


yeah you can go back up to the feature you know up to
mm


mm hmm


mm hmm
yeah you can then you know because if most did it on what numbers and one of couple of c t f  experiments right

no no no no no i uh probably might
uh yeah but the wave file is th that's in the temp only right so so the only thing is that i can recover it back from berkeley
no everything we w if th if they say that we cannot recover it then i can quickly get it back from icsi in a couple of days i can put all the system back here but uh
mm yeah
yeah a lot of time no it i can dow obviously downloading is another thing the only thing is that i have to do
is that they have uh data in uh one particular structure so i have to first of all you know organise
create tar files and then i can get it back here

yeah that i can get all those things all th all those m yeah yeah but the those files can be recovered easily only thing is that uh now if they had to say that we cannot recover it
uh uh one uh one uh day one o one two days like this week i can wait and see if they cannot recover it then i can just get all the data from icsi and put back the c t s  system
no we cannot do
yeah
everything that


one one
no no but they're they're they're down in the database section
yeah except switchboard but the switchboard also we have it but only thing is that we don't have all the data we need yeah
no no it is dead because it was that now
no no it w o ori originally done
no no it is even in d v d  form we have it that the
no except uh except time how much time we want to spend again to get
yeah it's

mm mm hmm they are they're it's it's it looks like if you get three disk gone then it's very difficult
to get it well like fine if it's one disk it's fine because at least one
is having the uh mirror mirror so it will recache on the mirror um but uh if
the three disk are gone it's very difficult
so i don't know how it went like usually while as soon as one disk fails it should be replaced
actually and uh i dunno mayb yeah otherwise it uh it'll
go on destroying other disks so i so the one so they i don't know how it
happen you know such a thing like usually as soon as one fails it actually notifies
the you know the system administrator or makes certain kind of um noise
uh yeah to to make sure that you know it has to be replaced so w uh if it the disk is
not replaced then it w it'll fail it uh then then it uh there's a internal recovery
if it just r replace the disk there it's it it can internally it can quickly recover everything
into that disk uh so so it's like you know if you have a mm mm
uh um if you have
it's kind of like essentially if it is like hundred twenty hundred hundred g b  data space then it essentially
will have a hun two hundred g b  only stu visible data f to you but then it can we as soon as they replace
one of those hard disk i it can it can from the other one it can recover everything on that inter
internally it can do that kind of thing but if the th if the three disks fail then it's it's it's yeah a really
difficult job i don't know how it can be recovered probably the mm one way that they extend
the har the hard disk to the people who are experts and they do like sector by sector block by
block they try to recover but that's it's very expensive uh th simple
yes the simple thing might cost you minimum ten thousand euros fifteen something like that
i don't know whether it was insured i don't think insurance company will give
mm hmm

no it does because it was not temp one temp two but they have the same
mm it has three g b  three disks hard disk category and so you can
go up to fourteen or something like that but it can be on the same yeah
but so it tries to put if you it tries to uh quickly put things uh if this way that so that
and but only thing that only one has the mm um backup keep taking up the backup there
so it puts everything mm quickly it can decide wherever it wants to put so it's faster to do that
way mm
no i think that uh soft name they were given the
yeah but then what are the use of raid then
no but that is what the raid can allow you to have keep up to fourteen hard disk
it can allow
yeah so it they have five and you can go up to fourteen if you want to keep there and
it can still work and it takes the and the way it look like it it's still tolerant you know
the way it it usually it does it if you one this crashes before uh i uh
um if it uh replace quickly then no problems otherwise unsaved data will start
the first thing is to get lo lost
mm that's the thing
i um
temp is no well it's a i think they can they can they can do because th th some some of these people that expert there are couple of experts so they learned itself so
if they can easily recover it well
to do this kind of thing you know
yeah it depends on the job you know sometimes the small hardware thing they might do it to then you know five thousand
euros and all but if it's very much detailed work they will just i it the system
the the whole thing starts like this that you have to give your credit card number and sign a form
and then only they will start touching your hard disk
yeah
no no bu no th they will
no no that's what they say like you do it then send it the hard disk then they will say okay we can do it and then if you do it with only with only yeah mm hmm
yeah
yeah
yeah
then what did they estimate of that
yeah
i think that is yeah
no it it is up to you know
and in fact if they they can go a lot but you know they can go block by block and look into it and try to recover but um that matthew will want to go or not is the question
yeah
and it's like forty tera four tera that's forty tera
yeah
four thousand g b s
yeah that's a that's a big
mm um
yeah uh
mm yeah it's a
and hemant how uh how do you want to go about it
mm no i will say how do you like to go about with icas
mm
you did it on only one
and they were then
yeah
he use the triphone m l p  and get uh
no no i i gave yeah
yeah it yeah no no

uh yeah scale like uh scale likelihoo from uh t uh m l p 
yeah well yeah so i j i d do i did try it yeah th that's how you do that
no but i think what i think there is still some data which is recoverable at least they could give us time to i think that uh the most of those things should be there i can hope it already if they could
no you don't have to write but you could read no

yeah

so daniel is well in italy
yeah

oh that is fire will lose all the data you know
physically uh yeah
yeah physically it is updated
no i think there is sprinkler or something around here i hope so
yeah in fact they distributed the whole thing around they may not have it in one place
hmm
yeah
yeah something like that i can recover
no but
for example f phonebook i can recover everything on phonebook because i have it on the c d 
i wrote it once time to copy it to my home and so i have all the data of my c d  but i don't know if
i had i copied all the numbers that are on that so
data itself the whole feature to everything features segmentation every label file everything is there i could recover it back from there actually but
temp
no
no i uh
not

only good thing is that the numbers i think i pretty much can recover all the even the f triphone experiments
because i think i have kept those labels all those things in the speech directory a p  file of it
so it's easier to it all back all those labels and everything yeah
p l p  should be there i re should have kept the p l p  also somewhere tha
n mm the the extra work on is like you know converting the segmentations from monophone to triphone this kind of thing then the all the scripts are there in the temp file that kind of thing
i uh like no no no no no no what you do is
like you have the segmentation to train that for monophones right you can uh you can convert the same thing into
triphone segmentation because there is monophone and triphone they are not different except that you're just going to give a different label to
them p depending on the context so it's easier to convert that segmentation directly here rather than
now ugh you know you say the point that if you lose one uh so uh so
the thing is that i have to recover means i have to recover through the pho no monophone segment
segmentation to triphone segmentation the whole thing
yeah it's okay th that uh numbers it's very fast so it's no problem
yeah so it's yeah yeah but right now you the thing is that right now you know almost what is the uh like the which will give you the best is also you can cont instead of running it hmm
yeah


anyway mm let's recover it ho let's hope the best i think i think we have spent
uh yeah okay fine okay fine
it's all we have to leave fast
a lapel is also there
okay

yeah
yeah
yeah that's better
uh you go to the table you have there like the big table you told and then we can discuss
so which i think i have all the gammas no especially gamma full models i have
yeah posteriors

and posteriors even you have those three state perform gammas also you have all these
huh
ah okay
so now yeah now you can write another paper if you can
gammas to posterior


i two hundred
two hundred millisecond
so but for numbers i think it may be okay numbers hardly yeah one two
even less than that yeah just few words like so but if for or something like if it's really long sentence of ten seconds or something you may not really need so much con
i know it's really computationally very intensive also like if you use
so pretty much all the posteriors are from you only
sk
oh you know
but al for your case you don't need really complicated posterior you just need some p l p s and then

no but but ma he's he may be linking to matthew i guess because matthew got the wav files
but you got the all the wav files so
yeah so that's what i'm saying like
uh yeah yeah yeah so if he got features then it's okay otherwise if he has to generate again he can't generate
yeah
so
because
yeah
but the p everybody has features in temp only most of the time all the c t s  features or c t s  wav files so so forget about c t s  at least now i think because it's again
it takes at least one or two weeks
but segmentation
but you say do you need to do some segmentation also on top of that so
they're
yeah the we can wait at least one or two weeks for this because it's
but still i think we can't really do these things before icas because yeah so maybe we can concentrate work especially on numbers now and then we can go to c t s  so in numbers case what do you really need like
yeah basically yeah w we need to generate again p l p s but wave files are there
yeah p l p s

but you're generating p l p s from um
mm but at least you f
yeah
yeah that you can del
but at least yeah you have something to verify their wa so so p l p s or these are all thirteen just only p l p s not deltas and del
yeah
but if you got something from hemant or matthew then i have those number of stage like we have then you know like it's only for only close uh d c l  k c l  they have
no he he got from you only
ah i think so yeah so then i have those number of stages yeah
ah okay so
ah so you didn't have any p  for these p l p s no p l p s or p  files from p l p 
so bu what about this noise levels like we have noise wav files in da da com databases so we have directly f wave files with uh particular noise ah ok see
no but but i think uh de
but
hmm but the problem is like all this i think it may not be there in database i guess
oh okay you called the noise x  database
ah okay
even with uh s  and r s ah okay then it's okay ah
so y you it's not that you all the no yeah with s  and r  different s  and r s
yeah so at least we have wave files so now we can generate anything in the p l p s or so at least
yeah
those
but for all these s  and r s so that's also again
hmm


no the thing is like you can't really write this k i suppose uh the code is the real problem scripts is okay like yeah even scripts also the configurations or you do if you forget something some factor or something it's really
which disk
uh three disk
mm hmm
so it should be replaced by
ah ok
mm hmm
yeah
hmm
it will ri
uh it will have measures like
uh
hmm but like this
but even this maybe really huge data also
i think maybe some companies definitely do insure you can't really have so many backups
which just partition these uh
hmm
but
yeah
but uh we we
hmm
yeah no temp
uh so then then
hmm
but is it really costly the system is
hmm
maybe at least they will give some number others like they can

hmm
yeah
yeah at least they they will know m beforehand i think uh
yeah yeah
mm but even like how much important data l sometimes it's just m p  threes or something so you don't really need to
fo four tera no
four tera it's like
mm hmm
yeah four thousand gigabytes
yeah it
but now we got something like uh more than fift
no raid five is better i think it l it levels
uh ah okay
mm hmm
but raid five is then then twenty percent copy only ah it's not the other way hmm
mm hmm
hmm yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah it will be then the other disk

yeah
yeah
again
scaling
and also maybe like this noise is he was
mm this is not in the paper actually d
this is
hmm
yeah
at least now he can know a full system setup from
yeah
so now mainly like uh thirty nine p l p  you were always thirty nine no not sure but then why did this features you gave me like they're thirteen you truncated them to
no no no no these these these ones like the
ah okay hmm
ah ah okay
deltas ah okay ah ok
hmm
yeah those results only you reported in interspeech no like uh thirty nine p l p  results uh uh they were but they were less than ten percent or so now even the clean speech you are getting
no no this is just
uh n no he gave scale to me then i generated gammas even uh
no no no no the they're differently yeah yeah because i have triphone g m  g m m s and h m m s so he gave me scale likelihoods of triphones
scale likelihood scale likelihoods from triphone memory
hmm so then again i will pass through full network then i can generate triphone gammas
it's like it's no no it's uh it's just g m m  word models you have all the connections to between all the words like hmm
so then first thing is like we need to generate p l p s and then
all these s  and r s p l p s
hmm
no it was there on uh like uh yesterday morning also like even so i was running some experiments and then it was okay but it's readable only so i can't write anything so
yeah so but we don't know like we thought like i thought it's recovering so maybe by tomorrow i'll get everything so uh so if you want a copy again you'll have
but yeah still some people are in vacation so they will really
pedro pedro also
hmm but even all over the recent iteration iterate training set in temp because like
we we s how much we can copy because it's really so many iterations and even we thought of really
completing minimal experiment also mm
but at least yeah a script are there every scripts like at least scripts are there but so if if they can decode
yeah if they can decode at least hemant's p  files then hemant can
yeah but c  files yeah even if they give you p  files it's really better even you don't really need to ru run all the

yeah yeah you j just only like recent p  files at least
no no no
yeah
but still i think i it depends
uh in edinburgh they had that big fire and then
even even sa several uh da buildings and all the computers in that building they all burned but they
have like three backups in the university so all these people they didn't really affect much
no it's the university is maybe it's really big so they can afford for
yeah they yeah yeah they want th they'll have backup in different and also in in some in underground so that like file proof or something yeah
yeah maybe
no c d s are not enough like no yeah how much uh
hmm

hmm

but what about home directories or he also kept everything in uh temp
yeah
but he he did mostly on numbers no so at least if we can recover we we can read some of his stuff or something did you locate it it is home or home speech or something
look for any features or anything are there
no no he he maybe he might be using same p l p  features or something it they are different
we don't know it
uh his own
ah okay is here he got uh his own
yeah
uh
hey
hmm
oh then it's good you know like we don't really nee
so but your p l p  is also like
mm hmm
then we just need to run your neural net only yeah but p  p  p l p s are like hardly few minutes li
mm
which which scripts
and then
but but you still need to run all the nets no l
it's
no but it's it's not i think at least it takes two hours or three hours i think you can't parallel also that's the problem
he
yeah
yeah
yeah so for example if he want repeated all these results then he ju he need to use all ma hemant's p l p  configuration then that's really
yeah the results will be
then you don't you don't know uh uh well
yeah for thirty five forty minutes it is uh uh thank you
it's all
okay so welcome back what do do we have to do

so first i want to say i'm the secretary so i make the minutes you find them in your in the map in the
from the group there's the minutes from the first meeting you'll find the next minutes also there
then
i wanna hear from you what you've done
and after that i have some new product requirements so and after that
we have to make decisions what we will do and then we're ready we have forty minutes
for this meeting after that we'll have lunch so first
i wanna ask the
industrial designer to tell what he did so
yeah on your computer or the
what's the name
what's the name of it
it's the technical function or the functional requirements

working design
working design what is this product documents
on the desktop
up
up
up up
up yes my documents
nope
gone well you um nah nah nah nah
powerpoint working design
and
presentation
of working design
save as
uh it's
project
save
very good
okay
so
now have ten minutes to tell it
okay

oh oh two questions the battery you say one battery is cheaper why
yeah but when you use two you can use it two times longer
okay so it's the size of the remote control okay and the buttons when you use it on the television you've you need the television wh which can use it
s
okay
i think we have to use it also on other televisions though
so
yeah but i don't i think it they are two different things though we have to choose one
it has to work on o uh all televisions
okay
yeah good idea
mm hmm
yeah but there are much more nokia telephones than um these ones

yeah but are their
profits bigger than their cost
yeah but there are also design cost
i don't think when you have a remote control do you change the cover
would you change the cover
no
n yeah but
i think that too less people would change it for good profit so

yes it is but i don't think we have to do it
okay

that's clear okay thank you so now the user interface designer
we'll got back on that later
'kay thank you
then it's your turn the marketing expert

okay thank you yes
i think uh the l c d  is cheaper than speech recognition so i think that can be an d good option l c d 
yes only the l c d 
so but we'll come back on that
now
oh go on
what d d d um
um
uh we go back on the decisions later now we have a few new product requirements
first teletext we have internet now so we don't need the teletext anymore
so
not necessary next
only for the television so we don't look at the other things like the radio or something only the television third
we look at the age group of forty plus uh no younger than forty is a g big group and like you showed n not very much people buy our stuff
fourth point
our corporate colour and slogan must be used very important for the design so you can see it on our site
next
um no
we have to make our decisions what we want to do so like
you said we need the maybe it's good to put it in a document
now we have to decide what controls do we need so maybe you can tell us
sorry
yes
yes it's okay
yeah but we don't use it it's a new requirement so it's not my requirement
we have to do this
no
so
what controls do we need
who first
okay
uh power
uh mm channel
channel
zero to nine
volume
maybe it's easy to pick what was w your one
techno
okay
we had w uh no no no no
where was that example of the
johan that was the the the the the technical
hallo
okay what do we need
on off zero to nine
yeah that's the channel
menu uh yes the n newer televisions ha do have menus
uh
m menu i think um
the
only one or
two numbers
and
hello
that's ch

yes
on the l c d  screen
you mean
think it's better to have it on the remote control 'cause it it has to work on all televisions
so
we need
n yes but if we
have this
so now we don't have a lot of buttons
is this enough
mute
maybe in the menu
mute mm hmm okay
maybe more

no
well then that's all this will be the buttons
and
i think that's enough for the next phase so we can go on to
yes
no that's for the next phase um
phase two is the conceptual design so then we'll have the concepts
that's for the so uh next point
now we have lunch break
after that we have t thirty minutes for work and you can find the minutes in the project documents folder inclusive the uh buttons no
your individual action you can find them in the email
so now it's time for lunch
thanks for coming

mm hmm
mm
yeah it's a good idea but
if if it yeah i don't i'm not sure if it will make profit enough to uh but it's uh yeah it's uh original idea
no
oh that's me
uh
come on
ah
yes well uh uh i shall give a short talk about the the technical function design
um i thought the the the technical function design was uh to uh for a remote control to to to
have some influence on the t v  set
uh both audio and vide video uh in a cordless way no cords attached
and uh well it all by pushing a button on the remote that was from my
own experience and uh and uh the previous meeting
uh i find some uh some interesting quotes on the web uh well the same idea here uh message to the television
and uh and and and well basic uh operations like on and off and uh switching channels and uh and maybe uh teletext or something like that
uh well these are two uh remotes and that's our uh our dilemma i think uh
we just heard from the industrial designer how uh difficult it is but uh shall we make a basic remote control uh just uh swapping channels and volume and uh power button and well nothing much more
or uh uh more functions on the remote uh maybe more devices you can influence uh a radio or a v a video recorder uh v c r 
yeah well that's our dilemma um any ideas about that
basic or multifunctional
okay yeah yeah well the that was just on my mind so uh i didn't know what uh
what way we would go
mm yeah well that was my uh functional uh talk

mm hmm
mm hmm
no
and i don't uh i don't think twenty five euros for a remote is really cheap or something so it's
yeah it's hard to uh
get the younger
group
mm hmm
just the l c d  mm hmm

well a power button
uh the well um i think separate channels so
but then both the the separate channels so so uh zero to nine or something
uh volume
oh mine
technical
mm yes
mute
um
yeah but then it's always uh more than one uh
thing to do
that's my task okay uh i've
where have i put it my documents or not
hmm
i've save it on my computer my presentation
but where
uh uh uh
it was about the working of the remote control
nope
not a of
wait
the working design but i've saved it
but now i don't know where it is
hmm
yeah
and i import this until
one more

what the fuck is this

yeah that's the empty one
i had one
uh huh
open it
okay here it is
project
okay
a little later but here it is
so okay it's a little difficult what i'm gonna tell you it's about the working of the remote control i just had an half an hour j to study it and i don't get it
ten minutes to tell it okay i think it will be a few minutes and first uh i will tell you something about the findings what i discovered about the remote control the working bout it uh of it
uh then i'll have uh some kind of map and it's the top of the remote control with a little bit of science uh you i will show that uh in in a few minutes and then uh what i'll think about it
first the findings the remote control is a very difficult uh thing to uh
to explain to just all of you wh who haven't seen a remote control uh inside
uh there's a lot of uh plastic on it um because its uh not so expensive
and there are uh a lot of uh wires uh which um
connect the components in it the battery and there are um switches and things like that
there's a lot of small uh electronics so it won't be um uh too expensive
to build it only twelve euro fifty i think uh we will make it
now and here i have the top of the remote control uh here's some kind of chip
uh on top of this there are uh the numbers uh you have all on your remote control
and uh the teletext uh button and uh here's the battery
and when you push the button it will uh will be sent to the chip and
the chip will um send it to all kind of sub components
that's what i said it's very difficult and after that it will be sent to the infrared and that
will send it to your television
that's a short h uh how it works uh i think i can uh make it uh difficult but we all
we all don't get it
my preferences it's uh it won't be uh we shouldn't make it too big
uh also for the cost uh we should only put one battery on it a long lasting battery
uh also for the cost uh use only plastic not other materials also
because of the cost uh not too much buttons on it
we can also make uh a button uh with a menu uh button and then um
that that you will see it on the t v  and on the t v  you can uh switch into the menu that's
i think it's easier
and the bleep signal y uh you told us uh but we can also use it uh a bleep like something
when the battery's empty then there is a bleep then you'll have to change it in a in a week or something and also
the bleep when what i told you about uh when you lost it and you push a button and then you hear bleep bleep and
we will find it
this is uh just uh yeah yeah
if we w if we use only just one uh small pen light then it will be cheaper than when we use two
yeah but then we'll have to make the um remote control uh long lasting just
yeah
yeah
but uh i think this our remote control is for the televisions we uh we sell in our company or is it also for other company uh for other televisions
then this is an option maybe just a menu button to use it on our televisions and then we make it easier uh for our televisions and on the other tele televisions you can also use it but then we won't use the
yeah okay then i think uh the menu button uh will only work on the newer televisions
and we will uh look forward and don't make a remote control which for the older televisions
and i just uh have one more idea uh maybe it's one of your tasks but uh
to have a trendy remote control we can also um make something like the nokia um
mobile phones to change covers
so if you have uh a trendy half with all red uh yellow and something and then you can put a red cover on it and also different things
yes
uh then it won't be uh will have just one cover on the uh original one and then you can buy the covers
i think it will be a little more difficult but not too much
just like with the nokia uh mobile phones just one
yeah but then we'll have to to just um put five covers on it and see if it works if it won't works then we'll get something else then we uh won't g uh go further with it
uh a p a a cover made in uh in china it it won't be i guess so expensive i think
maybe i wi i won't but maybe i think trendy people or like children where you can paint on it and uh the the children think oh this is my remote control uh i made a picture on it uh
yeah
okay
and the other people what do you think about it
okay
okay you're the project manager yes that's it

'kay



yeah i have uh one question if we aim for the younger people um and there
will be uh a lot of features like l c d  or the the the speech uh f recognising
uh the cost will be a lot of h uh a lot higher uh i think we don't have that in
our budget do you think like
no no
uh huh

'kay we'll just have to do that okay
no discussion about it okay unfortunately
to change to the next channel just one button to move up move down
but then we come to the costs
but now we have only the buttons and uh we don't yet have to decide what the remote control would look like or
okay
okay
okay
okay



desktop
yeah okay well


make it

hmm
hmm
will this will this add to the cost
yes but you have to m uh be able to change it d does it make it more difficult to design
not much 'kay
um
mm

yeah
yes
okay
uh um m
yeah

um yeah okay this bit too far
so
so i'm uh gonna have a presentation about um the market about um
yeah what people think uh we did a usability lab test with a hundred persons
and we looked at uh several um things uh among them design uh d d how d did
they like the use of it uh what frustrations they had while using remote controls
uh well what what will be our market and uh we asked them if we had some new featu features if um that would be a good idea or not
well our findings uh our users they disliked the look and feel of current remote controls
um uh they especially found found them very ugly and um
th they also found them hard to to learn how to use it uh well they also zap a lot
so uh zapping uh should be very easy
and uh fifty percent of the users only use ten percent of the buttons so a lot of unused buttons there is more findings
uh on the buttons which uh buttons find users uh very important and which which not and how much would they use them well uh the most used button is the channel selection
and uh we asked them how uh relevant they think uh the buttons are the power volume and channel selections are very relevant uh teletext is uh less relevant but also important
uh not important they found the audio uh that's not the volume but uh specific the the pitch or the left or right uh the screen and the brightness and uh channel settings
uh th and they also are not used very often then we have a few um graphs about the market uh here we can see what the market share is of uh several groups
um as you can see most users are uh between thirty six and forty five um
the the the younger group between sixteen and twenty five is not very big and to come back
on the the swapping uh things uh i don't think uh i
i think the younger will be most interest in it
but uh they are not a very big group um in the we asked them uh how would you like a s a new feature if you have an l c d  on the remote control what would you think of it
now you can clearly see young users say i will that would very nice and older
user think uh they will be scared of change i think and they won't like it and
another thing how would you like to have a speech recognition on it
well here we see the same young users uh think that's an interesting idea and old users not
uh well we uh found out that there are two several markets at which we can aim
uh the first are the younger the age between sixteen and forty five uh they are highly
interested in the features as you can see uh here
and um they are more critical on their money spending
uh the second group is the older group aged between forty six and sixty five
they are less interested in uh new features but uh they spend their money more easily now if we
look back at this graph we can see that among the first group is about
um sixty percent and the second group about forty percent
so the the first group is bigger well then i come to my uh personal preferences uh yeah the first question is uh also we have to ask is at the which market do we aim at
uh of course n uh saying we aim at the young group doesn't say that old people won't buy it but
less of them will buy it um well i uh okay
what i thought um even young people say it's hard to use
remote control so if you make a remote control that is uh very easy to use that's especially aimed at this group even uh the young group will also be more interested
and um we can make special features but uh i think it looks nice in the first time but when use it uh i don't know what's uh good thing of speech recognition
um well th uh that's my second point uh less important functions should be discarded from the remote control it's about discussion we had earlier um
you can find most functions on a t v  set
so uh you don't have to have a lot of audio options or screen options to change the brightness
and such things um well the design is very important one thing i did not say i think is that a lot of users also said then i would uh buy a good looking uh remote control if there will be one
but they found most remote controls very ugly so the design of our remote control is very important and uh yeah it should be very zap friendly as most users use it for that
that were my findings
yes
no
okay

yeah maybe we can first have a discussion uh on the the product requirements you just uh said
the the requirements you just said maybe we should first have a discussion about that i
uh personally think uh teletext is a good option uh not everyone um
who is looking t v  can go to internet when they want to see the latest news

okay okay sorry then uh


mine it's the functional requirements
d yeah do we make a menu
uh

i think it will be um q quite easy to use to have uh uh four arrows up down for
channel selection and left right uh for volume and uh a menu
uh button and if you press the menu button you get into the menu and you can use the same buttons but
the then to scroll through the menu and to change the options
uh well yeah that depends on if you have uh the menu on the t v  or you get the menu on the l c d  screen on the remote control
yes
'kay
but well if you aim at the younger market um a as they as uh s uh as we seen in the usability uh lab uh they will buy a nice looking um
remote control
and also to find the easy to use uh part very important so if we have a
l c d  sh uh screen and uh not too many buttons i think that will incre
uh uh even when it's a bit more cost it will still sell
mm
yeah
okay good idea
mm
so you found your spots
okay
it's called black

okay
you see this beautiful presentation okay let's get started
uh i sort of prepared this uh opening acquaintance
tool training uh how to use the things here uh project plan discussion and
yeah then the rest of the meeting um we're supposed to develop a new
remote control that's both original trendy and user friendly
so hope you have good ideas i don't um
we're work we're working uh from top to bottom uh functional design then we do some in individual
work then we have a meeting to discuss the results etcetera etcetera
and at the end of the day we should have a prototype drawn up
uh we have available the smart board and the whiteboard um
uh we should take some practice i have some instructions now to do that uh well you know how to the documents work so
uh this for toolbar you see it next um
we have a pen and we can use this pen to perform yes so
it doesn't always work
yes okay so you can
draw
okay and in the format menu you can select colour and line width etcetera etcetera okay
uh
okay each of you can uh take some practice and you should draw an animal
uh you should explain
uh with different colours and with different pen widths and you should explain why you draw that particular animal so julian
uh with the format menu
and use different colours etcetera
and what's that supposed to be
oh yeah oh yeah four legs uh huh
yeah
yeah you can press the next button which is uh yeah i'll show you yeah in file menu
yeah

yeah what is it
a giraffe okay yeah i see a long neck but
okay that's nice of you
okay yeah pretty good uh could you press the next uh
okay then uh
yeah sorry introduction and get acquainted and
that's the idea so
yeah it's a bit slow so
yeah
pressure
why a turtle
it's slow you were slow too so

yeah sure yeah not exactly legs but
more like fins or

yeah
yeah it's l looks very friendly
yeah okay
no
yeah yeah yeah there's a a gum gum to
he said it was slow
i like it
okay
your turn niels
the next yeah
makes new paper
yeah
orange
kangaroo
dog
cat
it's a cat
why a cat
you have some uh
the pen yeah
sure
yeah alright
okay
yeah
i think it's okay you get idea right okay
um we have a financial aspect to this project um we can sell them at twenty
five euros uh
the aim is to reach uh uh to sell as much as fifty million euros uh that's quite a big amount of money
and the production cost should be the half of the selling price
okay now it's time for some discussion
uh
yeah we should get started
uh i'm taking notes um
we each have a specific task as i saw in my mail i didn't know if you received
the same mail yeah okay so the um uh this industrati industrial
designer should produce a working design am i correct
okay uh the user interface designer should specify the technical functions
right yeah and the marketing uh expert should come up with user requirements uh did any of you already do some work on this part or
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm and do you have any ideas about the product uh so far
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah
mm hmm okay
yeah i got another point it uses infrared light to communicate the signal to the t v  apparatus or stereo
same i believe
uh and what did the marketing expert do
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm
mm hmm
mm hmm
yep
yes
okay
okay
mm hmm
okay and you can get that information
okay that would be very handy um but have you any idea so far as what uh the user requirements are
no
no okay
yeah
of course
big mm hmm
uh what do you mean by that
okay um
well i don't think i have anything more to add at the moment
um
i think the best is to go to work
yeah
okay
yeah i think
we can go ahead with what we have i will summarise the things we discussed and put it in the project folder
uh the use of the industrial designer can work on the working design etcetera etcetera and it seems you get more information by email
so that was it for me
uh
yeah in the project folder yeah i'm writing very fast hope it's readable okay um anything more you want to add to the discussion
yeah because then we have a
yeah y you do some individual work we have meeting individual work meeting and at the end of the day we have
a final meeting and then i have to prepare uh i have to defend our design so make
it good i depend on you
yeah if you can mix it it's okay
mm hmm yeah
yeah
well i think that is the user
requirements part as to what they want uh do they want all those functions on that small
yeah
mm hmm
yeah i understand
you can always add a few
yeah
hmm the c d  player yeah
yeah
okay
mm hmm
okay
you need additional yeah
yeah uh
yeah
yeah we could just start with the assumption that's only for t v  and video and um
reserve the possibility to add other features so we have a basic starting point and you can always extend
that so make sure it's extendible yeah
th the least amount of functions possible so it's easier to get to know how it works etcetera
yeah okay and uh i'll see you again uh when the computer tells us to
yeah you're di dismissed not yet okay
let's see what we got to do
yeah
yeah thank you


mm uh
mm
we're the first ones
move to the meeting room okay
hello good day yep
kick off meeting wow
it's uh looks uh nice
hmm
yeah
no it's it was uh not enough

i did my best



okay
um yeah

it's a giraffe yeah
okay
uh it needs some uh some yellow uh
oh format
that's some spots
no


okay do i have to explain uh why i chose this uh this animal
i think it's a it's a great animal it's a it's a giraffe
yeah that's a
um
okay i'll will give it an uh an eye
hey come on
the next yes
here you go hmm


'cause it's so 'cause it's green


no

a rabbit i think kangaroo
fox

mm

okay what uh what uh do you want to discuss
yep
yep
yeah wireless uh huh
uh it's uh some buttons for for the on off function you d you already told that and for the changing up to the to all the channels and changing the volume
that are the the basic options for a remote control
okay yeah
yeah
yep
i got some uh requirements it has uh it has to be user friendly uh
really easy to use buttons not not uh very small buttons but not the the also the big big
buttons but just normal buttons it has to be a small unit it has to be uh yeah
you can take it with you uh everywhere in in your house so it has n has not to be l yeah gigantic
uh machine
uh and a and a good uh zapping range
uh the distance uh from your television to your uh remote control has to be uh yeah um yeah quite a big distance it has to be capable for zapping uh
yeah
okay
are you going to put the the notes on the
okay
yeah
yep
yeah do we only have to to do uh phase one the functional design uh
after that we are going to the conceptual uh

okay
i would first m
yeah i i think we have first to start with the basic functions and we can uh expand them yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah it it has yeah it has to be user friendly so it's hasn't it's yeah
yeah
okay
yeah
can we leave now or

mm
okay
good luck
hi
oh yeah we have to talk in english huh
i'm afraid i'm a bit slow for this stuff uh
i'm afraid i'm a bit too slow i don't know how much preparation you guys did but not a lot
mm hmm
not yet
operations

different pen widths how do you do that
oh okay
are you serious
i in the file option menu
how much time do we have to draw anyway 'cause i can take forever on this

is this part of our a acquai or introduction to each other
alright
uh your line broke
i'm guessing a turtle
no i'm kidding
because of its shell
dude you're a good drawer
do you have a turtle pet
uh okay
yeah yeah yeah
stumpy stuff
they kind of l look like mole legs with sharp nails on

a little tail maybe

uh no
the little holes maybe
and why did you choose this animal
alright
alright
colours were under format right let's see how am i gonna do this um
mm uh
not quite actually
no aye
it's a cat not quite yet through
uh yeah i dunno they're my favourite pets
uh i have colour already
yeah i'm not so good at drawing with this kind of st oh shit um
excuse my language
i don't know how to draw its face but you get the idea it's a cat it's my favourite uh pet animal
'cause they're cute they're independent and cuddly i dunno that's
it or do i need to use more colours and
alright yeah

so we have to s
yeah
mm hmm
i guess so yeah
true
well i started making an overview for myself um what i had to do 'cause we have three
design steps and in every step i have a s specific task to perform or whatever so i had to
uh i dunno make an overview for myself about what i have to do and kind of let
it work in to get ideas about
well how i have to fill it well i started i started with the first phase i think was the functional
and uh let's see i had to focus on the working
design which you said how does the apparatus work and well i basically had two
points
uh according to the coffee uh machine example i have batteries to supply
energy and we ye use button presses to activate or deactivate
certain functions on the t v  and that's basically all i have so far
alright
yeah
yeah
yeah i kept it global 'cause that it activates or deactivates specific functions 'cause i wasn't thinking yet
about that i mean you wanna ch ch flip the channel but you might wanna use teletext also
i dunno what the word is in english uh
yeah obviously
whoa is that you or alright
alright
alright
well no i'm just a bit wondering what we're gonna do the next uh
session
yeah okay we'll do our best
i am gonna work on the conceptual design already 'cause yeah it's fairly important to know
what kind of components we want to put in do we i mean is it gonna be a multimedia control
centre do we want to be able to use the video recorder with it
yeah true
but but we need good communication about this stuff 'cause i have to f put the components into the design so if i don't know what components to put in it's kind of hard
yeah so
okay
yeah i i know what you mean but you'll ne need several other buttons for a video player you need
a play and a forw fast forward and a stop function and you you don't need that for a t v  and
and for a t uh teletext you need additional buttons as
well so i kind of need to know what we uh need
whatever i'll just put my ideas in uh
in here and then we can discuss it with the next uh
meeting
okay
okay
alright
yeah i understand yeah
alright
yeah
thanks
alright
see you later
what the

we're the first
marketing expert yes

yes
bling bling yeah
right
uh where has my screen gone

hmm
yeah my screen is gone oh

yeah
yeah very nice
yeah
mm


yeah

yeah
draw alright
'kay

don't take up too much space

should it be one
giraffe's yellow
can you use one blank sheet per drawing or so y you must save it at the end and then
okay then m make a new one

it's more like a dinosaur
uh
some leaf to eat
yeah thanks
yeah
uh
yeah
alright it's not that fast yeah
i see it misses the spot
i say good guess
uh
because it's slow yeah i was a bit slow too so
uh some other line uh width uh
no
i dunno does it have legs yeah

it's more like a tank
yeah that's fins but i don't know where

some spots
ah some eye

yeah that's a fr friendly turtle i guess
yeah well i think it's uh fair enough
right i don't know what the position is
does it have ears
no oh okay can you erase ears or yeah
alright eraser
so
i dunno i it just came into my mind so there's no particular reason i pen
yeah
well i'm guess i'm done that's my turtle
how to select the next or here
yeah here you go
a fox yeah firefox
a cat who had an accident or

yeah
okay great
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
so that's very common
yeah
yeah
uh well from a marketing uh perspective um well the function des design
phase uh consists out of the user requirements um what needs and desires are to be
fulfilled so there are a few means to reach that um by by doing research
uh to see what existing products are there out in the market i mean what functions do they have um
especially what are their shortcomings are there any new functions uh which can be added to
our product
um therefore we have to to do some internet search for example for um
well what kind of applications do current remote controls support and what are f featur features of
uh current and future televisions so we can see uh what needs to be supported
um and we can interview current users and future users what w what would they like to see
uh on a new remote control um especially for future users uh
i'm thinking of early adopters because they they use new technology first and they play with a
lot of tools and stuff so maybe they have some good ideas to uh to add
i think i can get that information yeah
so yeah
no n not specifically more to how to get them and
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
from the other end of the room or something yeah
any more points to discuss
alright
'kay thanks
yeah the pro okay
yeah okay
uh
i guess so
yeah we're just working the three phases
okay better make it
yeah that is my question also because like new new functions
requirements yeah
yeah
unit
yeah
yeah well i i was
yeah well like l li like some like some some remotes who
are out there which i know there's one button which is very easy to switch between devices so
you can switch to your video and then the same buttons control your video and another function
i'll think of switch to your media centre because that's getting very popular and then use your windows media
centre under your t v  with the same remote control so with the switch one single switch
s
yeah records and stuff like that
no
yeah
yeah
in the project uh
yeah
yeah
yeah
yes
half an hour
you're fired no
alright let's move on
yeah
yeah see you later
well good luck
right first time this time
nu
there we go
it's not that complicated but i get it wrong every time

for matthew yep
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
yep
mm hmm
i have a presentation i'm just making this
okay i'll just email you this file my presentation
mm hmm i'm just emailing it to you
okay it should've gone through to you
mm hmm
okay so this is just a presentation on uh the trends that we're gonna use to make the product stand out from the rest of the products out there at the moment um can i just put this on
so we have to work out a way what we can do with our product to make it stand out and make it so people wanna buy it
um
this is to do this i will not remove my microphone

we basically used um some focus group surveys which i went through with you last time the main results of that
and um some research on the current design um and fashion trends that are out
there at the moment um and as part of this
the important aspects that came out were things that we've already discussed really the most important by far was the look and feel of it it needs
to be something that's very different from everything else out there it needs to stand out it needs to be not
functional like the rest of the things out there at the moment most people find remote controls boring at the moment we need to have something that looks
interesting that looks exciting that will stand out people will wanna buy it um
that was twice as i important as the next item on here which is that it has to be technologically innovative has to have
something else apart from just the look of it people have to then think about it and say got something there that i want
that's a really cool feature and it has to make them wanna buy it again
third on the list and again innovative was twice as important as this last um aspect it has to be easy to use so they have to be able to be able to look at it and have some intuitive idea of how to use it um
drawing on the fashion trends at the moment uh fruit and vegetables um
this is basically talking about just the the feel of it so probably not the smell of it but the bright colours um eye catching
really bold designs and a spongy feel um i had a talk to the design people about this but having
a remote that's tactile that feels different that would be really cool that would make it stand out um
well ma make it not necessar sp spongy is the current thing spongy is the current texture but
basically there are no reports no remotes at the moment which are spongy or tactile at all so if we make
it like maybe furry or soft or something that'll be something that sets it apart
rather than just bare plastic which they all are at the moment
so as far as the design goes the very most important aspect was the design to the customers
so going with the fruit and vegetable idea we've got the bright colours so makes it stand out
the oranges and the the bright yellows and the florescent colours part of the fruit and vegetables um
going back to the idea of taking inspiration from mobile phones they've all got those a lot of them have the changeable covers so they can choose what colour the outside is that's one way of looking at it um
textured feel we just talked about maybe it's another way of doing that so if it's part of the the changeable covers then may maybe they
can choose a different texture a spongy one or a soft one or something like that so they can choose it li as they want
to to maybe to fit in with their decor in their living room or just what they like their sports team or whatever
um and yeah still taking the inspiration from the mobile phone design so
functionality the way the mobile phones work the way the keypad looks also just the way that
a lot of industrial design is going into mobile phones at the moment they're big selling items people put a lot of thought into that
so we can leverage off that and we can start using some of their ideas
um back to technological in in innovation not quite as important but still a big issue
um we talked about having a way of finding a remote control if it's been lost uh that's one
thing we could look at there are other aspects like l c d  screens and speech recognition which weren't
i don't think in my personal opinion gonna be worth the extra expense and the extra effort that will go into them i think we're better doing something basic like this which is very important and very will be a really cool feature to put in
and
use i had no real specific ideas for this maybe we just the basic idea of having
your core functions big and at the top maybe by themselves and then yeah
and then th th the finer details of buttons you don't use as much either hidden away or completely separate
yep and that's the presentation
so does anyone have any comments or ideas on that i think you
hmm
well we're selling so many units of this this is gonna be a mass marketed product we can afford to have two or three different designs at least
mm mm
mm
mm
mm hmm
mm
mm hmm yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm
mm
mm i like the idea though of having speech recognition for like the n the name of a channel like b b c  rather than having to remember the the number of it on the keypad that's a good idea
mm
hmm
mm yeah i really like that idea
mm hmm
mm
maybe ten channels yeah at the most
mm
mm hmm
mm
mm
mm hmm
mm b
but a coffee machine there's not too many words they'd be using with that it's a it's a small vocabulary
mm
mm
mm
mm

two thirty five supposed to finish
hmm
hmm
mm
yeah
mm
i think you can do it both ways you can have it so it's easy they can pick it up and use it straight away without doing anythi without customizing it or if they want to they have the option of using these extra features
hmm
hmm
hmm
mm
hmm
mm
hmm
mm
hmm
i like the idea too of being able to use the remote in the dark so either having the buttons so you can feel the difference between them or if they if they light up or something
mm
mm
hmm
mm
hmm
mm

mm hmm
mm


mm hmm
mm hmm
mm just have a yeah
just the veneer on it yeah
hmm
mm
mm hmm
well maybe we need specific costings then actually do maybe two designs and then cost them out and see which one is gonna fit in our budget better
mm
mm
hmm
mm yeah sure
mm hmm
mm
mm
mm
so is there any of these that you're looking at particularly or is this just ideas
mm hmm
hmm
mm
mm
mm yeah
you see
yeah
mm well one i've had before a r r remote control we have at home is one that's actually got a cover on the bottom so the bottom bit is just covers half the keys most of the time and then you can slide the cover back to get to the the more advanced keys
mm
mm
yeah
um yeah i've seen that before too anoth another like b it flips up and then you've got another layer of buttons underneath
mm
but i've seen also with keys and buttons on the top of here as well
i like this one i like the shape of this one
can we have can we think about maybe having a a non recta non non rectangular one so with not just the straight little box that's a maybe curved or something
mm mm 'kay is this for the next meeting though i think we might be out of time out of time for this meeting
yep
no
so is this is there anything else i need to do from a marketing point of view for the next meeting
mm
okay well is this me designing a way to evaluate it so
thinking about how to set up test groups and things
mm
okay
yep
mm
hmm
mm hmm
mm 'kay thanks guys
mm
uh
so i suggest we start the meeting uh without matthew uh he's uh obviously late for some reason
good
um
today uh we will uh talk about uh conceptual design
i hope uh you both did some uh some work uh
concerning a uh conceptual design um this will be the uh agenda for
the meeting uh uh i will
take some minutes uh again um we will have the presentations of y of you different team members and then try to come to decisions uh about the concepts uh you have presented
so and that uh will uh we have some uh forty minutes uh to complete this uh
so um who has the fir do you ha anna do you have your presentation ready
okay
ah there is matthew
so
good
do presentation ready
oh okay
so did you manage uh
oh yes i see him good yes
no
okay mm yes i have it
mm
mm
hmm
spongy feel
mm
okay
mm hmm
mm
yes well maybe matthew can can give some more information on the
mm
okay good that's very clear
'kay
um
uh
maybe we yes well we maybe can decide later on um the l the the look and feel of uh i've it was a good idea maybe to to
yes the the the there are changeable covers but on the other hand i i don't know whether
my superiors would be so glad with it because you have to introduce a complete uh
uh new l line of uh of supplies uh it would be uh very complicated uh
organisational
hmm mm hmm
yes
mm hmm
yes and of course it will be a we we get a if it works we can get uh after sales i mean that would would be very good i mean those covers could go for for three five euro
that's a very good idea um
and then uh
maybe uh we can go a th matthew's presentation because
the
together indeed uh because you ma might have some some information on the the easy to use what you were already mentioning
um yes but but i do maybe you can give a hand to us because i i'm not sure whether that that we can implement that for twelve euro and fifty cents i'm sorry to have
every time i have to come down on this price again to so this might be a little limiting for your creativity but it's it's it's the real
we have to consider it s so do we think these ideas an and
my uh sp speech recognition i mean maybe it's possible for for twelve euro but then then it will be
at cost of other functionality we might implement like the uh uh the the the
furry uh uh case of the
mm
mm mm
hmm
hmm
mm
'kay good
mm yes um i would
yes yes you can you can still we have time
nice
mm hmm
well well m m maybe m maybe we can give the uh the uh the case a very
uh uh normal a v very normal case but with the changeable covers to fancy it up
so like a normal cheap plastic case which can be covered up in for instance a wooden case i
mean just what
mm hmm
mm
no of course
so
so i f i think we we should come to some decisions now uh a
about this um so i understand uh when we want a display we need a expensive
chip but when we want a scrolling wheel w we also need the expensive
chip so can we use same chip so with one expensive chip
we can uh implement several complicated uh or advanced features
yes
mm hmm
mm hmm
so when the more expensive chip you mentioned there is is possible in the in the given budget uh maybe we should go for for the more expensive chip so all features uh which you mentioned can be implemented based on the same chip
do you think that's feasible
uh
you th you think it's possible
hmm
mm yes wh when you make a a design ca you can next meeting you can give an quite an exact cost price that w that would be a very good idea
mm
good good
yes but i can i think uh i think we can just use more cheap plastic
for a kind of basic edition and then people can fancy it up with with more expensive materials which
which come with a with another price
do do you agree
ma i i think uh for next meeting we c you two can present a real design
uh so drawing it on the board
and then we now sh only have to t to decide the general function uh
so um
let let's say next meeting w you produce two designs one one
one less advanced and one more advanced and with the cost price
uh furthermore we go for the for the uh basic plastic case which can be later uh fancied up with uh
with addit uh additional uh how do you call them these like like mobile telephones you can put a cover over it but that that that that can be done later we now can concentrate on the on the basic remote control
um
mm
mm hmm
yes yes yes bi big keys is is good thing i think
no no
mm mm mm
mm w but then you have still have uh when you don't use it you have such a a
an extent of your remote control which you don't use so maybe it's possible uh i don't know
whether you can can indicate this that you can elsewhere open your remote control and on the inside
are uh buttons you don't use that much
yes
yes i i th that's what i mean so i mean something
like like a book
mm
ju just make two designs
and the we we can decide decide between th those designs
i think that would be a good idea so anyone uh any questions for now
um yes i come to that uh uh
yes well m maybe uh i don't know whether that's possible maybe you can start evaluating uh their work somehow
i don't know whether that's possible uh in the given time but a as far as possible
so uh you two will be together w working on a o on two prototypes
and further instructions will be uh will be sent to you by uh by email
two
i
mm and then
hmm
yes okay
okay let's call this to an end
sorry
so
yeah i sent you the slides you didn't see them
okay
so

'kay



you can
yeah
voila
yeah
yeah s then we could discuss later like we can put all ideas together
it should be easier with that
yeah
so
yeah
yeah so i'll i'll go with that actually so um
okay so m so then the
the idea of uh having a remote is generally you have uh different keys
and uh different structures different forms and uh they could be like buttons
or like and um they could be of uh a
varying sizes if you want to to uh basically emphasize
a particular key more than the other and uh maybe like you can have different colours
for example having the r red for the on off switching on and off the button
so this this is the general trend to ha the method they do so what
i have found was that uh currently uh the they are
mostly that the t v  v c r  music system operated ones actually and they are very specific
to each other but there are some common keys for example if you want to follow the v c r  and if you want
to follow the uh g uh s some uh soundtrack on the w w
see they have the common thing actually you can have and uh
there is also um a speech recognition to store channel information
names like you can basically if you have a multiple functionality say t v  v c r  or something
i say it to the t v  and the t v  and you can programme the keys if you want
to certain keys are even the channel information
yeah yeah so you you you can just uh because uh as more and more channels
come then you have more and more problems to remember the v v exact channel numbers ex
exactly even if you arrange it by however you arrange it you still have the problem to remember
exactly which channel you want to
so it it it's like it limited one in the present market i saw it that
says something like they are looking for eighty word thing eighty word which shouldn't
be th that difficult to implement like eighty to hundred word basically you want
you don't want to store all the channels in the remote control you want to st store your favourite channel
yeah some ten twelve channel information you know you don't want to st store all the hundred channel information into that
and uh basically uh it depends like the remote with l c d  display for browsing
because you have multiple functionalities for example you are watching a movie and uh uh you are
having a universal remote control and you want to uh you don't know really which
functionality is now so i am using the t v  so
every time i use it it could be like for example i can use a simple toggle switch
and a display so i press it so the display says okay i'm in t v  or d v d  or whatever it is instead
of having three keys separately for four keys to model the functionalities will increase actually and
for you and you might want you don't want separate keys for all of them you can't
and uh well there can be children friendly where you can programme your remote so that they they are not
allowed uh to browse certain channels which you can block them and
you can operate them so these are the things presently which are seen in the market scenarios at present
i personally would look at things like having a u universal remote is uh
um is a good idea like instead of having unusual
ones for all of them you can think of having um with multiple functionality
possibly with speech recognition i got a mail from the the coffee machine interface unit that
uh they have uh integrated the s speech recognition into a
into the coffee machine and so if you say hello coffee machine it say hi joe or something like that you know
and uh
yeah you you won't be using it so it's a limited vocabulary mm thing and very isolated word and
it's uh it is interesting and basically storing the channel through voice or
other ways of programming your keys on the display for
the browsing which is again and maybe having something like a blinking thing like
uh it could indicate you're uh it it could indicate what is cal like the
uh whether uh you you have enough battery in your in your
uh remote the blinking at the same time if it's a dark room it can be used to locate the
remote also or
yeah you can let them to do that
n no but the if you give it d depends on the easiness like the user how much effort he can put
like for example uh i would like to store in certain way so if you want to give the full freedom
to the user or you want to keep some constraints and let the user use
it with that constraint so it de
so
so
yeah
yeah
we well we can still look at we can talk with the coffee unit and you can uh check how much how much they yeah yeah yeah
maybe we can come we we can talk to them and we can come with that you know and also well you can
think of having uh since you have a you know something maybe if you added little bit of display you might
need the to che keep checking the battery so you really need a some kind of indicator so it could be a blinking
option of l e d  it could actually be used to detect also if it's
in a dark room you can basically detect it also
so
no actually i if i it is like you know it tells you um it can be for two purposes
like if you have an l c d  display and all those things it's not going to be the standard remote which is having
uh which need just uh six six volt uh th sorry three volts um
of d c 
it may need more actually so y you you may need to check your battery usage it
and then you need that some functionality to indicate the battery limit and then if the battery limit is
indicated if it could be ind indicated through a blinking something and it can change the colour
depending on your uh how much is the battery well that is good enough to even locate even
if you want to
you know
yeah so
you you have time some more yep
sure you can you know
hmm
mm hmm
yeah mm mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah
yeah
sorry
yeah so of course for example uh i wanted to know like if you want to have a a
fo if you want to have the l c d  display over there or if you want to store
a programmes with a keys
what kind of things you'll need inside your thin inside
w wh what
w what
okay
okay
okay so in that case you can even look at the technology what the mobile phone is trying to use with the card
yeah where they do all the wi with with them actually how f cost effective it would be to put that car chip into it and do the programmable things
d well
well i don't know if it'll fit into our cost of twelve point five euro you know
is it possible to fit in to that
sorry
yeah that's uh that's something which i wanted to ask you also like what will be the each individually the cost of it for example if f if you want to put wood i wouldn't suggest for wood uh 'cause it's i think it's m
much easier to use a plastic or a rubber rather than wood it will be much ch much expensive th though it's the most natural thing but
yeah
yeah it's uh
yeah we we can give a preference to them but it is but with plastic or the rubber or whatever it is it's much better with that rather than going for
yeah
yeah
yea
okay
yeah sure
yeah we will uh
yeah
uh
yeah
okay
we can give them smooth keys you know
smooth keys
with bigger s uh
so that you know
the the problem most of the time we've seen the keys is that it's small and every time we have
to be very but if i the if we if we go to a different ways of designing those keys
then you can merge them together to
oh you can actually for example if you see they are they are they are quite small over here and uh
now you can for example as i was if you make them big it may change the look of the thing
also to the people at the same time it is m more uh like it would be more
interesting for people who are having this r s i  and all problem uh big keys may better for
them actually and uh
yeah
yeah
yeah
yes
yeah so it's something like this the model here s you can put the keys
yeah yeah

yeah
yeah mm
we should make a
yeah that yeah next meeting we should be
yeah that would depend upon us actually
yeah okay

no no
i don't have
maybe it would be interesting if you could look um
for the cost inventories of other devices if you're using speech recognition or something like that
mm
two
one for like cost and the one with like higher end so that then we can be easily comparing them or you know find a compromise between both of them yeah that's how it is
yep
okay
so we are done
for now
okay so we are just waiting for matthew
mm 'kay
yep
mm hmm
yeah i think yeah the matthew it is it's important that matthew yeah is here because
it's really a a team uh project with a team and if someone is not here then we cannot but it's okay it's good


mm hmm
so can you repeat and be more precise about what you just said
uh about the feeling yeah uh yo
okay
yeah
yeah that's a very good idea yeah
yeah
mm hmm
yeah very clear
to let the people choose you mean yeah

yeah a range of uh yeah a set of three four different aspects
sure that fits the
yeah
yeah yeah i agree
yeah
and your part is very related to mine because when you suggest something then it has to be integrated inside
yeah
yeah
so what functionalities do you suggest for that
for facing this problem
okay
mm hmm
oh yeah yeah yeah mm
mm
mm hmm

yeah
and you want okay for coming back to one point y you want to let the user to programming the keys some of them
and uh isn't that too difficult for the we want w i don't know if we still want the um r c  to be easy to use that's the compromise
yeah
yeah
yeah
a standard
yeah
yeah
yeah
mm hmm yeah like i would say that for programming uh keys you said
uh it could be uh easily uh done within the the package of twel twelve euros
but for the a s r  system uh i'm not sure if it's feasible to have
this or
we

exactly yeah i if if it's a low vocabulary it's already implemented and w how much it's cost maybe with a f cheap chip
yeah
yeah
yeah
mm
it's true
mm hmm
i don't know how if if i have time to talk about the
okay
so what i'm gonna present here is very uh um
yeah basic knowledge about the all the the components that are
inside a a r c  a remote control and how is it manufactured h what
is the process just to explain you so the method is ther
there is a a set of components in a in a remote control like and uh
what cost the the components in themself do not cost a lot but the the way to assemble
everything costs obviously and i will uh show you my preferences uh
uh at the end
so there are two uh different types of uh um
two different ways of using the the components for making a a remote control uh the basic
way is to use a an integrated circuit and some uh transistors with an
that aims at communicating uh uh the message and to to
send the message to the um to the led that will uh transmit to the receiver
and uh yeah the other components and the circuit board buttons
infrared led etcetera for the components um
so you finding just to say that the chip can detect uh when a key is pressed and then
it translate to the key to a sequence something like morse code as you know
uh with a different sequence for each key and uh uh that's with
the components we will use we will have different uh messages different sequences
and the chips sends that signal signal to the transistor that amplify to make it stronger
um
so electronic parts are assembled onto uh printed boards uh because it's easier to
mass produce and assemble and uh so i think for our
design we want some b uh programmable uh you know v  v l s i 
or f p g a  uh high technology and this is important and also we'll
use uh yeah like in any uh high tech uh devices a chip of fi
fibreglass to them and connect them
so my personal design we need to find a solution what um
what is the material of the cover we want to use if it's plastic or you
said that yeah you had some ideas uh like fruit veg or i dunno
yes
yes
yes
yeah like they do in with cars i think yeah inside the car yeah so they also
emailed me that uh they have available a bunch of different buttons a scroll
wheels integrated push buttons s such as a computer mouse and
uh very cheap l c d s so liquid crystal displays so i'm wondering i think we might
be able to integrate l c d  into our r c 
and the final point okay is um we have yeah there are some
uh compromise to to do so we have to know that the push button requires a simple chip
but the scroll wheel uh and that kind of higher high tech stuff needs
more money um which is a higher price range alright
and the display requires an advanced chip which in turns is more expensive than the regular chip but
i think uh with twelve euros um and if it's uh uh made
for mm four million uh items then i think
w we could be able to handle that so to to sum up um
we need yeah so i i just said that the components uh the list of components uh has to be uh
yeah listed and um and um assembly is a an important
process that has to be taken into account and uh for the designing of the cove uh uh cover
layout then it's better to to to maybe see that with uh the the u r  exp u r i  expert
so that we can it's really a team working uh so i i cannot design something without
your agreement right
yes
yeah it's kind of um simple pro progra programmable device and we have to insert i think we could insert one that could underlie several functions of
exactly yeah for customizing and yeah
okay
yeah
yeah good idea
yeah
exactly yeah that's a very good idea we could have uh one main chip uh that could handle uh
it's called f p g a  chip that could handle both uh like scrolling wheels
as well as uh l c d  and yeah
yes
yeah also thinking i think both uh if we had a budget of twenty twenty uh euros it will be okay but uh
yeah that's an excellent idea
yeah yeah yeah because right now i don't have price in in head but for next meeting i'm sure yeah be able to do that
yeah
okay
i agree on that yeah
yeah but i it's a detailed uh yeah yeah uh plastic versus uh wood and we need maybe to centre
our description on uh the the really the what buttons what uh functionality
we want to offer to the user and maybe with uh graphs or
i don't know uh user interface designer you could maybe uh help us on that
yeah
perfect yeah
yeah
yeah customized
yeah
i agree yeah and not too m too many keys of course yeah
yeah
mm
that's what you mean
yeah i like also this one
yeah the point is w maybe we need to also to make a decision on how how how big we want to be and how many buttons like n we should dec decide numbers or
okay
yeah yeah yeah
perfect
exactly
yeah
two or three prototypes two
okay
yeah and find maybe a compromise
perfect yeah
thanks

okay good afternoon again
so we should have our final meeting about the
detail designed of detail design of the product of the remote control
um so here is the agenda for today uh uh just going to go quickly
through the minutes of the last last uh meeting then we have a p presentation of prototype of you
two sounds interesting and we'll have um presentation of
evaluation crit criteria by ou our marketing experts then we'll have to go through finance evaluation
of the of the cost of the thing and um hopefully uh we should
fit the target o tw of twelve point five uh uh euro
okay so let's go uh if i go quickly through the minutes of the last meeting
so we went through th uh w we took this following decisions
no l c d  no speech recognition technology okay we went through a b to a banana
look and feel for the remote control we went through the use of wheels and
but buttons and also the use of a basis station for battery ch charging
and uh also to um call the to call the mot mote remote control when it is lost
okay um good
so guys
let this uh wonderful thing
oh yeah sorry um
which is
yeah can you show it to the the camera maybe
mm hmm

what's the use uh of the t turbo button already
ah yeah yeah an then you stop when you stop it stops
uh huh
which one
okay
to navigate it through th through teletext
with the wheel it's easy
excellent
calling
excellent and the the leaves plays the roles of of antennas
oh
great
so what else
yeah they're light


ah yeah
so for the power source apparently you still you you want to use both solar cells and batteries
uh you mean okay so
yeah where are going to where are you are you going to place them
you have enough surface you
okay what will be the autonomy roughly
the autonomy
autonomy
uh i mean how long does i how how how long can it be held off a station
yeah a long
yeah so it's
it's used only when you
yeah f weeks
right
next slide
okay okay those really sounds very good nothing else to add
yeah
well in fact b both will be could be useful navigating through teletext
yeah
wow

very good uh yeah you th yeah bananas everywhere okay so

so we have to go through now evaluations
so your slides are ready
uh you're four i think so this is one which one is this one


num number
so to have in order to have enough granularity it's in order to have enough granularity in the evaluation
okay
okay
yeah six
s seven six
no wait what do you say seven five
okay six point five
handy
seven
so seven seven six
six point five
functional
four

uh for a remote control does he have all the
you could expect
yeah

so it's universal but for t v s
so s uh four
five four
four
okay cool cool device

yeah seven
six
plus six i say i said seven so it's six yeah
seven
seven and you
outl you are not lik outlier seven
okay okay okay okay

of course i'll buy the banana
well
twenty five euros
cheap
yeah so the target price is for all europe or only for rich countries it's more targeting u k  or
so this is selling costs not production costs
yeah yeah sure um
five
aw should be nice in your
it's kitsch
well don't forget well don't for don't forget who we're targeting also who are f f who are wh yeah youngst youngst
no well yeah i if you would be young
not telling that you are young li li like a teenager for instance
okay you're you're crazy teenager and you like fun things yeah
yeah you want to show the beautiful banana you have
okay so you s you give oh yeah yeah i know i know so you say two f i d i say five
you say
so what's the new question
uh yeah i think so

yeah that's two different question
ugly
i stick to five
w we have six five
three so we are
six five four
yeah
so
so and last question will i change my rem change my remote control from mando banana
um zero no uh we can't so one
well if
no uh let's say i'll put two
it's for the t v 
two three five two three fi and two so it's r
yeah three point five
no no you say five he is the outlier
okay just just do a sum
well maybe we should we should uh have a look globally glob
yeah
so maybe maybe w we can we should stick to general feeling we can had uh have a out of these numbers which which is that well we should go for it
problem with connectors
okay so let's move uh let's move on okay now
now we have to mm to estimate uh the cost
okay so i prepare an excel sh uh an excel sheet um
well we are going to calculate the production costs we should we should be below
twelve point five
so i already uh put some pu some numbers here okay
we are going to go through so this is the number the mm number of components we need for
this thing so it appears that there were things that we didn't thought about
uh and also things that i uh i d i forget to uh to put like solar cells
oh yeah finally we say no okay so let's let's go let's go let go through all the lines so hand dynamo this something we didn't thought about
but
yeah
yeah okay so we we stick to battery one
no kinetic also i don't i don't see the difference between kinetic and dynamo
ah you have to ah okay i see so kinetic is really uh shaking the banana crazy okay so those banana is falling
let's go ahead so we we st only have one for battery uh then for electronics um so i didn't put anything for the
yeah
yeah
okay no so we hin
yeah so one ooh ye ye ye the cost is increasing so we are
the beep
that's what
okay so i'll remove it
s
so don't we need a
oh there is no listing for r radio frequency thing so
yeah maybe we'll see later okay so in for the case um
i put single curved
because we have two things
no
well
what a what i if i put one here
yeah so let's put one here in the then instead of single oka all right so we stick to plastic it cost nothing
no it's too no
it's too expensive
we're already at eleven
okay so i put rubber one
okay so special colour yellow uh for the interface we have
we have three
no no we have two scroll and we have three push buttons

and
no it's no chip this is just radio frequency th this is no chip
it's just
yeah
no just only
okay w we didn't think a thought about uh integrated scroll wheel push buttons
yeah so
yeah
okay so no l c d 
so for we have no button supplements right
uh
well in fact could we could not we consider this button as a button supplement because oh no these are these are for colours co and special forms special colours and special materials so
okay so we are over budget
yeah
yeah
so mayb in fact n we have to put two here
because it cost nothing

exactly exactly so we have margin for that stuff
yeah maybe
okay good
wha
excellent
um we'll invest in r  and d 
yeah so well we're under the the the cost so we can go to through to project evaluation

sorry
which is different which is different none of us will buy it
this is a battery
this is what we which you can mm
it did yeah
extra battery yeah
exac

well in fact i i did not know i didn't know really what to say here if uh if you have any ideas of what we can we can say so
i don't i don't i don't understand what
what they mean by satisfaction um and for and for example
should it be more like um like a status of
of the these meetings in fact
yeah well in fact uh we we use a little bit the white board and the digital pen not that much
oh yeah it's really creative
yeah
yeah maybe we should go through yeah an uh evaluation
so maybe you should we should do a kinda evaluation
in the streets like asking to young peoples well do you like to have a banana as a remote control
yeah
mm hmm
yep
any any new ideas we could uh we could investigate next time dunno oranges
hmm
okay very good
so
well done i think we we can go
home yeah maybe maybe we can hassle the the
production department to to make a a real prototype that we can use at home to to evaluate
okay so thanks very much bye

yeah so uh following our decision to uh
make a yellow well to make a banana
remote okay so
we actually have a
we've well first first of all we made a an attractive base station uh with a banana leaf uh look and feel um and uh
bana sit the banana sits in there k you know nicely weighted so that it's not gonna tip over and um this is the remote itself it's kind of it's it's ergonomic it fits in the hand uh rather well we've got the two uh
uh scroll wheels here which you know one on the the left for the uh volume and the one on the right for for the channel
and uh underneath we have the uh the turbo button which is in like a nice uh trigger
position for you know for pressing quite naturally
this is when you when you uh are scrolling the uh through the channels you can tell it to to skip th past channels that you quickly rather th
yeah well when you stop scrolling the wheel it stops but normally with uh it will just uh s stay on each station briefly so you can see the the picture
the t v  yeah the s the turbo button so rather than having uh an extra button for um for the on off switch you just use the turbo button
this is a teletext button so once you press that then you get teletext and you can use the the channel selector scroll wheel as uh
to navigate yeah
yeah
well then you can you you have like a little uh number selection thing you press the the the teletext button uh to move between uh the fields and then you can just scroll the number back and forth so you have s you go you scroll to seven and then
zero zero and then you can uh
well you can you can press press the teletext button and then you then you can you can f
mm uh
and this is the uh the infrared uh port
also the top of the banana so and then we have in the uh in the base station we have the the button at the front for uh for calling the uh the banana
actually they do that's that's yeah that's uh that's form and function in the one in the one uh object

yeah so
but yeah that's um that's just like that's an attractive um base station
so
okay
it's it's uh it's about the weight of a banana
you know to give you the correct look and feel

i think a child would try to eat it anyway so maybe we should
consider that maybe health and safety aspects

yeah
i don't really know if the solar cells are actually necessary any more if you have a recharging base station
if i was gonna place them i'd put them on the on the top here since that's like uh the black bit but yeah i don't i really don't think it's necessary to have the solar cells anymore
mm
the what sorry
what do you mean
ah
ah
a long time
no no no it can it should be weeks
yeah but y people don't like to put it back in the base station all the time people leave wanna leave it on the couch so
ah okay okay
yeah
it seems to be falling over
or can move between positions in the in the number
it's all automatic
yep

uh


yeah uh five
five maybe maybe maybe six it's it's i guess it's yeah

i'd give it a six like i'd i think it's probably more handy than my current remote 'cause of the scroll wheels but
maybe loses the point for not having you know the extra buttons when you reall if you do need them for
some reason but you know you can always use your other
remote
yeah

well it depends when you say functional do you mean it does what we want it to do or d does what it does you know can it make you coffee
you know
yeah
yeah
that's before
yeah i have to say four
well it's not a universal remote remember we're focus we're supposed to focus just on t v s
well all t v s but only t  only t v s i guess
four
just four obviously there are some outliers so

which
i'll say five
yeah
s yeah
'cause it's five five seven seven so
uh okay definitely easy to use
seven

alright now here's the sixty million dollar question well twenty five twenty five euro question
what do you what do you guys reckon
hmm

uh
yeah yeah
i'd say two i don't want a banana on my living room table a banana remote
it is handy it's handy but it it's terrible yeah
yeah but it's not a positive thing
well you know it's it's handy it's ergonomic but it's a banana
yeah but it says i i would buy this so
no it's i i would buy

s s
still i i'd say two i don't think i at any stage in my life i would want a banana remote control really
i can say maybe there is a market for it i dunno yeah
okay so it depends if uh
if i had t if i had to spend twenty five euro
if that was like my limit maybe i would buy it because the other twenty five euro remote controls are probably gonna look
worse than a banana
and it yeah this is gonna f you know handy to use
although it still has it still has the word of course at the beginning so i dunno um
i'd give it i'd give it a
i give it a four now

yeah
i'd say three i mean my remote control is kinda at home is pretty terrible
if it was change my remote control of my d v d  player for a mando banana then i would be more inclined to
but uh 'cause it's really bad but uh i'd say a three


it's not very promising but you know
we're not young trendsetters
is there some some formula you're using that says you have to sum them up
well just leave it at that then
no i think it it kind of you just lose information if you sum it so
well we decided against the solar cells so
you mean charging it by shaking the banana
well maybe dynamo is like you have to actually

yeah
well actually that that no that sample speaker is not we we're not using that we're just using the the very beep simple beep that s that sample thing is like the voice recording and everything so
yeah i say that
yeah

mm
well wait a second no it's it's double curved it's got a c it's uh
well d yeah it's monotonic but
it's got but if you hold it
if you hold it that way that's two curved
one on this side one on that side but they're opposite sides
this is actually i mean this probably
this probably actually costs more than three if you
yeah
well no didn't we say we wanted to do a rubber
if you drop it
well when okay well we we'll come back we'll come back and see if we can fit it in
yeah
no we have two push buttons
huh
uh
okay it's gonna have to be plastic
it's a recharger thing and uh
well i actually did um
think about it myself but i thought you know because you could potentially you know you could be pushing it down as you scroll it for a instead of a turbo button but you know the turbo button does add that extra class
you know so i mean if we're if we're over budget then maybe we could we could rethink that
yeah
no we're not we don't need anything special for the buttons
make it plastic instead of rubber and then we're basically o on budget except for you know ten cents
yeah
yeah well pl the base station is made out of m many units of plastic
does that include charging circuitry and everything
so what do we do with the extra profits
okay the next fruit
no we have a product which none of us would buy
no it's people in in in milan and uh in paris that are gonna buy it we're n yeah we're not in milan or paris
actually there were a lot of

that's 'cause i'm sick of milan
okay so um project process



yeah
i dunno i think we had a fair bit of creativity
and uh but i think one thing we m missed out of this whole process was a um like a focus
group with the actual people we're targeting we needed some of these kind of young
trendsetters to come in and play with the banana and you know see if they
see if they like it
because yeah the evaluation for us is is kind of
pointless
yeah
because it it would also be interesting to uh you to know find out if we have a market in really young children as well to see you know how to how to market this thing
'cause you know if well i mean maybe you don't wanna give all your kids their own remote because they'll be changing the channel all the time but
you know maybe in some households where there is you know a t v  for each kid then you know banana
remote control could be fun for them as well might have to draw a face on it
so but i think that's something we need to to work on next time is really finding out more about the target
market

yeah i think there are ways we could maybe simplify the
well just the the the circuit board that we're using inside i'm not sure really how complicated our um
our needs are i mean all we have is two push buttons and two scrollers do we really need an integrated circuit to
you know to process that
and also fo you know for mood lighting and and stuff that would be rather cool i think that's actually something that should
be in version two is the ability to you know to control things other than the
t v  and not just electronic equipment but you know the whole environment of the room
yep
okay thank you
okay so we can go to the slides yeah
number three oh number two sorry
so final design final design
okay so
michael you can go ahead
you can pull it out first maybe
uh
and we we do have one more functionality if you take the banana as such and uh you press the turbo button so it switch ons the switch ons the t v 
the turbo button
additional button
that's right that's right

so then then both the scroll buttons they are for teletext browsing
and you can tele yeah once you press the teletext button then the scroll buttons they are more for teletext they are no more for channel or vol volume yeah
that's right
yeah
yeah
yeah
so it always means whatever the rays goes by they they get reflected and then you are having a better coverage it's like antennas
and for the power source we are having solar cells and rechargeable batteries and this and uh the basis station is going to have the input from the mm power line for for charging the batteries
it is very light
yeah and we have put these different colours so that people don't mistake them mistake it as a banana otherwise it's you know a child comes and so
yeah
mm hmm
oh we didn't think of that yet yeah
oh yeah that's right
mm hmm mm hmm
it'll it'll be always at top somewhere at there
yeah because now we are having rechargeable batteries so that that is
eight to ten eight to ten hours
n most no most of the time it's not being used
so when when you are making it on
mm
mm hmm no eight or eight or ten hours of working if you are just leaving like that it'll be much longer
yeah that's right
yeah
and we are having the speakers regular chip for control pricing is was a factor so that's why we have gone for a regular chip only not the advanced chip
and uh that's it
that's right
you want to have more functional buttons
you are not convinced
not not many we we want to keep it simple so that this button fo is for teletext which is usually also the case that usually there is a teletext button and once you press that the channel buttons they baco become the scrolling buttons
it's up to you means now that
means let's say this this can move the the larger digits and this can move the smaller digits
that's right
yeah so there was there was a constraint that the surface area which we have on this banana on one side because of the shape
so we are targeting a segment which is which is just very trendy kind of thing they they don't care about the buttons any more
and anyway



evalua yeah
why this strange factor of seven
usually i have seen that scales are from one to ten
okay
okay mm hmm
okay
okay fine got the idea
okay
okay okay great
okay yeah yeah go ahead
mm hmm sure
okay yeah yeah yeah
so you can say fancy
handy
handy
yeah it's fancy according to me

seven seven by me
okay
so you can add seven plus six plus seven plus
five
again i'll give seven
yep
seven for me
i'll give five

that's right that's right
the standards what is available in the market off the shelf
we
five
so four point two four

there i'll give it seven
that's right
for a t v  the most important feature which i felt was the locator which is a cool feature and then the scroll buttons are again cool features we don't have l c d  for it but
that we decided we don't want to have
mm hmm seven
okay
definitely seven

okay
i'll say five
i'll say five

why
no but it's really handy actually if you see it's it's so handy and then
anyb anybody who comes here anybody who comes to your home he'll at least ask once what is this
it's a very positive thing if you see like that
youngsters

you want to flaunt you with your girlfriend or something
or might be it does some other kind of thing but
uh yeah crazy

i say five
and you have saved it
you'll have to reload
they're not going to be as
and they they might not be a as easy as this yeah
yeah
s
i go slightly up six

six five four
okay
i'll still give it five
yeah
so it's somewhere three point five i think
no i said five
mm hmm
oops
yeah it's it's funny
yeah sure
mm hmm
solar cells yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah we said no to that
i think rechargeable batteries will take care of the power thing yeah to bring the cost
yeah
yeah
okay
so we have the regular chip on the print which is one
and that's it
and we have sample speaker yeah yeah the cost of that is very high
uh huh
mm hmm mm hmm
and we have sev
yeah so we we'll put some extras if there is something
okay to reduce the cost it's okay
oh it's got all the directions so don't worry
it's got a direction
okay okay
yeah that's right
we don't have any push buttons
no that is a scroll wheel itself it'll be put in that
ah okay okay
okay okay
yeah
no there's no chip there it just emits the signal and the receiver accepts it and that's it
just se sends the signal that's it
yep no
yeah so first thing which we should take care of is
instead of rubber let it be plastic
and uh that much money will be required for the base station which is not there
yeah
that's right so might be ninety centimes for the the remaining things which the cord and everything which'll go
that's right
yeah


s
detachable battery



they like that
mm hmm
biased
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah the cost of the thing can be made more than might be because i think it's just the optimal what we have done for the cost which we are looking forward to
interface
mm hmm
mm hmm mm hmm mm hmm
that's right
yeah
integrate
mm hmm
so
what else
okay
home happily satisfied
mm hmm
thank you

what this button for
okay
but if you want to go to page seven hundred
how man
i don't understand it can you repeat it
yeah
ah okay okay okay okay okay
okay
i see i see okay okay

is it really weight is it light or
okay
okay
ok
okay
yeah yeah yeah i see i under i understand
how long the how long the bit the batteries long

i l yeah
i like i like it maybe the the thing that convince me the less is the the multifunctional buttons looks a bit
looks a bit puzzled uh i dunno how to say that you the the b the buttons change h h their function depending if y it's teletext or not
and the volume button will will become
and what about people who want to use digits butto real buttons

okay because have you thought about configuration and all this kind of uh stuff
it's all automatic okay okay yeah it's fine w we are living in a wonderful world
automatically configure

yeah
s
yeah
yeah
okay i i const i constructed a a list of criteria
based on the on the general user requirements and each criteria is
will be evaluated it's uh logical criteria so we must
users must say i if it's true or is or if it's false in a in a scale ranging from zero to seven
because i
i'm sorry sorry
ah yeah it's from sorry it's from one to seven it's from from one to seven sorry because it should be an even
it should be an even uh scale and five
is too short and nine is too long
i'm a i i'm
sorry
yeah yeah
the variance is mi it's is minimal i'm um answering your question okay
and that's the criteria i i found more useful i think i sh i i could write the criteria
in the on the whiteboard and we all four could range
could evaluate the

okay let's let's evaluate if it's fancy or
seven but
i would say seven it's quite fancy
six
six
i would say
everything ar
mm everything
it's compared to the all
remote controls
actually i don't know what are the r the real specification of a of a universal remote contro
ah it's not an univer but it's for all kind of t v s
yeah
four four
so four

it means cool features like
new features actually
i would say five
you said seven
five
sorry i have them
of cour of course the most difficult question for the end
i find it quite cheap actually i dunno if i i it depends if you live in in switzerland or you live in
i don't know wha the initial specifications were for the whole all europe or
yeah this is the the initial specifications
i would say six it's quite cheap actually

actually maybe
yeah
i change the question
so yeah upload the
yeah it's two different situations if you really need an universal remote control or if you
would change your remote control for a n for a new one

so what now what range
six
six six
six so it's uh five point five or less

actually yeah i we

five
you are romantic really i would say two
who is the outlier wh wh you said five
i don't know if it's a
no because there are more yeah we shouldn't sum like that
because the the last two questions is much more important than the rest actually otherwise we wouldn't we will not sell
uh no i didn't anything
yeah the uh
yeah
do you want me to sum o i think it's not
s

actually what's the differen
too expensive
actually whe whe when you wrote regular chip you should put two because there is another chip here
yeah but
you need
fo i it does nothing actually



okay so now we have a product which nobody would would buy would yeah would buy
yeah because th th the evaluation project
ah would buy yeah massively yeah
yeah okay
uh you have been in milan a couple of times so and you said the lowest
yeah for the batteries


mm hmm
so more general remote control instead of just focusing on uh on t v 
the complexity shouldn't be much higher
for you said if it good for d v d  then i would


bye
the show must go on
you can say then you
it i th i thought it was called pas so i think just use this
pas yeah yeah

mm hmm mm
well i suppose uh i suppose they can capture things right i mean don't s i don't see why you could not capture the videos i mean with a card like this
i don't know i mean i don't know
well as far as i as far as i know i mean they do of course they can do of course slide detection change
slide change detections which uh of course what i understood is also they try to recover the layout
somehow i mean given the slides but they are in no case they are extracting the text from the
slides so with in uh in uh all the cases what i've seen in all the cases i've seen i mean they s assume that
at least you have like a p d f  version of the document or what and basically they try to match what
is displayed
to the document so first they need to extract the information from the document which is not does not seem to be so trivial
at least for uh because they're also working with uh maybe more complex documents with images and
text and so on maybe with slides it's ea it's easier to extract uh the information i assume it's ea it's easier indeed
but they uh assume basically uh that they have this document which is something somehow we would like to relax
uh because uh people uh like in it's you may not want each time to ask the person
maybe the person has a point point not the not a p d f  version or maybe he's using excel to do
a demonstration or something like this and we'll want to avoid this
mm
mm
but but most you would say most most of the points for us i mean would be valid i mean slide transition
we would use slide uh need to do it slide transition to some extent we would like to extract some elements of the layout
to disting to have a more high analysis but we would like to do this more automatically and
in particular for the text recognition to do to be able to do retrieval uh of slides or
points i mean of parts of presentation we would like not to have to rely yeah to a first p d f  version or
any version of the document so yeah
so the c you have bought this card right i mean you say this is a card no no
yeah but i mean this one is the i v c  okay so what i want to say is on this
card there are four inputs right okay not n so enough uh well yeah yeah i was
thinking to some extent nothing would would prevent us uh from also acquiring the slide
but really the slide stream from from this card indeed right or
yeah
okay to capture the slide yeah okay
well i mean just because we cannot rec uh we can w something we cannot do with uh it seems for with the high q quality uh capture uh device is to have a stream i mean the stream right the full stream
so we can tape snapshots so basically it might be interesting to have still um
uh the s uh the slide stream so that for instance if we detect there is a new video that is displayed also on to some extent
we could just cut this videos to keep it and to be able to replay it uh later on and so on
and maybe indeed if for instance the slide stream on the on the right is automatically synchronized
with the other parts of the video it may be easier to s to uh synchronize directly
by some some matching process the slides the high quality measures we have here we've directly
yeah yeah yeah
yeah exactly yeah
so at least uh this is not at the electronic level but you would say as a contents from the content level doing an alignment
from the slide stream and from the snap shots we would have on the other side w is something that might be possible
of course if we have some you know some constraints given by the electronic i mean it's that's better
uh because of course first the process is going to be easier and it may be just a few signals that we have to align
on the other parts but i think i could see i could imagine that this could be a reasonable process
to do and it especially because this would solve some of the issues regarding i mean like the possibility of d of
displaying videos after from from what we record so yeah
well this is more or less what we just discussed right if i understand
so like the diva project is a tape free already smart meeting room huh
okay but this can be done automatically right i mean is the okay
so at t n o  they have something
ah okay okay yeah okay no no that's what i was thinking
yeah so currently because there is a time code uh video time code you don't care about the frame dropping i mean because anyway in each in the video signal it is encoded the time right

yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah mm
okay
well but you don't i mean at this point you don't really care because
i mean in the signal you can extract the time i mean the time stamp is i in the signal so if you drop some frame
which happens sometimes when you do compression or acquisition uh you you uh ev you will
automatically find this in uh the signal right i mean it's encoded in the in the image so you can
you can do it otherwise uh if there is some frame dropping you have to rely on
the number of frames you are counting more or less i suppose to to assess it uh so you have you have some
problems then yeah okay
which i which was more or less t n o 
s problem
with respect to frame dropping right
yeah
well i think if it was not a problem of frame dropping the alignment would have been quite easy to to do and the
really well so it was not such a difficult process then
yeah but if it's only to find uh one of set you have to find some exa some examples but i i had the feeling that they had also some frame dropping that was uh no
okay okay then that's fine
yeah but maybe there are already some machines you know uh uh
uh
yeah i mean just that you know if of course you don't want to have a c other libraries that may you know conflict
with the one you are trying to use at the same time yo see if you crash a machine i mean because you are doing some test you may
not want to have what's on your machine i mean to uh to be
to be uh de erased or whats whatever so i think it's so maybe there is a machine i don't know
whether for this you need you know a very powerful machine and so on but maybe there is a possibility to use a current
machine which is only u yeah that's is withdrawn from the network or
yeah
the card
yeah but still i mean even if it's done on the card you need to basic thing you need to check is um is a bus right i mean the bus writing i mean the speed of uh the bus
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so c p u  itself may not be so
the access yeah
so can we expect a christmas uh gift uh

mm

for instance i mean the test of looking at their entry goes point by point so looking at their code i mean uh so you said you would look at this right or is it okay
'kay
well uh
because i mean i mean the i v c  system i mean it's uh i so my feeling is that i mean
people have expertise in this like in fribourg also so i mean i don't think it should take a lot of time i mean just
to look at this right i mean at least one month seems to be uh quite enough for this right
yeah yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah because anyway this is what you are working on right is the i v c  but using the signals that are coming i mean so basically it's using the i v c  okay
okay so currently you are not working on this
okay then we need

yeah that that's that's so that's one of the issue i mean that uh maybe uh i don't
know w whether you realise but of course if we have this in two years maybe okay it's good we have it but
of course it's it's on the it's too long i mean in terms of in term of research in terms uh maybe even in
terms of innovation i mean if you think about this which is you know what uh they said i mean he was speaking
about innovation this is probably one an innovation
and the the i know i'm we we see quite well why is working on this right but in two
years you know if we want to do if we want to build a c t i  or transfer technology and something like
this you know maybe you c of course okay people will say yeah but there is already something that people have started to put on
the market and so on so it maybe not the it's it's too late uh to to do it so i think
this is really so this is one of the points respect to research of course it's i think
it's going to appear more more and more and uh
yeah
mm
yeah because when when you say here now no i'm not going to start to working on this before january for me this surprises me to some extent you know i'm uh i thought i mean you would you would be working on this so if you say okay now it's uh yeah
no uh oui
no i mean the point is that olivier will r you have i mean s since one year uh you have always been saying that you
want to be involved in this and so on so it seems that it has never been a priority so that that's uh that's the point so if you
have no time to put priority at some points and this seems to have been the case during one year on this project
i mean you need to say it now i mean that's the point now
so this is franck
at least uh say this to us and we'll see uh with franck and again i mean this is a question so now you
are saying you have no time so now you say to us so now we understand and we are maybe after when
we if we discuss with franck uh franck crittin or uh uh frank uh formaz and we'll see okay and go and try to
see okay apparently uh he has no time to to work on this so we think
it's important and we'd like to to do something so what kind of solution as alexandre mentions i do we need to take somebody
do we want to do we need to take some intern to work on this uh and so on and so on do we take to have uh
somebody uh for contract even if it's not an intern but take somebody for six months to work on this
i mean but so this a point i mean uh y i don't know about the other projects you have to
do i don't know with who you are discussing about the time you are you can s uh s spend on each of the project
but if y because now you are just telling us you have no time indeed to work on this right okay
so so okay yeah but i mean c it's yeah but
well i mean uh i mean you have people that are aware of uh m f c  i mean
i mean people uh i suppose at h u v  there are some people uh where i was in le mans in the u  b  uh
i mean there uh would be obviously some some students uh that would be aware of and that could be able
to handle this i mean they are working with software and hard both our software and hardware uh i'm i'm sure
the s se
because uh so so olivier says it's not before january on his side so i'm not sure about uh on your side whe what's your yeah
like what one day a week uh something like this
but
because uh because there are there are several issues i would say like if there would be a machine like this with the two cards separated as i mention
i mean if we record le the flow of the video for instance and the snap shots from the slides to some extent there is some possibility
of doing some automatic alignment without having a special you know synchron so this means that to some extent we could
have a device which would not yet be fully synchronized and i don't know we've uh you
know very well done uh code in terms of sending signals and so on but that might be sufficient
because i mean it synchronize up to don't know five seconds and you would say five
seconds may seem a lot for audio and video but maybe f respect to slides and the rest is not
is something that may be tolerable so still we would be able to start doing some recordings and maybe uh
doing even the automatic alignment or at least we would have an idea about
you know what are the problems in terms of alignments uh do do because it's not like with microphone arrays where you would need micro second
alignments of course uh or even maybe with we want video where it may be one or two frames i don't know
so this is really some somehow i mean the uh the the issue i mean i'm sure that there are plenty
of possibilities to do things and the goal would be that indeed we could start uh
rec doing some of the recordings of the time so that indeed we would already we uh we would have uh
something where uh we could uh start getting the data because after i mean even if it there we cannot
put all the times in one week right i mean so and uh so i mean this is uh
this is one of the issue as well which is to have it so that we can play and we can make a nice demo and so on with
the full uh thing and something so f the other part is to have a system which from which we can already record
data and with some approximation
and i have the feeling given the descriptions that you made that to have such a system wouldn't require a six months of work
because basically their own code is there to some extent and uh the i v c  is something quite standard
from which we could ask i mean even we could even pay maybe pro some people from fribourg i don't know i mean to come
here and to and to help us with the installation on a computer and uh and uh to
to to get the so i have more the feeling that this is something that could be done almost in one month
again i'm not speaking about the synchronization i mean as
yeah i mean the two yeah yeah
yeah the for instance a simple question maybe you can are we sure that it can work on a single computer i don't know
i don't know i mean is there any uh issues with respect to this so this is yeah
so it doesn't require it it's more testing it does not require so for this we i mean if you put the two cards on the computer
you put the two then you you basically you say play on the both sides and you look whether at the end you have uh a recorded
signals which is is is uh the time that it should uh be and uh or whether i mean the fact that
whenever i mean the slides is doing some uh processing uh it there is some and there is some frame drops
or things like this
so this is uh
ah
mm hmm
i'm i'm wondering whether still we could ask for to get an intern for this
i mean uh
yeah this is uh still uh even even the non diploma work i mean the things we could ask uh but i would yeah yeah
yeah
mm
well you
yeah that's that's the issue yeah well but yeah
yeah
okay
i think it's
uh

sorry i don't have my presentation
um
yeah
so they're on my they're on a
no no they are
yeah no no my d  machine
yeah
okay
just going
mm hmm
okay
okay so uh uh yeah i will do something like that
okay so uh i would like just to review at the different project regarding
acquisition system so basically there are five systems the first one is called smac
which is developed by fribourg and cern the second one i is your system uh i would to say
the cheap meeting room system the third one yeah maybe i can share that with you
the smac yeah should i write
okay
the first one is yeah i will call that a 
smac which is develop by fribourg and cern the second one b 
which is uh i would like to che say uh cheap uh meeting room or i don't know
okay
p a s 
okay p a s  the third one is um
okay the third one is called uh the s um this is uh the smart meeting room develop at fribourg which is called the smart
it's diva
okay
the p diva
d i v a  something like that the third
one is call uh the third one is uh the project that i have to improve the current smart meeting
room at idiap uh for that we will use um uh
yeah a tape three uh okay let's call that
and the last one i would like just mention just to for the meeting and this is uh the fire wire um
i don't know if you saw my presentation during my turn you did you
uh okay e  which is firewire

okay so i will start just with the smac so maybe i draw line here so the smac
the smac project the smac project is a project which aims to
do the acquisition of audio video and slide uh for presentation
yeah this project is done with fribourg and cern but i'm just going to
make a very short um graphic in fact they use um
a card a video card which is call um i v c  mm
yeah i just write i v c  in fact this is a video card with four
um inputs
on these four inputs you can have only video but uh they want to make also the slide acquisition
so on one input they put um a conversion box
a converter which converts from slide
to video so that mean that we decrease uh the the quality we have a high quality in slide
and we go to low quality to lower quality with uh video um
so this one is just for the smac now i will just move d
yeah these one are just for video and audio you can use uh them and this board does uh the divx compression on the fly this is uh the box that we have on the table the the card that we have on the table
uh i think
mm
okay so the solution to that low quality is uh solved
b by you project the pas project uh uh i make a tick here and i clean up this
is just to to solve that pro that problem regarding the slide and the slide resolution so
we remove uh that part
and we call that the pas
and in that case we use um a frame grabber here and we go with the slide here
and um of course these two cards will be on the same machine and uh we have
to develop a solution here the main critical point is here the synchronisation between these two
uh these two cards and with that this is the card that we use
in the smart meeting room and this is uh the card the um
yeah these one no no th uh this one is and this one the video card and this one this is uh the card that we have already at idiap for the sli
yeah yeah
yep
yeah
yeah so
okay yeah yeah yeah so we can have both we can have the slide from the slide capture
and we can just use uh a video signal to to capture that
also to have two t uh mm you wants to ha do you have two quality h high quality and
yeah we can just take some snapshots yeah
yeah
yeah yeah
yeah
yeah with um this one so yeah you won't yeah
yeah yeah something like like say something like that
yeah
yep
yeah yeah ch yeah
video
yeah
okay so uh i was just talking about the pas project maybe i would like just now to talk about the diva project so i clean up

yeah
i
there
um did you read something regarding the diva project
in fa yeah uh we just remember that here we we still have only one machine to do uh the slide video and audio acquisition and the diva it was uh something different fact we have a master machine that's um
we have a master machine here and we have some slaves machine here
we have some connection and here we have some input we have audio usually we have audio and
and the same for this one and um basically on the slave machine
we have two cards one for audio and one for video so they develop something to synchronize
these two cards together and th uh this is something which is it's more w
which is call uh direct show
uh which allows you to to synchronize uh these two cards together and but of course
you want these two streams to be synchronize but you want also these two streams to be synchronized
so they have a synchronization between two slaves which is done by the master here we just use
uh the et ethernet network to synchronize uh these two um
these two device um i just write
internet something like that and uh they do only audio and video uh they don't do any slide um
slide acquisition yeah okay so yves asked for the diva i would like just to talk now regarding
uh the the fire free smart meeting room at idiap
do you have any question or uh what yeah tape free sorry tape free
smart meeting room so for that i
yeah it's yeah it's a tape free but also video uh and the acquisition is done in raw
video so the file is huge and they really need uh um they have a
long post processing to convert raw file to uh divx or to our own files
yeah but it takes time it it's just just to mention that uh so
i will write
yeah yeah yeah
okay so maybe first i will just describe the ma the smart meeting room that we have at idiap
in fact we have uh also a master slave architecture um
i clean a little bit
we have the master p c  which take ks uh which takes care about the audio
i clean that and we have the slave p c  which take cares about the white board and the slides
now if we look at the video
if we look at the video in fact um yeah maybe first i should mention that between the master
and the slave we have um the mm a synchronization
signal which is call time midi time code i just write midi
and for the video we have the video input here we re use the um midi signal
uh with um to insert the time code on each frame and we save that to d v  recorder
uh i i have video
okay uh we know the problem of that that uh this is that after
each meeting somebody has to take care about the d v  tapes and to t convert them into divx
so my idea is to d do something like that is to develop a s um
um uh a video slave machine may i say something like that yeah a video slave machine uh which use the midi um which use also the midi time code
no sorry sorry i'm doing something wrong
we have the video here we just have the time code inserter so we take that signal here
and we move to this uh machine here which is in fact just uh the i v c 
video card this just an acquisition card and we com and we s and we convert file directly
to divx and um so we will have here video
and also because we want to control that machine we use also the midi time code the
midi time code to start and to stop the machine this is just something uh that uh this
just to remove the d v  recordings but um yeah just uh this just
an improvement of the smart meeting room okay uh do you have any question uh regarding
uh that
yeah we don't have to care about the synchronization in that case because the time code is ins serted
here and we take after the time code insertion we take the video signal and we pass through
the machine so uh this is uh a simple solution but um where we don't
have to care about the synchronization
co yeah the synchronization is yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
okay so the f last one is uh the fire wire acquisition uh i just
okay
okay um in fact the the major problem regarding acquisition system is always
the synchronization and for that fire wire is good i mean fire wire was a project
now the project is uh stand by uh we don't move
to that project i am but i am just going to talk about this one um so with acquisition
with acquisition systems uh the major problem the major problem is uh the synchronization and fire wire
gives you some um some way to be synchronize in fact
uh this is uh i just want to to describe here the bus this uh yeah this
is of the bus where you can send you can send some package and any device we
which wants to send a package a p a packet sorry
should ask um there is a manager of that bus this just of the bus any device which
wants to send a packet has to r to r
uh require some uh band width on the bus on the bus and so after that
he will have that band width and he will always have that band width
so um yeah he will always have that band width
and so we are sure that we will have a synchronize acquisition with fire wire and so
so that mean that um
yeah yeah sorry sorry uh yeah
hardware
it's i it's done by it's done by hardware it's done by hardware
no no no no no and in fact yeah i i as i mentioned before we have a bus manager
and the bus manager send just a flag to say now it's time to give me you data and all devices
which have uh required some band width will send the data so i'm just
drawing something like that this is this kind of signal that the th bus manager is sending
and just after that bus just after that uh signal
all device will send uh the data so we will have the data from a  from b  and from c 
and so on and after the next one we will have again the um
the data from a  b  and c  and so on and so on and so with fire wire we are sure to have a um
an acquisition system now the major problem with fire wire is that that
fire wire is just an kind of intelligent uh a smart pipe a synchronized pipe
we can put what we want inside so we can put raw data or we can send a divx data
or we can send also uh what i uh was presenting in my term presentation
was a h  two six four but in that case we need something uh hardware here to uncode
raw data to a given format of course uh the idea is to reduce um
the band width on the bus also and all data are sent through the master
do you have any quest
yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah
mm hmm
yeah
uh in fact the um slide card l sorry the slide card and the video card are both s d k  so what
yeah both are s d k 
yeah
yeah y yeah
yeah this for that you uh i don't remember by how no but
usually audio audio and video should be synchronized because uh this just an on an audio
video channel so uh they are synchronize um so we can play with the video we can
play with the slide uh and after that and the major point is to m combine both
yep
we we don't have synchronization
we have to find a solution and for that might be we can use uh direct show which is a syn which is a technique to synchronize different device
no no this is just uh an application which i
no no no no no no this not on the card this just an application that runs on the machine
um f i think direct show you can download for free i'm i'm not sure m i should check or
yeah it m yeah
i think the best thing to do is to have a machine just which is only dedicated to to that
because uh if you if you if you if you use a machine which has been already used for something
else sometimes you have plenty of libraries and so you you don't know exactly maybe it would be better to have
just a dedicated machine just for that
just for
okay
okay
mm
yeah
yeah yeah i i oui because
because i think um the video is done the video compression is done on the
on that card and uh i'm not hundred percent sure
but i think the j  peg the j  peg conversion for the slide capture is done also
on the card so we don't need
ah yeah yeah but i mean yeah i was just thinking about the the speed of the computer could be lower

maybe a first so solution will be just to start w with because we need to start with something we
have the slide capture from darren we have um i will work on the video acquisition
for the inpu the tape free smart meeting room so i will start with that to develop some
knowledge regarding that board uh that video board and after that we can combine both
no for not for no no this not for end of next year it's too long and it it's uh it's too long it's too long
for myself i would like to say uh april may april may we should have results
uh no no no uh i mean the um
uh not al almost uh the uh the the uh the complete application maybe some minor will appears
yeah
yeah
yeah yeah uh they have
yeah th it's a yeah but we start with the i v c  we start with the data path uh the the
slide frame grabber and after that is and the question is how to synchroni to to
to make both card working together
yeah
uh i v c  i v c  should go faster
yeah i will uh i'm not currently working on it i will start to work on january on that point so uh but i think
no no i'm not working
i schedule to to work on that from m
yeah but i have also a que
mayb

but i would like to say uh there is many unknown in that project but i would like to say we can make uh uh a schedule
of that project to just to track to just to see if we track the time table if we don't we
we asks for more people maybe h e v s  people to to to be slightly involved in that project
to be to to respect the date
yeah n
yeah
it's too long
no
yeah
yeah yeah
yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah yeah yeah
yeah but uh at the same time i have some other project i i want to finish uh those project first
but for example i have uh i receive some new project i said that i have no time yet i say
i have no time gi now currently i um i say some for some project
you say that you don't have time but people will stay will continue to say no no you will find time just to do
that project the
yeah
currently but uh up to december i don't have time to work on it but i plan already i i
um with i m  two i i i did uh i mention that i will have from
january two thousand six i will have time for that uh i have a
no i will work fully on that on this point from january two thousand six i wi
maybe a good thing will be to make a plan to to we say we we won't set the deadline here we are here we split that part in different segments uh y
yeah
yeah the yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
no
no no no yeah yeah which is really bad yeah i i understand exactly yeah yeah yeah no i understand yeah
yeah yeah
what
yeah but i think yeah that will be good just to have a plan and to have some deadline in that plan and as soon as we we we as soon as we we we are not in time we we we con
yeah
yeah and to improve the system like
mm hmm
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah and we
yeah
yeah
yeah

yeah uh if i if i say until january this is just to finish uh i want to have the deadline at
end of december to finish all my project i want to finish all these project when everything is finished
after that i can move to another one but i don't want to
yeah
no no

uh i i don't know regarding h e v s  i don't know if this is uh still in time but you can have you can ask for a student a d a diploma work
with the lapel
so we i think we organise uh just to to discuss uh

to discuss uh yeah the project alexandre and uh jean marc uh proposed
a about uh capturing uh audio video and slide uh
in a synchronized way and so we will start with uh an introduction
uh i think olivier prepared some slides about uh reviewing uh
current systems and um
and then even if we don't have many things to to talk about just to to start discussing about
clearly the project and also um dealing with our kind of
timing constraints and uh
the u  u s  u  uh u s b  cord doesn't work and you didn't put on the
maybe you can access through the network
if it's on your h 
or it's on uh your d  machine
so maybe we wi we will be able to
should work what
so um w yeah we had
like five slides y uh presenting different systems and mayb maybe you we can do that
at the white board i it's a bit stupid but uh y you know i think you remember well the different uh parts
and uh i'm sure uh we can do that at the white board yeah it would be great to use
the white board
so the the the first one is uh smac okay
yeah maybe yeah
just a review of current systems uh to introduce
well cheap meeting room is the you know mm it's a conference room or
yeah pas alexandre pas yeah
p pas project
smart mediat uh smart minutes but uh i thi diva because a sma yeah smart minute is all the process of capturing the minutes automatically but it's diva we can say
free
mm doesn't matter yeah
and this the three of those are the v the the video
and uh i'd like to add that this c i think it's quite ambitious project because it's with uh the cern and they w
they uh already worked on uh a european project called indico where they they have
uh release deliver a full um kind of conference uh
uh software and uh to to manage uh all the the conference aspects uh
uh we have in a conference automatically and uh i know that at fribourg they installed uh already
in in a in a big uh amphitheatre for students and i guess it's currently working
ah no either just to uh in parentheses uh we didn't choose that um that
solution because they had no um the the slides were not captured
very uh in a very uh precise way that's the point okay
otherwise they uh it's fully automatic or have have you discussed with them did you discuss that
is it fully automatic you don't know
okay
but the p i
but i i it all synchronize and i is it doing all what we want but without the slide uh precision
okay yeah
yeah
and uh okay and we are su and we are sure that in that uh context of smac project with uh um fribourg working on document analysis uh there were not enough precision un enough resolution in the slides
mm yeah
okay
talk conference
mm hmm
okay
mm hmm
okay
mm hmm
to c to capture
mm hmm yeah yeah
yeah different requirements
mm hmm

hmm

so you you would you c you can uh link like this mm hmm mm hmm
mm hmm

tape free
tape free d v  tape free
yes
mm hmm
and that's what you they use more or less in t n o  also they didn't have uh tapes
but with different cards
they had something
for the ami project
hmm
yeah
mm hmm

because the synchronization problem comes from the the grabbing from the d v  tape in in d in d  vix so it's afterwards
mm
oh no it's impossible yeah

mm they didn't have too much fun grabbing the problem is was that it was not synchronized so
the time code was wrong for for the different videos they had the uh uh at
the beginning of the video you if you saw the time code it was six hours ni uh fifty minutes and h there
four hours thirty two minutes so it's it was a problem with the time code
well that's what they did uh manually after the afterwards but they didn't have too much frame drops in fact no they d yeah yeah yeah i'm sure because
well it's manual to to synchronize it the frame
yeah that's what they did
no no because uh we did the software here and it they didn't choo no our uh software
packet
and this is no no no and this is done at the um you have libraries
et et cetera to to choo well uh a all you you are saying about uh asking
about band width et cetera it th when y uh you use a system um hardware
yeah yeah so we don't have to code all the communication process et cetera so
just for explanation
mm hmm
yes
okay yeah so we need uh well this is will be done together t
like in to to try to divide the time uh what do we do um we we don't want today to
to put deadlines you know but um what we have what we can do
and how we will be able to do i was thinking uh for instance uh in th in what we
have um uh because i don't know a lot about um using
uh like uh d l l  m f c  uh uh microsoft software
but i'm very happy to to go with that and uh so what we have until now
is the software that darren did for the frame grabbing and
and actually i c um i can start playing and uh looking at the
this uh in detail
so darren software
about um frame grabbing
sup i suppose m f c c  no uh not m f c c  but m  e m f c  you heard of that
and uh d l l  et cetera the all the windows uh uh pro programming
um so this is one uh step then um the audio video
card um so so uh first uh
we need to look at this to look at the demos that are uh i with the what they call
the s d k  uh software development kit
uh demos test um testing the card with uh only one audio for instance and then only one video
and e even uh testing with only the slides uh to capture all the uh like what you were saying the the s uh the video s uh stream well slide stream
the frame
you mean the frame grabbing card yeah

they have s d k  uh software development kit that is based on uh m f c  libraries and c  plus plus libraries
okay okay so once you we've tested the
individually the card we can test to synchronize the audio and the video together or
is it no it's synchronized or okay
okay
okay and the i th now we are as you said uh what not now but uh
the next point would be to use that card with the other card and to merge the slide signal
with the well um the s uh yeah the synchronization signal coming from the
frame grabbing card it's uh it's it's not a synchronization signal it's a slide with a t
oui oui yeah we will
and is is it external to this card it's external or it's i
so it's external it's not in this uh card
and we don't have to buy that or well uh to to uh at least the basic
okay and that will will uh will be will help us to synchronize the this frame grabbing card and this video card
so uh t yeah we need to do some tests reading and yeah okay and then when we have okay
where do we do that he we don't know yet with frank if we install this card maybe here
okay and at idiap it's possible there
okay
mm hmm
well on my machine his machine or this machine maybe
yeah
yeah

okay
issue
so yeah uh uh mm
yeah christmas two seven no no um yeah that's good question

yeah alexandre did not care too much about the way uh you i no no no but uh you are more in research
mm hmm okay i said at the beginning of the meeting that mm uh well we're not d doing deadlines but uh yeah mm yeah no no yeah yeah yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm mm hmm

yeah
ye well we would look both at because we are also both uh quite busy with other projects of course uh e h f e s  database uh with j  ferret uh
okay this is between both
yeah of course yeah

ready to be used
yeah so uh
data
mm hmm
yeah we yeah
yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
so yeah let's see from fro for checking darren's code et cetera we can expect until uh
and yeah for o one months or so then uh the uh the i uh i v c  uh
w with the people at fribourg have uh yeah okay so
uh at fribourg we we have
mm hmm
okay and then the direct show or yeah
so we can say we try to to make something for april
but uh well i i want this to to work in the for the time uh in the mm hmm mm
mm
mm hmm
uh i mm hmm
the
mm hmm
mm hmm
o one student or yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
and we can ask help uh
mm hmm
i it's too late in terms of research uh mm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm
hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
no no no no we understand that you we cannot wait uh we were here one year ago uh i don't know and also when it's was uh going uh the idea was appearing and

mm hmm

mm hmm
mm hmm
okay personally i want to be involve in that project a acquisi uh some mm
mm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm
mm
mm hmm
mm hmm
hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
with i m  two i p  one mm hmm
fifty percent on on i m  two that's it
it's fifty percent no on i m  two i p  one okay maybe in fifty percent uh on that
mm hmm
mm hmm
why this was yeah mo yeah w i don't want to talk too much maybe uh but uh with sebastien sorry this was maybe
uh his concern and yeah bastien is busy with uh annotations plus
all kind of things uh maybe we can in the process we
can ask for
someone more
to work on that
well uh uh that's what i i was
y
that's what i was trying to do and i before coming here i just tried to to make uh
uh a plan but i don't answer yeah w well the let's say uh
april o  six and uh we do uh our best with uh trying to keep
you inform with the advancements and if we see early that clearly uh there i
mm hmm
and it should be someone with experience in c  plus plus m f c  uh
yeah or a student
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
no no no
mm hmm
mm hmm
hmm

mm hmm
well i would like to to to work on p kind of part time uh uh w o yeah yeah
and one full day a week and i would okay maybe you won't like my answer
but i would say that um we ch we we start but we h we really have to start on working
wi uh reading all the code from darren then this um
card with the code i v c  card and to to try this then we try a little bit
direct show to see um uh to to
have an idea of how how long uh that could be and then at the moment we can say okay we need
someone to help us

well w uh let's do that let's do that okay fo

mm hmm
mm hmm mm hmm yeah
to
so without direct show you mean the frame grabbing signal and time alignment uh wi that would be done uh in like in common software that we have uh afterwards
okay th and this point is about testing and uh yeah okay
so you could say okay let's for christmas let's try this without the all the synchronization
uh with direct show issue okay oh yeah you are you cannot or o l uh by doing
one one day a week mm you know just i think the cards
okay
anyway the recording is finished i think
yeah
so i try my best until january and um
and i try to do what jean marc uh described to give you a first feedback on the
different cards uh and uh and from there it
would m yeah

yeah
yeah
mm hmm
i would say uh let's let's yeah let's try to have one uh students uh to help us on that
i don't know that is very well we have to choose whether the students it's too it'd be stupid but uh
uh the the student should have knowledge about m f c  with oh okay yeah mm hmm
doesn't mean that we d we have to to stop talking yet but uh the recording has finished
mm hmm
keep going
yeah yeah sure that's interest us
it's okay it should
but for the moment just for the purpose well f for the moment it's just to understand each other so we know we know that the uh
yeah for with pas it's okay yeah good idea
uh this sounds like alexandre pas yeah that's not that

it's diva n'est ce pas something like this yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
i don't know

mm hmm
but l let be careful there's one important point the technical aspects of the way you acquire things should
be driven by the kind of processing you want to have so in our case we need to have a good processing of slides
that in our case it means to transcribe with an o c r  and then make indexing we need to have high resolution image
i guess that's what you mean by precision right so in a sense that's the point for
us we need to have uh this sufficient resolution images of
slides to do what we want to do so that's why i guess we don't follow
that solution because apparently yeah
mm hmm
as far as i know so far uh they did similar works on meetings document centred meetings they always
worked on manual transcriptions of documents so they never really took into account a possibility of
actually performing processing on the document they talk about during the meeting during in this case the
uh the talk the conference the the th the presentation as far as i know
as far as they published i kn i know the results they published uh so far
so essentially they n never took into account i mean the work at the high level which means basically we have the information coming
from here and there and we n created techniques that allow to starts from the text there and
the things that are said and w if we find context i mean they make some kind of processing but as they don't work
on the low level so low level it means basically okay take the speech and extract the transcription i take the image
uh of the document and i take the transcription they basically don't really care of this aspect
as far as i understand mm as far as i know
mm hmm
yeah
exactly
exactly
yeah
yeah

let's say that it makes uh less automatic in the sense that at point you need someone giving the file and putting the file
upload in somewhere et cetera and it is a different kind of processing some way is always driven by w what
you're able to do they work a lot on layout analysis i know they match uh uh the layout in two x m l 
files et cetera so it's a different way of approaching the problem which means a different way of capturing different
exigencies in in capturing the the documents yeah
yep
yeah yep
yeah
mm hmm
i it's the same as as you have in the picture yeah
yeah
yeah yep
yeah yep definitely
mm hmm
mm hmm
acquisition mm hmm
tape free
mm hmm
mm hmm
hmm
mm yeah now basically we have all this kind of general view about all the systems maybe we can take this opportunity
to come back to our system because you know we had there are mm we had the long discussion and finally we
decided for for one approach and maybe take the opportunity to look just a moment uh at what
point we are and w when we plan basically to get something uh done and working i can
add to that list of project is something that jean marc and me we have found in the literature there is f x  that
is doing something very similar to to what we do here basically
a capture through the projector signal of the slides and they for the moment they just plan
to use the slides as a as a way to index the presentations but but uh roughly is is an idea
that is very similar to to our idea so well essentially now we have the material
as far i'm as i'm understood uh and it's up to you to tell us roughly when do you
think uh we're gonna have something working
mm hmm
issues yeah
mm careful because the uh i listened to frank and apparently don't want to buy a new machine before we show that this works so we have to use material that is already available
maybe there is some free ma machine that is not

okay s so it is possible to use other machines actually yeah
mm hmm
mm
some of uh some other machine yeah
mm hmm
so mm in terms of time what we can think
when we can expect to see
christmas gift or
early new year gift uh


but the way of course i'm i i don't know exactly what uh the work involves so is this uh no that's not that i don't care but uh i d i don't understand some way exactly i think the the the real point is when
roughly i mean i i don't say well no no no i don't wanna put a deadline uh but uh given the current
uh material we have um mm given your activities because i know that you both are involve in many
other things so it's something that you yeah as jean marc said is christmas and
uh so we're happy with the christmas gift or is something that you say is christmas two thousand six so i i
i definitely just want to know something very rough on when you expect to finish this
that's problem uh that's that's a problem i mean do you think it's something for the very next months do you think it's something for the end of next year do you think sp
mm so is for so half next year
so june june june two thousand six
re results what does it mean the end of this so it works it doesn't work
you know for for me what is important is when it is ready to be use so when i can say start collecting
data uh i start using i start playing with this basically the process is ready and we can start having our
demo and also because there is a risk that uh we submitted a project maybe it will be rejected we don't
know but potentially we are going to have a student supposed to work in this it will be no not before
april two thousand six anyway but uh you know
mm some way we we we we cannot have a students and make him wait one year before he has uh
the material to work so my point is when
reasonably uh roughly i don't don't don't wanna have and it's not a deadlines oui but when do you expect to have the system ready to work uh working yep
mm hmm
together so this seems to be the main problem as far as as i understand
mm hmm
uh make something re that you are using very vague expression result make something just
just uh just tell me when it is ready and if you think it's it's not before uh but but
must be reasonable i m i mean if you think it will be not before december two thousand six say december
two thousand six so don't try to tell me march or april i w if you already know that
it is unrealistic to say that must be realistic you say june two thousand six we know it is june two thousand six
uh i know
sure sure but
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah well but there is no day to respect it's just to know i mean and if you can have early early warnings
in the sense that if you see that there is a major uh problem somewhere but is just to know in the sense
that really uh this p this mm thing has been stop now for quite a
long time uh uh it n it took a long time to decide what kind of material now we have it it's
something that uh is a pretty good idea we see that other people are working et cetera
we are going to lose it some way if uh if we don't put some
and very honestly yeah
i i it'll it'll not be
this is innovation yeah
uh you know in a sense i never tried for example eventually to ask for one person dedicated to this because
i always had the feeling that you are very interested you wanted to do it it's something you some way you uh
i mean it seems to be something that is interesting to you but uh if you have
not the time and the possibility to do it because you you both are involved in many other things we can eventually try to ask
to have one person to involve one person that will be dedicated strictly to this we can try i mean we can ask uh
uh in the sense that if it is a priority for idiap so far we would get very good signals from that point of view i i don't know
but uh please if you think you don't have the time or the energy to do it uh or it involves
too many things that you cannot keep under control given the other things you have to do
uh don't think that okay something nice we we can wait or sooner or later it will happen
uh yeah exactly so i think it's the moment
uh for you to really realise try to to have a realistic uh date and if you think there are too many things
that you risk to lose control uh tell it now and we can try to say well we want to do it but
uh basically mael and olivier were the person mm hmm no no but but
you can be involve in a different way i mean you can eventually have uh a supervision role in the sense that you think that i i know
how to do it i like to do it but i have no time because at a certain point it's a matter of time we can try
to to ask uh but uh please just don't keep this as a kind of thing yeah i like to do it
i like it it's nice et cetera
yeah
yeah bu but but here you have to take a responsibility you can't say i like to do it and but then ah but i will do it when i can
exactly
mm hmm uh yeah yeah yeah 
okay this is yeah
no no
okay so now is your responsibility to say i cannot find time if you can't find time you have to say it now and this is also for you i mean i it's not an accusation we we are all in the same condition
mm hmm
exactly
mm hmm
s s
so let me pose the question very broadly do you think that we have a person that has this
will help you we can ask we can try to ask maybe if some person for six months so that your role
is simply to help and advise
we can try to ask
i mean
s
i'm sorry but you still don't answer to my my question you are not answering my question yeah
let me pose again the question very clearly if i go to herve i can try and say we are in this situation
apparently why don't we take one person three months six months four months
that directly advised by olivier and uh and we can speed up

consider that it can be difficult of course to find them et cetera and so on do you think it's an option
mm hmm
at each yeah i think there are people yeah

do you think it's a reasonable option do you think it's something that uh can help you because that's just
a matter of responsibility for you guys to but there is nothing bad if you say you have other things to do because we are all uh full
of work this is something that is added on the top uh if you don't have time you don't have time
guys i mean this is uh but please just tell me we will find the time
however so april o  six you will have your system or no we are not sure we don't really know
uh it can happen that we don't we don't know what you are going to find on the way maybe we think it takes one week
and then it takes one month uh w we don't know uh maybe we will s we wi will not able to be continuous because one of
the wrongest thing is to work one week then one month no et cetera that's it's something that breaks i mean difficult huh
mm so that's the point so that which doesn't mean you are excluded f from the thing in the sense that in any case someone
will ask will have to advise the person eventually and it can't be him it can't be
me it can be you that basically follow advise helps but at least the mass of the work will
be done by someone else that can spend a hundred percent of time on that
now it's not even guaranteed in the sense that i can ask this i can say that well this is the situation
and uh you are or eventually yeah someone can say okay now this become
your priority forget about everything else and go with that i don't know or will tell you okay
uh january two thousand six but from january two thousand six you do nothing else than this you know w we can
find the time whether it is your time whether it is the time of someone else but uh i
really would like to stop with this because this has been for several months that you say we like we want and i'm sure
i believe you but then it is always something that must be done outside uh the uh
normal activity um i'm uh i'm sorry yeah but but uh otherwise i mean
as you say to do it in two years p
so what do you think you like that i try to to to solve this problem and try to say that there is a time problem and you don't have the time to do it
okay but that can be but uh
yeah yeah yeah
it can be tolerable yeah yeah
exactly
it's a very good idea yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
yep
uh i no let me
that seems to me clear until january is uh is busy so
so yeah just to go to a conclusion because apparently yeah so it can't work uh yeah exactly can't work uh until january so it's up to you it's up to you to evaluate yeah
mm hmm
and then we d make a decision in the sense whether you continue working or we try to find the time in a different way or we try to eliminate your other priorities you're under hmm
yep
i think that's that's a different problem the problem is really up to you guys whether you think it's good to have one person
try to have that because uh i cannot say we have tried to have
w exactly it wi but better no person than a bad person anyway yeah okay
okay it's a
i think if we both step up and uh
outline our ideas
okay now
do uh doing the prototype gave us a bit more insight into the ergonomics of the design um
for one thing it turned out that the only point at which it needs to be
articulated for handedness is um is h i is down here for
the uh l e d  as it turned out the whole thing transfers from
the right to left hand fairly well from the point of view of operating the uh function buttons and joystick
though it might be an idea to be able to a adjust the positions for the base of the joystick just a little bit
for uh
ju just a thought you could simply have a slightly ovoid shaped joystick
that could then just be turn uh twisted round so that the uh sticky uh so that the
bit that sticks out a bit more is on one side or the other but as you as you see with
the uh with holding it in the left hand the l  uh the l c d  is nowhere useful
so that would need to be articulated
uh if we're going to retain ergonomic design
um now i i got your note about uh keeping the cost down
yeah
this design could be done with um
with uh plastic casing though i would recommend around the grip part here in the middle
having maybe just a rubber grip over that which would allow for a slightly more sort of bio morphic form and a bit more ergonomic
as well as for the um
as for the single curve
um well this edge and this edge like i say it would be nice to have some
curvature to it but it's not absolutely necessary really the curve that's most needed is the underside so that the
jo so that the joystick rests over the the edge of the hand like this
um and you have
the uh transmitter here and a wee speaker for the uh for the uh for the uh fi uh for the remote control finder
so
any further comments
mm hmm yeah
yeah i mean the uh yeah
yeah i mean with the with the rubber design it could i you know it could pretty much mould very much to the
to the user's hand one nice wee feature if we could if we could still do the rubber i though of was to have
the uh rubber extend beyond the end of the uh of
the rigid substructure so it has a wee sort of tail that you just drape over your wrist so it stays in position nicely
mm
lovely um
okay
yeah that's still part of the design
mm
mm and making it a bright colour helps with the personally i would have gone for purple

mm hmm
i'd say number one
i think w if it was just the sounder then th i mean something i've found with
uh w w with say tr trying to find uh a cordless phone or a m mobile
you can hear it but you can't quite pin it dow pin down where it is
bu
yeah
mm hmm i suppose o one thing that could be done is h is have it um circular and have it s so that the uh the pink actually goes a bit over the pinkie finger mm so that uh th
mm
mm yeah
mm
mm i think if we remove the the l c  display then there was absolutely no point to any of these meetings and we just we could just put our branding on any other remote control
mm hmm um yeah i mean one thing i mean ho uh how much extra would it be to to keep i mean keep the um the articulation
this is what i'm wondering
oh no i think i i it d that it needn't require it to be double curved
it's uh it's just it's just it's just that the case would come in t would be made in two parts and then joined together with an articulation
mm yeah i mean and i mean the uh i mean if you look uh if you look closer at the uh at the prototype here the lines here along the grip
are actually quite straight um i mean yeah on the on the
l c d  i mean although we've done it with a curve it could just as easily be done um
without curves the curve that's really needed is up here to put uh to keep the joystick
in a good ergonomic position for it to have it rest on the top of the hand
mm
mm no that's that voice response thing that we got the email about but i thought it was just completely pointless
yeah
alright b i basically it was saying that our labs had come up with a chip that you could you know say hello to and it would say hello back in a friendly female voice

mm hmm
mm
okay well l let's say that and then we can have our special coloured case and then we at least have make it a little
harder to lose because most m most remotes are a fairly dingy colour that gets camouflaged under
any pile of crap in a living room
or grey
yellow

okay
three i think we can do three
th the special colour doesn't would i think make a difference it makes it stand out from you know it's lost in a big pile of crap it stands out from the rest of the crap
two buttons and a joystick
totally
it doesn't get much fancier
mm
mm i'd give it a three for this for that yeah i mean
the menus thing is something you don't normally see on um
on a remote but you see it in a lot of other places
mm hmm
i'd give it a three
mm hmm
i'd s i i'd give it a six to be honest
well i i i would sa i would say give a s give a selection of colours um we went with yellow we went with yellow for the prototype 'cause we had yellow if i were buying one i'd go for purple leopard print would be cool
that's kinda
i it won't be when it's been
budgeted
i i think s i i think this isn't not particularly fruit and veggie um

mm i'd i'd i don't think fruit and veg is the sole criterion
is the sole criterion for being um fashion fashionable or inspired by current fashions
um i'd g i'd rate i'd rate this fairly highly from that point of view actually
mm

mm
personally
i think given that
the product um
only replaces a single remote control that you've already got
are people really gonna shell out twenty five euros for something that's only marginally good

mm hmm i s i suppose one thing is that b because it's technically innovative
um for someone who's sort of technophobic the fact that it simply looks unfamiliar would be daunting
um
yeah got notes and doodles
well i think this is a i think the digital pen's mostly for the benefit of the uh
of the researchers studying this it's all p goes into their corpus though it would have been nice to be able to transfer the um
transfer our n our paper notes onto the uh
computer ourselves
unti uh uh until uh until accounts came along squish
yeah
mm i mean i th i mean i think to r retaining the s the more sort of bio morphic form
in the articulation would gain more in s uh would gain more
profit in sales than it would lose in uh
in added expense
such as it is
actually i want th one thing i would say i mean something that could perhaps be part of the product
mm the um m product testing market research process would be to uh produce mock ups
of both versions and see just how much of a difference the over going
over budget
um m would make to sales
and we could even you know market two versions
wee cheapie version with the nice bio morphic rubber
yes
mm
and i can get my bus
okay
thank you
that should hopefully do the trick um
'kay sorry about the small delay falling a little bit behind schedule and that's uh fifteen twenty five
okay so just to try and roughly go over what we agreed in the last one um
we're gonna go for something uh uh how was it uh the new black i believe um
something that looks good 'cause that seems to be in preference to actual functionality in the end though we should never
avoid functionality of course uh many of our components are gonna be standard off the shelf but it seemed like we were gonna
require at least an advanced chip and we were still very much for the idea of using an l c d  display
um other things were we were hoping to use rubber most likely gonna be double curved etcetera
okay so um due to your hard work we might as well let the uh two designers go first and uh show us the prototype
quite how the best way to do this is i'm not sure but
okay
i'm afraid yeah we'll go into that a bit more but please go on

mm

okay yeah great um
yeah okay excellent work
um

yeah i believe so so i mean i don't think anybody could actually stop a remote being lost 'cause that would mean doing something about the human element but i'd like to think that we've done something about finding the damn thing once we have

mm um
just before we go through all of the steps here um well what we'll do is
um if we can look at the criteria you're gonna evaluate and then we'll come back to the product evaluation if that's alright yeah is that
um so is there anything here that you
that you wanted to cover as in the criteria that you've covered and then we'll come back pretty much promptly to this
i is there any of these criteria that need any explaining or is there anything that yous thought tha really would stand out compared to the others
okay
okay no and which we will do very very shortly
um
okay slight problem we had was that we have an amazing
four euros over budget for what we were hoping to do um
most of it stems from the use of the l c d  which i think in the end accounted for about half of
our expenditure because of course we required a chip as well um the only way to get this down
was either to ditch the a l c d  at which point we've removed a large part of how we
were gonna interface require more buttons etcetera
or what we did was that we um we as in i as i was quickly going over it was
altering the actual structure um changing it to plastic and a solid unit with a single curve
design would allow us to come back into the um proposed costs and we're just
scraping it in we've got point two of a euro left over there so we're just managing it really
even then as well um there was no criteria technically defined for a joystick so i've used what i think's appropriate
with any luck that won't mean that we've incurred more cost than we can actually afford to
it blows a lot of our really good ideas kind of slightly to one side for example the possibility of having a u s b  connection is definitely not viable now um
that should still be viable we've got an advanced chip we've got the use of the l c d  so being able to communicate in multiple
languages is still very much a possibility um but what's something we need
to decide on is how we're gonna go from here we do need to try and come up with an idea which could be continued with
other people if need be um
we can i can bring the excel up sheet up and uh show you if you wish um i really think as m
much as it pains me is that we might have to go with plastic and some kind of solid design possibly meaning
that the l c d  wouldn't be in this perfect place it might be s stuck like slightly between what
would be good for left handed and what would be good for a right handed person
okay
it very much is about making concessions unfortunately um
um b b b da is you mean on the plastic or let's have a look you now have as much information as i do um
so as you can see here for example the battery
really not very little choice in that one we've gone for one of the cheaper options as well unfortunately we require the advanced chip if we're gonna do what we're needing to
i've said single curved we really do need it to be that way for the ergonomics of it um plastic
for some reason incurs no cost which i've had to very much make advantage of despite the fact that rubber's only got a value of two euros per unit
problem comes here as you can see in the interface um
if i've read this thing correctly then we can save point five of a euro here in that it's not per push button
that might make sense because then a numeric keypad would come in at um what four point five euros which is an awful
lot so that could well be wrong even if we save point five there it would just mean that we're most likely placing
it in actually just gaining a colour for the unit which has had to be put to one side as you can see
the use of an l c  display um advanced chip and what would determine the scroll
wheel here as well because it's an integrated scroll scroll wheel push button that wasn't quite what i think they had in mind
with a joystick
i that's something you'll have to take up with the bean counters um
as you can see i mean that's taken up well over half of the price so um i'm very much open
to suggestions of where we go but because we need to shed what was four euros off
of the um the price of for what we really desired
this one comes in under price as you can see but this was the one that sacrificed the material for the
case and for the actual case design
uh no we haven't not
that'll it literally would just be a button we might have to
it looks like almost nothing
mm oh good call i missed that
that's a very valid point
so if we're gonna go with the l c  display then that's
i believe so yeah
that would probably not be in keeping with the um the fashion statement and such yeah
being manipulated by the joystick yeah
which i'm defining as scroll wheel um
yeah it's just because there was no actual definition for what a joystick might be that
that's what i've labelled it for the purposes of this evaluation
if we remove the l c  display we could save ourselves
a fair amount
which you could
it's a shame we should possibly have
if we could've increased the price we could've manufactured that and we could've got something far closer to what we were hoping to
again you'll have to argue with the accountants on that one um but for the purposes of this meeting i'm we're gonna have to stick with these figures
so
i would say that it would seem like the general opinion is we're gonna keep the l c  display 'cause it's about what really separates us despite the cost it's gonna incur um
are people maybe not happy with but are willing to go ahead with this in going for a plastic solid case to keep the l c d 
it's hard to tell um i would say that you're at least gonna take double curved and even then i'm not quite sure if that's incorporating the idea of articulation
single curved with articulation
but the curves all o over hand is it
we wouldn't actually save a lot by reducing it anyway so i mean for the purposes of this meeting maybe we can state
that single curve still allows articulation um unless
we hear otherwise we could go ahead with that proposal
which is what we can get onto now as long as so are we gonna say w we have to keep an eye on the time as well but we're gonna say um single curved design
it could well be but at a cost of
okay yeah we'll definitely won't go with that one
yeah that's voice recognition so
um
so okay yeah battery definitely
it looks like it unless we can manage to put it in under point two euros um
maybe even slight well oh yeah pretty much point two euros i'd say so we'll leave that one for now we'll just have
it's uh a case of um
i'm uh slightly unsure one point five of a euro for one push button doesn't sound quite right so maybe it's a case of a push button is maybe one or more
um
at which point if
well you got point five there it's literally a case of whether or not this is correct i'm not quite sure if they're i don't think they mean point five euros per button
so
there we go
black's probably the normal colour you'd say yeah i quite like that colour that you're fetching there it's uh definitely for make it glow in the dark even better so
will we go with that then
it's not and we can see we'll come back to uh your evaluation which you're probably now going to pan us but there we go
just to give you an idea um you want to go maybe a bit quickly as well i'm not sure how much time we've not hit the five minute mark warning yet but
ten
mm mm four three mm

okay
two buttons
yeah i'd say we're doing well there


mm hmm
as he models the

i'd
yeah
which is a shame
mm
i'd be tempted with three yeah
we'll get panned on the next one anyway
yeah w
it is yeah don't blame them um because of the way that we've minimalised
the number of buttons and such plastic it sucks but it's no worse
than any of the other pl remote controls we have



like yellow yeah it would also help keep the the product placement s yeah is it inspired by clothing fashion

yes
it's kind o it probably
well i mean it's probably more fruit and veg than most other things out there bar fruit and veg so what four
is that being too generous
oh dear
what would you think yourself

well it's kind of curved and we can make it yellow and that's pretty much banana like
si it's got a curve to it
am i do you think i'm stretching the uh the use of the banana
it's not bad and considering the don't pick the pen um
y oh and you've knocked batteries out um right okay it's
considering the price we had to get this in to have a positive you know even based on the four of us being
heavily biased um
it was gonna be quite hard to get anything standing out i'd say possibly based on
um the the cost features
maybe it's been targeted
hide it in the fruit basket
probably the people technologically they're usually the ones that buy pointless stuff
mm hmm
okay um don't know how lo much longer we've got at least five minutes i think um quickly we'll pop onto project evaluation um
so
we've got these uh four criteria here for uh satisfaction
does anybody want to um
um do you have any opinions on any of them for example um we'll work backwards i suppose
the ability to work on this project using the technology we've been presented with
um people made good use of the
uh pen and paper
i would say
i'm not quite sure what the advantage for us using a digital pen might be
mm
it must
it does seem like the paper's still a heavy consideration for taking notes so maybe this is literally just a way around it um i dunno
how are people satisfied with the teamwork we've managed to display today
leadership as much as can be leadered in this uh thing
um last one we've got is room for creativity now i think we got

yeah i think of in the end ideas that can be used sadly
not so much that we weren't full of ideas but of ones that are gonna allow us to actually build the thing it's a bit of a pity
um i would have to agree on that i think we needed a larger budget
if you're going to aim your a um product maybe at the technological kind of sector then you can afford to maybe jack the price up slightly from what it is because they will pay outrageous cash to
first on the market
mm
it could even
that's true yeah um i suppose these are all that will have to be taken up with a at a different group at i guess as to a the costs involved
but i mean
we've got a a prototype
so i dunno i i think it's gone okay today considering the information that we've
had at our disposal and um such
probably would have mean we could have come up with a lot more solid design in the end i would have to agree it is very much
a pity to um get so far into the stage and then find out that maybe some
of your ideas are just a bit too expensive always hard to tell until you know the costs
um
okay are the costs within budget well they are now that we have our slightly less than capable product we've evaluated it and we can say that we came out with a value of three

it's yeah

and then the final one where you get to call it hal but we'll go into that later right
um is there anything else that anybody would like to to add um
anything they think that's not been covered before i quickly write up a final report
um i dunno i mean we've got a product we maybe aren't as happy with it as we'd like to be but
we've got something we think we can maybe stick onto the the market and sell
and of course something we have been avoiding talking about 'cause of we've no information is selling them directly to the manufacturers there is a huge market i mean we've briefly touched on it but we've no more knowledge then there's little we can say on that
yeah
so um unless anybody's got anything they'd like to add we can maybe round this up slightly earlier than we'd need to and then we can finish up the writing and such
yeah
uh thank you for your participation
that a question we can ask
right
yeah i've got a if you load up my evaluation document
mm
uh evaluation

basic point uh have a list of criteria that we need to rate the prototype by um then we will it's a seven s um seven
seven step kinda evaluation process so um not seven steps seven scale
so after we've finished doing all the ratings for each criteria we average that and that will give us some type
of uh confidence in our prototype and uh the criteria based on
real reactions' kinda goals and policies marketing strategies and also those
i put together from the user requirements phase 'kay um if you
flip the
so those are the criteria and uh perhaps i could have put 'em
a bit better but you notice a few things that we've totally abandoned which means that uh
the product will score very badly on some of those points put it mildly so we have um
true
one t
seven eight oh
fourth okay so we have to go through each point if we imagine it's actually straight and just give it a
a score so um how well would you say the prototype is uh
how well have we realised the dream of being able to stop remotes from from being lost or to be able to find them once they are lost
i mean uh is the homing thing still the locator is that still
sure and adam we can keep that in
okay
sure
t
sure
mm bright colour so we still have that noise thing yeah os on a scale of one to seven how would you guys rate it for finding finding it once it's lost
number one okay number number one for the first criteria
yeah you can tell what room the mobile is
yeah
yeah
mm hmm
you wanna say something
that's fine
oh that's that's fine
what do you mean cr is there anything i wanna
um a few

something i neglected from my initial research is that real reactions has a a goal strategy
that all of the products be inspired by material fashion and clothing fashion
that is why fruit and veg being popular in the home and in clothing was important
and they want all their products to be somehow inspired by current trends in fashion so they say we
put the fashion in electronics well they really mean it they they're very big on fashion so
that's this bit right here and uh this bit
is this one easy to use for visitors or for anybody i guess it's just the same as saying easy to use interface
so it's kinda condensed into one and we can come back to it you said so
different languages
yeah

mm
do you have any data on how much um different prints cost i mean can you get the entire thing printed with a design um
yeah yeah
why would why would that be more expensive than an individual push button and scroll wheel together
that's quite significantly expensive
yeah
we don't even have uh speakers here the like uh we uh what about speakers and transmitters and stuff like that have we factored that in
transmitter receiver speakers plus the extra device itself that's gonna be on a t v  is that gonna be a button or
yeah
i i mean it's not on here but um
did they s do we have to use an advanced chip for the l c d  okay well that's yeah
what's a hand dyna dynamo you have to wind it up

technology yeah
okay
and we couldn't replace the joystick right because we would need four extra buttons to replace it up down left and right and that would be more expensive than a but is a scroll wheel not just back and forward
yeah

yeah yeah um uh k
does this does this bear in mind that i mean it's a bit ridiculous that they're gonna charge us
what is it like this much money for three million if we're gonna buy three million components you know
mm
'kay
i think so
yeah
could we could we not get rid of the curvy the curvous the curvaceousness and focus on the menu being the best interface 'cause like we do we have re restrictions on software
oh but there has to be
joystick
okay sure okay my bad
so i think the product is not gonna perform so well for my criteria
oh wait a minute
sample speaker
what is a sample speaker is that somewhat similar to what we want
yeah
you got a email about voice response
i did not so
we won't go with that one did you say i mean i we
okay okay
so it looks like we're gonna get rid of the whole loca locator thing
okay
okay
oh special colour for the case
mm hmm
w what's the default colour white or black
right
yeah
yeah
sure
okay okay so uh
right okay okay
'kay ability to stop remotes from being lost or to find them once they are lost
um okay special colour
uh uh four
three if we're being generous i feel
think we're being generous here with three
mm
yeah okay reduce the number of unused buttons we're down to t two buttons is it
okay so that's a one you know where that's
okay that was good easy to use interface buttons menu menus that's yeah that's good
'kay that's we're not doing so badly um easy to use oh okay let's forget that one
fancy looking
sure and we could do whatever we like with the l  l c d  yeah let's just assume it's a good l c d  display maybe i was panicking for no reason

yeah w maybe you'd be a bit too yeah there we go yeah that's m
that's that's better too more accurate numbers technologically innovative well we're getting rid of the locator thing which which yeah
'kay
yeah mobile phones and y what you're doing is moving the menu from the television to the remote control so it's
you say three i might go as far as two on that three
three okay
okay
materials that people find pleasing sponginess is what they really would have wanted apparently

yeah
that's true it's not a step backwards
yeah okay let's give it a six okay that's totally thrown everything off balance inspired by the latest interior and clothing fashion w we could what colour were we gonna make it

i know but
but um by this i think it's more a case of fruit and veg
yeah
mm
but
th th they're referring to the fruit and veg thing
is this like a banana type colour could we stretch no still it's not shaped like a banana is
oh is that 'cause it's flat what is what fruit or veg is flat
yeah or we might have to suffer badly for this one as well
four oh that's it's very ambitious yeah um
sure
inspired by
yeah
this is their strategy
i m imagine we actually had some money invested in this and the amount that we invest is gonna be proportional to the marks might we might wanna be a bit more skepible sceptical about
this one
i would say i mean it's it's not at all right in any way or shape or form we didn't m
okay the the yellow banana like thing is i think is okay
right five is that sound reasonable
five
yeah
'kay so we have one two three four five six seven
so five seven ten sixteen twenty one
which gives us an average of three
it's well this would be in the middle so we it's it's not bad it's in the good section
oops sorry i'm i'm sorry

mm hmm
yeah
even if we were to increase this entire thing by by seven we were to go down a grade
to to four we would have to do i mean we didn't we weren't that kinda
optimistic too optim overly optimistic you know like we didn't we didn't add we didn't subtract a whole seven points from
these things so i think we're definitely on the good bit even if we gave this one seven and this one seven
that's still only three extra points over seven you know it's yeah we did it w it
was okay it was good
mm hmm
i think so i mean my mum still has not learnt how to use text messaging on her phone and she's had it for a long time you know she uses it to make phone calls and that's it
yeah so i think if sh if my mum saw a remote control like this with only two buttons and a joystick
i mean that'll probably be the first one she decides not to buy you know she'd be like is this a remote control
i don't how do you use it and stuff like that so even if it is really user friendly to us but we're used
to using menus all the time
yeah
yeah i think it's totally uh radical to have a remote control with no no numbered buttons yeah
but like radical good maybe
wrote nearly a page but not
i think tracking
yeah that woulda been pretty good
i'd yeah i liked it yeah
i li yeah top marks
well yeah we we're not lacking in ideas you know it's that was not the problem
mm hmm
yeah
maybe the counts wou woulda been better if we had a list or more
yeah to begin with yeah
yeah
okay
yeah
and like response from consumers

sure

yeah
yeah
yeah
okay let's
thank you
i was actually kind of upset you know at the budget and that we had to cut a lot of stuff it's like man we we can't have the locator thing
and s yeah that's just bad
do you think maybe the prices were were made

um obviously it's gonna be bulkier than how it looks because it's gonna be flat on one side so the l c d  will be s sticking down like this won't it 'cause it you can't get it curved
uh because of costs and it's plastic as well so it won't be as comfortable on the hand
yeah
one yeah

what about what if the the volume on the t v 's turned up massively and uh you just wanna turn down the volume can't find remote
suppose you have to go to the t v  and do it manually mm
like y you wouldn't hear the speaker

mm

that's too expensive isn't it
yeah

fashion
so basically the only new thing is the l c d  on the remote now
oh and joystick yeah
so
the l c d  basically is the big selling point of
the remote
but that's what makes it uh original though isn't it
it can be s yeah it can still be single curved but
you just
that's what we need for the joystick i think though
costs four
yeah
are we going for a special colour at all
well i was for a case
or had you already incorporated that

think it's ten minutes left
special colour
three
are we going one on i'd say we go two 'cause like f the fanciest would be the double curved
wouldn't it
with the articulators
with bells on it
no need for teletext

five six
six
put a leopard print on it
yeah we gotta i'd say the colour of the border there world you'd find that that's that'd stand out
logo brand
mm 'kay
yellow courgette

well this this what we're gonna t this is their motto like and we're we're not doing well on it
yeah i'll go with five

's bad design that thing

mm yeah
well it depends who your who's what the target people are like you'd say
maybe the fashion conscious
women would be going oh look at that 's cool it looks like a it's
yellow looks like a banana it's cool it's gotta look good in the sitting room
rather than the l c d  whereas uh more technical like like more uh people in with the latest technology it's good it's got an l c d  screen 's only got two buttons and a joystick
so
which which kind of people would be more
likely to buy it

yeah
yeah
yeah
good
very good
we're burs bursting with creativity
and the price was like it was twice the
w assembly cost and would it have to be twice that it could be like coulda had the assembly like maybe fifteen euro
we'll still settle for twenty five
maybe

in the beginning yeah

mm hmm
actually uh you can t perhaps just uh just
th there is one frequency that is the base from for uh
okay
both mm the pitch and uh and the freque
okay s and you can measure measure that or
okay
and i is it uh expensive to do
but in fact if y you speak of uh a lot of things that are not expensive at the end you have uh something that is
hmm
so you have to do f f t  because otherwise
mm hmm
yes
yes but it
i it it is im
it i it yes it is important for detecting patterns because uh
if you say uh let's say uh w how much the person um have spoken
over the the five last minutes uh
uh if someone come and yes
yes yes y
this is uh mm
okay so i uh this is only based on uh you give uh the spectrum and uh uh okay
mm hmm
yes
but uh the last ones are always the
mm not really
mm yes
hmm uh i i said uh we want t to know to um
to do separation just because of the voice recognition i mm this is
not the yes yes
no but but in fact we have uh yes we are designing uh a noise sensitive table just
f from your ring but we are also designing uh a prototype um to analyse the conversations
so uh we might add there a lot of uh features
okay and uh i don't know perhaps uh perhaps if you have two
people speaking uh speaking uh at the same time uh i
don't know if uh voice recognition of an uh such a stream is uh real
okay
yes so that's fine
mm hmm
sure
yes it's not um every important feature for now but
mm hmm
yes
and uh uh another what uh um i don't remember

yes also uh to to extract the context
mm because if you know the words that are spoken you can let's say uh someone say uh he's angry uh about the word he's seen yes
you mi you might want to add uh this kind of this is not in uh my project but
yes um

yes
and have a special events trigger if
sure
sure
no it's it doesn't sound simple but yes you can yes
sure
yes in fact uh for now we are using uh a kind of calibration but uh it's still um
yes
yes um uh but in fact you have to sit in front of the microphone and it's uh yeah people one speak and people two and people three and you are just uh subtracting the the level that you you kept in the other microphones
okay
okay
mm hmm
mm hmm
okay just uh a last question um when you mentioned it um
if i'm speaking very uh how do you say it um
yes i'm just speaking one word every uh every one second yes
a uh is the the event that is detected is um
will be uh a sum of uh small parts there won't be uh
okay so you yes you have to to reprocess to uh to say
let's say yes there is a very small um interval you have to consider it uh
because this is yes this is one this can be considered as one interv intervention
it might be
this is not a very uh easy problem
i'm done
sure yes and you can code java
you can choose matlab
yes sure you have to code it uh directly to the machine
hmm
my sheet is very uh filled up
i will take yours

okay
mm hmm
or actually look at the pitch no don't ask me how it's done i i know the theory so yeah
isn't it the pitch and the frequency the base frequency of the
and if you have both you can um well you can compare this to to one stored and so get out uh which person it is pardon
and uh well the things that make the sou the voice
yeah
and and the the holes in your head everything the the nose and so on and that's that's really uh unique for ev well almost unique for every person so
well once you get this information your frequency and uh your vocal contract or how it's called uh y you can use this information to compare to to to the frames here
no but

no no no no that that that everything is done through through the voice here you take a voice of someone and then you can
get out this information it's it's not p it's clear it's not perfect but s it's enough to to
to use it for for different purposes and uh
um not not that well uh as far as i know actual
is it called p c m  i thi um well it's it's not a technology s yeah it's more or less used this to compress audio i have to i want to check it i can show it you afterwards
well i did a course about it but uh i shouldn't say it too loud
because um the professor is working here at idiap i
should reread what i signed there so
well uh it i'm even not sure if it's that important to know which person is talking because uh
if uh if it i think about a table or so something uh physical uh you just
want to know in in which corner of the table uh speech is coming and not uh which person
produced the speech so
yeah but it's not really related to the ah yeah i see it's uh you need a bit both uh
sound


you might might want to do
you need to separate it


no but i think once you have the voice for a person you can start to do this and uh once uh people have speech recognition or uh far enough to t
mm uh
i think so
the link mm

okay
no i think does this work email
does it work if i put in my email and uh

no if it's not uh i guess you would have to install it and so on
uh no no no you see uh i thought you can put in here your email address and and just uh
do this and then it mails me
yeah you see i want too much
and after all matlab is also programming so it
mm hmm
so
thank you for the information
okay
yes
so you were talking about the two first question okay and a little bit about same people moving with the clustering
uh huh
so this one
what
i'm sorry i didn't really get the point of comparing the pitch the pitch is the is the frequency that is okay and the way you transform it uh v by the mouth you were comparing what with what
uh huh okay okay
so uh
and you were talking about comparing what with what
okay
but you want to have the information because the the mouth you move it
to scan t all the user
okay
okay so you have the p the pitch and you have information about the voice dynamic or
mm mm mm
emotion the involvement in a discussion if you are saying oh yeah yeah we should
okay
in c p u  you mean
not really familiar
hmm okay so you are the expert
careful you are recorded
okay
okay so all this stuff is done from the f f t 
also location to identity uh
mm hmm
okay
mm hmm
but to get a cluster the location that is uh a place where uh noise is regularly coming from
mm hmm
mm mm mm
but for instance for a setting like uh here it would be enough because we are not moving
okay right but we are uh targeting a place where we don't know i where it will be more flexible so we need more than just uh location if we want to uh
mm mm
i agree maybe just
i think it may it may be okay but it depends how long
hmm

from th from the location
oh
mm hmm when are you planning to finish your
okay
more extensible
mm
i don't know how mu maybe we would be more interested to know that it's not the same people more than knowing that it's the same people or to detect that someone is more that was not talking before is talking now
yes
mm
mm

okay
that are further directions
professor was interested to know when people were talking about him ah someone is talking about me let's listen
and lighting a on his office
okay so are you done w with what you wanted to presented us uh in regards with these questions
mm mm three papers about
mm hmm
okay
it's n no problem no more time for problems okay
uh uh
mm mm mm
slowly
might
for the first application we will do with uh prototypes it will be more about quantity uh of
speech or how long how much someone speak but when we will go to final uh
details if i'm talking and someone say yes yes yes from time to time it show that he's participating
and obviously it makes different that if someone is talking and one is replying never uh
nor moving or nor having eyes open
okay
go through them
okay
no i think uh i think we has already have plenty to read
try
and the application you are using all of them uh y every time you are using matlab or you are programming everything is based based on matlab
mm
mm mm mm
okay
i'm writing so only me can read
it's uh a kind of secret language
okay
so b maybe i'll go back to your questions um
yeah
um
yeah
and this also um allows you to separate people
um and the questions i did not talk about was uh going from location to uh identity of the person um
that is quite different you you need to use a signal you have separated and uh
do the type of analysis i mentioned um from the spectrum
you can transform the the magnitude spectrum and um um build
model of the person
um
yeah pitch at least but pitch is
pitch isn't is not enough sometimes
i it's a frequency yeah yeah it's a frequency of your vibration here uh
yeah and then it's transformed through the mouth that's the usual model
yeah
i yeah um it's not necessarily done explicitly but it's equivalent to that yeah so again f f t  is useful to do this type of analysis um
yeah but it's quite personal uh
yeah
yeah
yeah yeah
it it's an information equivalent to that it's maybe n you don't need to do the whole uh complicated modelling but
no no
yeah rate of speech is also possibility um
how fast you speak that's quite personal also but it varies over time
um depending on emotion that also might be interesting for you detecting emotion
yeah yeah
and us yeah yeah so these measures are a way to quantify that
uh p no no no it's not
what w w what is m what is more expensive is to um
take the decision finally so your decision can be for example uh who is it or
if the person moved which is probably the most complicated thing like the person goes
away then comes back ten minutes later sits at a different place uh you will need
to build statistical models of um the person identity using these
measures so the ones um he mentioned um
i don't know if you're familiar with that
yeah
yeah
so um
no
yeah
s
yeah
all i was saying is that these different measures are a way to uh evaluate the identity of the person
so if with location all you can do is extract segments of speech for example
but it will not tell you that these are the same person it's just a location
yeah
yeah
yeah so that might be good for example for ten minutes but then the person might move or a different person might come
yeah
it is well unless sometimes somebody goes there or yeah
yeah
mm hmm
yeah
yeah
yeah
so it hmm
but that you can do with location if it's only on the short term
on on the off line yeah i would say you might use these measures in a simple
way if you do it uh on line like um to give feedback
but uh you you mentioned that another side of your project is also to analyse off line so there
you might want to use a
we had a student here he finished uh one or two years ago but he left his software
and his software is precisely to do that to um cluster
at uh another level to cluster these small clusters of speech uh
group them by person automatically y no from the
these measures pitch etcetera
so um
yeah exactly so i would say from location at the lower level you can get
small parts of speech and then at the next level possibly off line you can uh
group them into um a speech segment i'm hoping
to have enough time to try um doing that before
i finish my thesis um so if i manage to do some um
uh practically usable software i'll tell you
uh in five six months abou approximately

more busy i would say
yeah
so you said you want to do separation um but ex exactly yeah
yeah
okay
okay
ah you want to do voice recognition
you might want okay

okay
yeah
so yeah once you have locations it's not a big problem um
mm hmm
no no you should separate them first yeah yeah
so
so the type of things i presented can lead to separation
um it's only a very small step to add
yeah yeah
although it might be if you want to um ex extract these features like pitch and uh
rate of speech or energy simply from each person um you
might have to do some ba basic separation 'cause quite often people uh don't realise that they
talk at the same time um interrupt each other so
even if you don't want to recognise a speech fully at least um you need yeah
it's okay you can email later yeah um
so
yeah
uh
okay a semantic context yeah yeah yeah then mm
hmm

so it's uh
yeah you could detect one word yeah keyword spotting yeah

so um
yeah yeah i i'll just say uh if you want i can point to
um three papers um but
no i think it's better if i just send you the link it's probably simpler
uh one im is about this um sector based stuff like uh the localisation and detection
one is about how to take the decision that somebody's active or not um it sounds simple at first you think you just put the threshold and that's it but um the problem is uh the
it no you can do that there's no problem but i if you want your your system to work
in different conditions like cafeteria library um the environment will be quite different
so a single fixed threshold value might be a problem s
yeah
so you can do that automatically this kind of things um i don't know if you're doing that already but uh
okay
so uh i have another paper which might be interesting for that for a single channel uh calibration and i've code on line so for this particular one
and the last one i would say is um the clustering um
to um yeah the clustering of the different locations over time so that
you can get small clusters of speech um
there are other ways to do it but uh i think it's it's important because um in
spontaneous speech all these words are quite small so you need to do that uh
adequately yeah but otherwise yeah i'm done
hmm
yeah yeah many small events basically yeah
yeah basically uh i mean it depends uh
yeah even if somebody says just yes
i don't know if it's important for you or not it might be
yeah
yeah
hmm
yeah
y yeah
yes um
so i i'll send you links some of the papers are long but you can just um briefly look yeah
um we can go and see olivier unless you want to talk about something else
huh
well we can try but uh
we have yeah we have o c r  but maybe not on this computer yeah
that is good idea yeah it's a good idea
yeah yeah
yeah once i i um coded the most expensive part in c  just to see so you can have a mix of both from matlab you call c  and back
but the day you want to do uh on line real time stuff nah i wouldn't wouldn't trust it
wait for the marketing director actually so
anyways
uh
see shall we wait i'm not sure if he's late or delayed or whatever so i'm gonna start soon we have now don't have much time anyway there you are okay
uh no problem we're about to start so have a seat
okay welcome again today functional design phase
i'll take you over the minutes of last last meeting okay that was just to get to know each other have a little thoughts on what your vision is and on this project so
i put the minutes on the i made on the on the p the the project share so if you wanna review them they're there
i will do so after every meeting so if you have some information you wanna take back you can find it there anyways
um today three presentations from every one of you
um after that i got some new project requirements from project board so we're gonna go af go after over this later
but i wanna start with uh stuff you did first so we can see what everybody came up with
and after that we can have the new requirements and share some thoughts so who would like wanna go first
take it
anyway let's see what you have
uh it's still a bit open
you should close it on your own notebook i guess yeah so there okay
if i can cut in is it people or men is it people okay 'cause i thought it was only men so 'kay
so we have to s we have to do something about that
okay
okay just talk ahead
mm hmm
mm hmm
okay that's okay
that's a little weird
okay we can we can hide those under a menu or something okay
that's like a button on your t v 
remote okay
okay
we wanna have a little preview on the remote control preview what's on the channel okay
that sounds too it's possible but uh i think it's expensive but do continue
okay you don't set it yourself it just remembers the channel that you are on most for example you
want the you want it to be programmed for example y programmed f or you want it to recognise your favourite channel
let's see you you spend twenty minutes each day on that channel so it recognises your favourite channel
okay so it's it it does it recognise itself you don't have to set it okay
okay
i see
okay
no problem it's it's okay that's yeah go ahead
that seems very good
mm hmm
okay so have it more make it more durable actually okay
okay so the buttons should be
mm hmm yeah
wow the s yeah make it make them bigger even more durable uh
okay
yeah it's true
yeah that's clear
no of course uh
yeah
i must say that it
hmm
that was it okay that was good so we agree on the the part that we need to
get something on the on the remote to find it somewhere and increase it the durability of of
the thing so the other aspects we'll just see how what you came up with and what's possible for that budget
okay

mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah of course hmm
you mean integrate them all into the circuit board okay
yeah okay so you have
mm hmm
okay
okay that was it i'll get back to my thing then
uh
okay back this up to the screen so i got some new information on the project specifications are
changing a little like you said uh teletext is not not very popular anymore because the uh
the internet nowadays people don't use the teletext anymore or hardly so it can either
well i don't think we should remove the button because there are always people who are using it but i don't think it should be very
it should be one of the big buttons for example just put it somewhere or under second option or whatever it's not important
anymore um we're targeting young people now because our um
this is a new product and with this new product we want to appeal to younger people which are um the younger people were defined under forty i so i think it's that's also good with the fashion and everything so yeah
they want to pay for it people are willing to spend money actually to buy a um remote that they like if they like the way it looks the way it functions so they're actually gonna spend uh spend money on it
yeah see how far we can go with it anyway so and one thing that should be important is that the corporate l colour and slogan are recognisable which is apparently black and yellow but
i'm not sure if we i think we should keep the the logo in mind because with colours you can uh have a lot of uh fashionable colours and everything on it which suits everybody's taste so
with that concept i started thinking so why not just steal nokia's idea and just make changeable covers for your i mean those cost hardly anything i think and people could even spend extra money
on buying a cover and so have an entire new remote control that they like to see or we can sh for example we can make a different a basic design
and sell the covers separately for example that's just a little marketing idea that could be applied so you can p it appeals to really
everyone so you don't have to i think you don't have to make entire remote controls we make a basic one and
manufacture this cover separately so that was that was my idea on what we could do to appeal
this product to everyone so just
i'm not sure if you came up with anything in the meantime after making a presentation would you like to share
okay
oh yeah i think we should lose the l c d  screen like you said i think for example it's it's huge i think the l c d  is huge it consumes batteries like hell
i think it takes up a lot of a lot of power it costs a lot i think what we could do what could be possible is maybe not an l c d  screen but with a preview but y i'm not sure if it's even possible for example a little t v  guide
like you have a little just just a text only not colour just a little text thing so you can use your remote as a t v  guide i'm not sure
it's even possible but maybe okay make it yeah find a little compromise in that but what did
i write down i think the p yeah the beep is a very simple thing to imple implement just make a button on your t v  and just hit the button it
beeps somewhere i think it's easy to implement we should go for that uh speech recognition
i thin yeah i mean where else should you put it
yeah but how are you gonna use that if your i mean if your remote control is lost how are you gonna press where are you gonna press the button
a slap on sticker oh you mean as like a separate thing you can attach to your t v  yeah that could be possible a little little box you can attach to your t v  is fine then okay
i think it's universal
i think we should go for universal because apparently we're a separate company making separate c remote controls to sell to a lot of diverse people i think universal remote control should be possible
yeah i think we're targeting everyone so remote
okay universal is good speech recognition i think it's very hard because we're selling across multiple countries so i think implementing speech recognition is such a small um apparatus it's very hard to do
yeah but i don't see arabian people speaking one two uh whatever
it's yeah it's not a mature technology i think it takes a lot of memory and everything in in a remote control so
i don't think it should be implemented in a remote control yet uh what else do we have um well you should you should look into the in into the materials that are real durable
so the the the symbols won't fade maybe a little harder plastic or especially li we don't maybe we don't have have to do all the buttons but especially the ones that are um the popular buttons so those always fade first
mm the thing is the most important things that we have now let's see
for example
well we're not we're not targeting older people we should remember that everything we target is under forty so you assume that that they read correctly and i think they're the most important thing about young people is that they're really sensitive to to trends that are passing through the world so
no of course no i think it's just something you you put over them because yeah we c yeah you ca well tha that's not a that's not a bad that's not even it's not even a bad idea i mean for example if you're if you're into the durability issue
you could for example if your buttons are faded after i mean if you make a durable remote they are faded you can just buy a new cover uh i'm not sure it's it's hard to make so it's a good and a bad idea
mm hmm
yeah i know it's just just a one one piece of rubber for example okay yeah that's what i something i have to look into either either change both the buttons and and the cover or just the cover i'm not sure which which is easier so
um anyway yeah this is what we're gonna do afterwards just lunch break and have more individual work after that so let's see what we let's see we
so you have to come up with a components concept yeah i want some you should do some trend watching because
even if we're if we're gonna do those covers and everything what people really want that's what we need to know in this phase because
that's gonna be the essential final design that we're gonna come up with
um
yeah i think user interface is fairly obvious i mean it should be very intuitive s yeah
it should speak for itself uh for example i bought a remote control last week with a new t v  it was it l it's like all buttons and you have no
idea what it does at first and i'm total t v  new anyway
so i think it should be have less or l very little buttons and maybe a second
second level menu for the advanced things or maybe just stick 'em under a menu like you said the um the sound
options and the surround and whatever they're more complicated just stick 'em under one menu and uh give it a just put it
in in s in a software piece you can menu and you can uh select everything you want to to set on your t v 

that is true
no that's true
yeah that's true
i'm not sure if it's impossible but uh there's a chance it's not so
a double sided remote control i don't think that's useful
yeah but then you're gonna have a lot of wasted buttons for example you have a sony t v  and the half of the buttons won't function if you have a for a sony that won't for a philips t v 
i don't think we should yeah for exam
i'm not s yeah for ex you have to make it a little decision between the part if you want a universal remote control that it
should do what people usually do with their t v s not not the very complicated settings that you
can usually do that with uh either a old old remote control if they really hate that thing but
you can't you cannot take into consideration all the different brands of t v s i think there's i think there is a standard
for example between uh because usually the the menu is
the menu button is is usable between different brands
especially the big ones the big brands so 'cause everybody i have a universal remote control and it can use
the menu button so i think i'm not sure if you can put some research into that if it's possible uh i think just a b and
the navigation is very basic it's usually the same thing
yeah
yeah that's true i think so uh we need to put some research into that if if we can open the menu i think it's possible
just the way how to yeah then then you could do everything i suppose because usually
the t v s have tha that inside in this other little piece of software so it's okay
mm hmm
yeah
yeah i think it should be a little distinct from everything else because it's either it's both mayb maybe the shape can be a little different maybe it's a little more curves or whatever
so um
yeah this not sure what because we have forty minutes i'm not sure how much time we have left for the meeting anyway so
yeah but it wasn't me it was him closing something so anyway yeah we could do some i do some work now on on the design for example i mean what do you want do you want but
yeah may maybe something like this
but though smooth inside
so you have the transmitter here for example let's see that you what would be handy i think that the the buttons should be the channel buttons should be uh on their own let's see one two god damn it
yeah okay
another one here let's see what i think this should these are always on top of the of the control so they should be here
think it's like this
withi within the yeah just take it
do you take triangles or
um i think it should be i think it maybe we should make 'em bigger or whatever yeah
yeah in the middle it's it's usually uh there but
mm
yeah but for example if it's lost in your armchair we'll not see the flash
and flash takes up a lot of batteries again
yeah
yeah i thought about for deaf people for example so we could do that uh let's see
oh yeah it's true
um that thing should be central you shouldn't be you uh shouldn't press it by accident but it shouldn't be stacked away somewhere
yeah
yeah like that's gonna work
yeah i thought maybe we should move the buttons down and put it here for example to
from top to bottom yeah that's true you should i think the bu the power button should be on top 'cause it's the first thing you do turn it on so power button on top um
mute do we hardly i think it should be at the bottom somewhere
mute turn the sound off
i don't think it's important but i think it i think it should be you c you could put it somewhere here
no because it yeah people are accustomed to that it's

can i have that that's j
take this out and here see
uh are we gonna take triangles anyway i'm drawing triangles but
yeah it's maybe a bigger lesser than thing so anyway i think this is should be
the channels and or sh
here okay okay should we chan okay this two channel
up and down
well for that is it's on one part it's um it's a good thing to recharge it
maybe we should what what could be possible is one with rechargeable batteries for example you have just put penlite batteries that are rechargeable because it's an it's it's it's very annoying
i'm not sure y i'm not sure it's if it's expensive but just take a look at it because it might be a very good idea
because if it's it's uh useful to have it rechargeable but at the same time if you don't
want recha if you forgot to recharge it and you wanna watch t v  now you wanna be able to put different batteries
in it use it now and not in half an hour
how about
i think i have a nice idea
not exactly uh
i think it's uh it's a pretty good idea to have uh like sort of a maybe a base station that you put on the t v  could be flat you could insert your uh remote into it
i'm not sure a what
well we were talking about the fact that we wanted to insert either a beep or a flash into the thing with a little separate signal
or so you could put that on a t v  for example it could be very flat could be very small
it's a very small yeah i'm drawing it big now but so you can put your remote on flat for example
and at the backside of remote just just just a little hole
for example um you just put it down it recharges for example i don't think it's very expensive
i'm not sure if it costs a lot that that's what he r
that's that you that's what you buy yourself
it's just an idea we have to find out if it's possible
do they want but they want a rechargeable one
i'm not sure you should find out if it's if rechargeable is important
yeah
they want to pay for comfort we just assu we we could either make a separate station which just sends a signal to the remote control to either beep or flash to find it um and
yeah we have to either that or make it integrated with a with a docking station
i think it would be good actually i like the beep part anyway so um let's go through the
covers is covers is good yeah it's oh we can save this up and saved we even saved the ant
um
okay
so what we have is you have i think you have to do a lot of work on if it's possible for the cost
maybe yeah or maybe you can find out i what people are willing to pay we are going for twenty five euros sales price
but just try to find out what they're willing to pay for it because if they're willing to pay more we could lose a little profit and maybe
attract more customers uh we just have to see what it looks like
yeah if you have some financial information that that'd be nice so hmm
no it wasn't wasn't allo it was possible not allowed so
so that's um why i'm not sure that you're allowed to share documents on the on the draft
i don't care i haven't heard any complaints yet so um
yeah the oh they inc uh they include the new one or just for you
oh no i didn't have that
all it tells just let's make make a new tick the new one
um other side yeah let's increase it a little because
yeah draw us up some some designs of of possible just keep in mind that the important buttons should be on top and either big so the more less important
more or less
just play a little with this put l shift a little up or down and we'll see what looks best
or just po post your designs from time to time on the product share
yeah so we don't want we want very little buttons just the buttons you use a lot
well what we had function that what people do so people change channels people
they change the volume and they they change channel they turn t v  off and on for example that's the basic fu that's what you do i'm not sure who
present that again but those are the basic function that people use it for so those should be very well represented
that's true but that's what we stick under the menu button everything is you say in every t v  that's configured under the menu
yeah but
but i think most modern t v s have it in their menu
uh we'll we'll see what we can come up with
under forty yeah
mm hmm
yeah yeah
the want to pay for oh
uh shall we
younger age sixteen and forty five
that's all here here it says
yeah age sixteen forty fi interest in main features more critical okay so we're not focusing on this
um
all the interest in features not really the l c  oh here would you pay for uh speech recognition in a remote control hmm okay
speech recognition is quite
yeah just look at the possibilities then because if apparently it's what people want it's supposed to be a luxurious remote maybe it's not even that expensive or find a compromise maybe just a black and white or for some extra information on it on your programmes
me too i mean we all do right i think it's something we should put into consideration apparently it's what people want so we should see if what it costs if it's possible
yeah
yeah we should do a little thing about design because it looks boring really to me even if you put it even if you put a different cover on it it looks still looks boring so
i have no clue i just drew something what which would fit into your hand easily
i think it's a very
sorry
yeah
okay mm hmm yeah but you have to j just keep in mind it shouldn't be too heavy i mean we can stick it in in there i think huh even if in the worst case we can even could you give me the pen back
so let's say that people would want an l c d  thing let's take take the basic design again what we oh crap uh came up with i'll just make it a little bigger now
so a transmitter here anyway
we could let's say we have an l c d  screen people want an l c d  screen so then we should probably put it here
it doesn't have to be really big but just just have to be has to be there think it's a good place people don't
no it's not that uh it's not the most important function it's just an extra thing it just you press the buttons on top because your finger is on top
how can you use an l c d  screen
yeah but why i i'm not sure
uh if you t if you press a button you can see it ri i'm not sure wha i'm trying to imagine myself what it would look like
you would prefer it n okay so we have three people saying it should be on top
okay but then you would would s have to stack away your buttons somewhere else anyways
uh this looks a little
about the l c d s thing well if it if it's if it's possible wi if it's not too expensive we should include it because it's it's cool
uh we have green now uh
or maybe we should m we could uh draw draw something a bit that has it on on on the bottom maybe in a circle for example like we like in this example i think this is not good but for we could make circular buttons for example
for up and down ma make it a circle on it because it
i think the channel button should be in the centre channel button should be st stick together for example here in this section because it's uh
we're not sure about the size anyway just a general design you can make it as big as you want for example if you take uh
no let's see for example just
yeah i don't think if we if we even use an l c d  screen we need to definitely
yeah but we have to see what the si what the size is the l c d  doesn't have to nee doesn't need to be very big
mm let's see
finish meeting now okay we will so either
we either we have to decide what what people want either this one this this could be the luxurious one
so we have channel buttons here i'm just drawing something uh uh
i think this would this would look cool you could have it for example
small buttons here for some extra functions so if your basic function's here we should like we decided before programmes up and down
and volume here
well you can just no i'm not sure if we can do that but we could put a microphone in here for example
just to do research into both w what it costs and what it takes for space but let's cut the meeting for now yes
yeah let's think of a name okay
uh okay
okay at anyways the the minutes will be on the on the web shortly so there we go uh

yeah to all


oh there he is
go ahead
that's pretty shocking uh

which channel selection
oh okay

is that manageable 'cause it sounds pretty expensive too
okay

okay
shall i go okay
so some technical functions
basically i have some issues which you discussed earlier uh let's just start with the method it sounds really easy what does the user do what does the th remote control do but there are quite some issues
so the things i'm going to concentrate on are the user aspect because the technical aspect that's pretty much covered we can do that what goes wrong
at the user gets the remote control where is the remote control we've all had it once i want
to watch some television where's the remote control that was one of your ideas which you posted in the network folder a really good
idea uh these are just the issues i come to some uh personal experience findings
possible solutions later searches for the button
there are many buttons on a remote control which are not clear uh so either we lose those or we try to make it a little bit more clear uh also symbols tend to fade after a while
there's nothing more annoying than faded symbols because you don't know which channel is this button
so possibly we could find uh something for that yes uh
covered that oh yes user presses the button um usually when you have a lot of buttons buttons are
small so you press more once remote control goes
kablouey or something like that so we have to pay attention not to put too mun too many buttons on uh the remote control and possibly also the size so more important buttons bigger si
so this is basically what i h had in mind in the fade proof symbols locator a sound
uh so clear we should stick to existing symbols but maybe we could do a little uh
investigation to see whether some symbols are uh need to be replaced by others uh
this i pretty much covered so what we want to go to is not this one but more less buttons easy some bigger buttons
so that's basically uh what i had in mind
this is not the final design this is just a general idea of how i'd like to see uh basically the general idea
so that was it
yeah i think it's a really good idea
yeah
yeah
okay
yeah
oh
is it manageable is it easy
yeah
and it costs too much to fabricate so we're on a tight budget here
and it's
maybe just a slap on sticker with a button which sends out a small signal
yeah exactly
and it's
besides that the technology isn't really super yet so that is a problem in implementing this
it's a good idea but it's just not i don't think the market's ripe for that yet
but should the exchangeable covers include the buttons themselves or just the
c that's a problem with the with the text then

oh yeah i know what you mean
yeah
pretty straightforward
is it techni technically possible to uh send a signal to a television and then pops up a menu because we're working with different types of television so we're going to work with that
it's an in built menu isn't it yes
so basically we
or we could use a double sided for less used functions you
yeah with the cover i it's basically an idea to overcome these issues because
no but basic functions but functions which are not frequently used because if we use a universal remote control we're going to have to have most buttons on it so
yeah
yeah i have some ideas
i have some ideas
i'll put some on paper and present them next time uh the ideas that i have
i heard a beep go
yeah but we like some some curves or
yeah
oh we get the general ideas yes
yeah and since you're holding it like this i suggest you put the channel up channel down and volume yeah yeah
so you have the up channel
the down channel the volume do we want that horizontal or vertical
this is basically what people are accustomed to so
yeah but this is just a g general idea uh maybe the menu button can go i in the middle
whoa
you won't be able to find it
we could make a combination that it goes beep and that you that some light lights up
so we have the basic channels we've got here uh the power button
somewhere over here
i usually
press it on top at least that's what i'm accustomed to
what would you like to
okay mute button is that somewhere here is that used often
the mute button do people use that often 'cause uh i'm pretty much accustomed to it right over here
at least in general but
it's not that important no
sure
that's pretty much what people are accustomed to aren't they
well i'm accustomed to the channels being on top
but isn't that expensive in the entire package

but again isn't that too expensive 'cause that means that we have to implement rechargeable batteries a docking station
and do people actually want that to pay extra they want to pay for rechargeable
can can we save this or

yeah
could you post some other essentials of what people want so that i can work with some buttons where to put it
you seem to have information on that i'd like to uh
see some of it
no it's not no
oh your computer okay
well i have your powerpoint presentation i can get some inf information out of that
let's see
oh where would we
where would we want the uh teletext button because we decided that it's n not that important do we put it somewhere over here
or maybe this is something for the next meeting i can draw out some ideas
yeah
well we have decided more or less the basic structure i can put the other buttons in
yeah
yeah
maybe another idea uh
yes but it should cover all the functions so possibly just an idea that popped in
yeah but we could go a step further because some t v s have the uh possibility to adjust brightness that kind of menus
yes but it
because we're making
we need to adjust to the technology
true
no i thi
oh we're not going to be able to sell it for twenty five then with an l c d  screen

well i doubt it but
well i had basically
something like this to make it kind of futuristic
so what kind of
yeah sure
now it's pretty much tucked away in your hand
i'm
i'm still not convinced of the
yeah
so basically can i what we have to decide now is uh what goes on top do we put the volume control and the channel control here or do we put it on he would we like to press it in the middle
yes but we do agree that we keep this at the centre because it's basically the most important function
well that would make them quite small so maybe you'd put them here
yes but a big remote control probably not something which people would like
so would we like this or would we like the
let's see what we have here
okay
so i think of a name
so
yes go and finish up and i'll see you at lunch
yeah
okay we
mm
okay that's fine um okay now work a little with me
okay well let's start it as it is okay uh the method there are a few questions
that need to be answered uh you already uh talked about it a little bit which buttons are wanted uh is our
remote control universal or should it be programmable uh if it should be programmeab grammeale then we need um
something like a mode that you can switch it because then the buttons have to send out a different signal then they would normally do
and uh how big is the remote control uh going to be i'll tell you why that's important to me
um there are a lot of technical parts in the remote control so uh uh that's why i also would
like to say uh go a little bit easy on the designs uh i heard ab uh you talking about beeps
and about uh video screens but uh the material inside and the technical aspects are quite complex already
so keep in mind that everything that you keep uh think of it has to b to be built so it's that's not as easy as it
s might look like uh material study i'm working on that um for the the costs i have to check out
how far i can go with that normally a circuit board is made of fibreglass uh and the wires are made of copper
uh that is how it is done and all the remote controls work that way i think we can just go on with that um
then i've read more integration of materials means less cost for the production the more we can make uh
at once uh in one piece uh that is cheaper
exactly so if we make a circuit board with the the connections already on it then that's cheaper so
we have to make something that's not too difficult in design again this is what look like uh looks like
if you press one button so this is not the entire thing you have the the power coming in then you have like a switch
the switch uh uh uh if you p press it then some electrical charge goes into the processor
that thinks over a morse code that's how you should see it the morse code goes to the amplifier then uh the signal is sent
to two uh light bulbs you have infrared and an interv um uh how to say it uh
a light in indication light that you know that it's functioning
uh here again that's my story about the different modes if you do want to make remote uh universal then
the processor has to uh make up a different morse code when some button is pressed that makes it
much more complex so we really need to have a look do we want that or not uh i don't have any
personal p uh preferences uh so far except for uh the materials to be used uh light that they are light
that was it
hmm
yeah
mm hmm
hmm
no i think this is a good idea but
go ahead
y
yes i think so too
yeah
okay uh
mm
hmm
mm hmm
hmm i have to check that out i'm not sure
that must be possible
ja
i'm sorry whe where do you wanna hit the t  you wanna we want a button on the television in th okay but that rules out a universal remote control
because that's not possible uh
uh
yeah
exactly
okay then uh i'd i'd like to know now if we want the uh universal remote control or not because that's uh determines everything i'm gonna do if not okay
okay then i go for that
yeah
okay no it's fine with me but then i know what to look for
uh huh
mm hmm
exactly i already noted that
mm okay
okay
hmm
if we uh make a remote control with changeable covers then we can also make uh a cover for every language area that's fo is uh especially for older people that they can read it read it in their own language
that's okay okay
huh
uh okay
hmm
hmm
mm
okay
uh but i know that the buttons are like a nokia telephone on uh one sleeve so you don't have
to change your whole cover uh we can make something that you can only remove the sleeve know what i mean it works
the same as a nokia telephone it's it's in my uh 'kay
exactly
hmm


mm
yeah
i don't think so
no i don't think so because the television needs to respond to the signal and if it doesn't know how it's exactly that's not possible
hmm
mm
mm
but that might be broken

hmm
hmm
hmm
hmm
mm okay
mm but i think there must be a way uh to invoke the more complicated functions of a television
for instance if your old remote control is broken and you buy ours then uh you should be able to get everything
out of the television that's in it because otherwise you'll lose functions by buying our
okay i thi i think so too
and i think that our r remote control should not look like uh any other for instance uh sony makes all their remote controls exactly the same for all their devices and you always grab the wrong one because formatting of the buttons is exactly the same only the labels are different we should not do that
exactly
mm that's your uh division
hmm
yeah
perhaps we should also make uh something like a flash on it if you if it's lost for people that are deaf they they won't hear the the beep
yeah
uh
yeah it's true but it's it's only has to do so when you press the button that it's lost
so
deaf people
i have another idea i'm not sure if it's possible
mm
yeah me too
shall we uh also look if it's possible to make a rechargeable remote that you don't have to buy new batteries if every
mm yeah
uh
but that's already possible
yes
yes
okay uh you could make a device but i'm not sure how that uh is possible with the costs that you can put in normal batteries rechargeable but it you're the remote also can act as a recharger so then you can choose you have every decision know what i mean
you can uh put in normal penlites rechargeable penlites but they can also be recharged with the remote with a wire
so but
but i think that will cost a lot uh a normal wire would be better like a like a p d a  a hand held you can uh just put it in the electricity and it charges itself you don't need basic station
yes
that is possible that's true
mm
yeah
yeah

mm
yes i'm going to try to find that out i'm not sure if there's information available on this but
hmm these are uh comfort issues so i think people will pay they wanted to pay for comfort well this is comfort
yes
hmm
yeah exactly i think this is a brilliant product i would buy it myself
uh
i like the covers that's a brilliant idea i never thought
i hope if i have information about that i'm gonna

mm yeah
i would like to make a decision what it costs and what kind of materials that we can uh choose what we want in it and exactly i need it
was it not possible to uh send emails around the office
not
yeah okay
what uh what did you wanna say
mm mm
mm
but that's the question is it because it needs to be configured in the television under the menu if it isn't then we cannot reach it
i think so too i think so too uh isn't there a possibility to do research on that so we know that for sure
if you rule out functions then uh and that gets known then people are not gonna buy it then the consumer bond or something says uh you cannot do this and that with it that's a bad bad com commercial for okay
that's true
hmm
hmm
did they really said it like that those two things do they realise how much that costs that's almost undoable
no that's that's even if i if we have this lost unit then we cannot do it for that price
yeah that's true
mm
hmm
uh
uh i
but i really need finance information
we all do
mm
uh
hmm and the design it should differ this is philips huh philips has this
okay
hmm
uh
mm oh i realise if we make it small then it needs to be a little thicker because i need to put all the electronics in it if we make it s uh smaller uh less wide then we need to m make it a little thicker because i have to put all the electronics in it
no
hmm
me too
ah but
hmm
no m i personally would prefer it on the top
huh
but it
hmm
mm
hmm
they want it uh
we should just try to make that if it's possible if it is possible we should really do it but we need that information
also keep in mind again the l c d  screen is very flat but it needs transistors resistors i don't know what more and that needs space
so i have to look if that's possible
but if we
hmm
hmm
if we have a a space issue we can also lose one battery it is rechargeable so we can stick with one instead of two that might be an option
yeah but if we need two batteries and an l c d  screen that means a lot of space that we need but it has to be a little bit heavier
okay
no but the things behind it space
like a process uh
i like this one more
mm
mm
i'll try to
one more uh thing i'd like to say uh let's give this uh a name and not like some vague serial number that no one understands like with cars shall we all try uh to think about a name
good luck
yeah i've do we uh save the
yes sorry a little bit of pl little problem with computer

uh
yeah sure no problem um there was a little problem with my computer so not uh the whole uh presentation uh
yeah
um
okay and
i want to open the my s oh no
oh no that's okay
uh slide show
yes the functional requirements it's uh uh very important
for uh the user he he wants to yeah the the method we used uh it it's
not m not a slide because it went wrong but the method we use uh um we tested
it w uh with uh a hundred uh men and we asked them to
w uh what the remote uh f feel uh like and uh what what's uh important
uh
people sorry both women and men yeah okay uh the findings um uh seventy five percent of the users find most remote controls ugly um
yeah and yeah most th th they want to spend money for a better system for better
remote control so we can do uh a l a little uh nice things with it and
um they use yeah they use zap a lot um uh fifty percent say they only
so that's the most important things um oh yeah not all of it is it on mine
on my powerpoint presentation but um uh the relevant buttons are the power
the channel selection and the volume selection it's uh the most basic buttons that a user wants uh
to use uh less important is tel teletext
uh um they use it but it's not uh very uh important uh on
the scale of zero to ten they six and a half uh and but
not important is the channel selection the the hmm oh the
the no no no no no that's very important but uh w and not important in the
audio settings display settings and uh
yeah
um new preferences preferences uh um um beep
to find your control was that was in the test the the most people uh f
find it uh irritating uh when they cannot find a rem their remote control so uh i think
it's a bee beep to sound it and uh you can find it and another
thing uh they want was uh speech recognition um so they
can say uh what they want to let's go to channel one and uh that's uh kind
of things and they want maybe an uh l c d  screen um to to look
it um wh what's on every channel uh and uh what do i want with it
yeah
yeah
yeah um
uh my personal preferences is uh a button for my favourite channel so i can uh i dunno so i can zap to my uh
f uh quick uh to my favourite channel wh what i uh so the remote mu must see or um
must um see wha what mine preferences are for which channel so i can zap t to
what
yeah
yeah
recognise
yeah
yeah that's uh what my personal preference like
no itself maybe it's easier to to sell it but
i don't know it's manageable but we will uh we will see yeah it's a little bit uh it's the end of it it's a little bit uh i lost it the computer uh crashed so
yeah
darn computer
yeah
yeah
yeah
mm uh
yeah
uh
yeah
b
yeah and they want to pay for it and uh
with more
where with more technical specifications
in the
yeah
yeah
but oh
yeah with with an l c d  screen you can
why nokia w
uh
okay
yeah
yeah
mm uh
yeah
um
everyone uh wants to buy it so we w yeah
yeah
or one
or when you say one two uh i it uh it's enough right but
oh yeah
yeah
okay
yeah
yeah
but b
but every
oh
yeah
yeah
yeah
okay
yeah
mm yeah
yeah yeah
yeah yeah
yeah
um yeah
and uh with different colours uh
okay
yeah
uh
and a light uh
volume
uh it's it's fine i think
oh d

yeah
just
and l e d  uh on it
just a light on it or
very important
oh that's
it's
and
but you r
and you are reading from the t you always read from the top to the the bottom of it yeah so it's
yeah
so i it's sorry
no it's no

uh
hmm
or or with the volume selection
around uh not uh not at top at the around the volume selection i don't know where exactly but

wha
no yeah
yeah that's better on the right
yeah
maybe it's more ex expensive
yeah
hmm
yeah yeah
yeah that's g
but
which
yeah
yeah
but
yeah they want to pay for it
yeah
th uh there was not a el ask esque
but
but f hmm




yeah
yeah okay
yeah yeah yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
my computer crashed so uh
i lost my uh presentation but
i have the uh
yeah but i
here i have the the s the homepage of uh our
internet and here is my
here is my marketing report maybe you ca you can look at uh that and
ah yeah and one
and uh wha what people want
i've uh
i have another thing uh
yeah um
uh what i al already said is the the uh the remote controls are always lost but it it's also for people they want to learn it fast not uh they want to
no
it's yeah it's easy to learn wi and uh
um
and
the
if
um

if um
another thing i want to say is that uh we are looking at the market for the age uh
younger than forty um on my report i didn't uh ish
i didn't show it in my uh presentation because my computer crashed um they want to pay for an l c d 
screen and speech recognition
so
i yeah yeah and
yeah
uh but
if if they
so uh
we can
we can look at the possibilities for an uh l c d  and uh i dunno yeah
how much it will cost and
um
it will come uh
yeah

different colours maybe
but all
okay

if you're reading from top to bottom i think it's better to put it uh at the top it's j
uh but i if you if you are going to uh put the l c d  on it i think it's very important to use it uh because it's use it uh
but nee the function of it so you can use it maximum because uh it's a lot it costs a lot
so
yeah
it's expensive to build it so
you must use the maximum of it
huh
uh but uh
yeah i know uh
in middle of it
in the middle

yeah
it's the most import yeah
finish meeting now it's on your computer
uh
or
and uh what about speech recognition uh
yeah yeah but or or an l c d  or an uh speech i think it's l c d  is better now
yeah
yeah
yeah okay yeah that's yeah that's okay
oh good
yeah
same
right
okay
right s so i haven't made a powerpoint presentation yeah i i
thought i'll use the whiteboard instead um mm
okay so basically i'll start off by uh i
thought i'll use the whiteboard because we have so many different options and what we can do is that we can start um
uh rubbing off the options that we do not require and putting in the options that uh are
m or highlighting or underlining them or something like that
okay so uh i'll start again with a brief introduction to connect that anyway
brief introduction to the insides of a remote control and uh
then we can probably uh discuss the various components yeah
okay so w what you see here is so this is the outside of the remote right
if you open it you have a circuit board here right and this is the chip
that i was talking about last time this basically sends information to a tr uh transistor here which
then uh sends the information to an l e d  device here if you flip the printed
circuit board and this is th the most important point here uh everything else is kind of
okay so if you flip the circuit board this is what it looks like so you see for example a particular
button attaches to a particular place on the p c b  and uh
on pressing this button i a circuit completes the information goes to the chip which is somewhere here
and the chip that tra then translates the code into an infra infrared radiation which goes goes out
through there so uh the important point that i read over the website was
uh that the configurations of these printed circuit circuit boards uh are
quite cheap to make you can ge get them printed as you want to so w we can have a configuration um
irrespective of the cost the way we want to have right so that's the important point here so these are the different
options that we have
okay so the batteries i'll start with the battery right
so they can be simple which is like uh the normal batteries
in uh our uh the cells yeah uh thes these are the
kind different kind of batteries that the company makes right so
and dynamos
um yeah yeah so uh
i don't know if even if you want to consider this but these are the different things that the company makes so th they'll they'll since
uh they'll come internally from the company they'll be eas uh cheaper uh all these options so
the third one is uh the kinetic energy ones
yeah

yeah it's a good option the the kinetic energy one is uh that e uh uh
they are usually modern watches since our hand keeps moving it keeps the watch ticking but i dunno i if it is
a good idea for a remote control because it'll just lie there for a long while sometimes but as soon as you pick it up it moves and then again
it uh re recharges or something and the fourth option is the solar cells
which are also made by the company environment friendly okay um
so i'll list things and then we can come back and discuss what what we think from uh everybody's perspective
there are different cases that can be provided they can be basically the shape
of the cases they can be flat they can be curved with uh
one sided
curved and one side flat and they can be curved with on both the sides
these are the three options right um
yeah would it be flat on both the sides would be curved from one side or whatever
uh there were different kind of supplements available um like it can be in plastic rubber wood or
titanium right wo wo wood
yeah not wool
oh really okay um the so uh we can use
even um a certain titanium is also used uh in the company to make uh uh some space
design equipment so it's kind of um uh it'll be probably nicer to use because it relates to
the overall image of the company but uh it cannot be used on a double curved surface if we choose
this we cannot use titanium for for these two we can use titanium wood rubber
or plastic yeah uh okay the interface options now
so
we can have push buttons like most remotes do and our company is an expert in making push buttons
ooh uh we can have scroll wheels like the ones on um uh mouse pointers uh uh
yeah yeah something like that so and they have they can even have an an integrated uh push button
inside the scrolling thing the scroll plus push so this is something that
has been recently developed by the company um in the last decade so not too recent
and l c d s we can have l c d s so these two are recent and and this is q
quite old the various electronic options are um
uh so th this concerns firs first of all the the chips i i showed you at uh so there's
there's a chip behind this one right the p c b  is uh inexpensive so we can put put in uh whatever
we want but the various integrated circuit options are we have either a simple one
or a regular
or advanced
and uh the price goes up
as we go down obviously um okay so the good thing about
uh wh wh why why we would want to use advanced u why we might want to use advanced is that
l c d s can only come with the advanced chip um the we need regular or
advanced for uh scroll wheels
right um and the chip basically includes the infra infrared sender
yeah uh besides this in electr under electronics uh also
the company has started making a sample sender which is did not explained what i what it was
but i'm guessing that uh so they have a sample sender and a sample speaker
so i'm guessing that uh the sample speaker is probably something like um uh you know as soon
as you press a button it it mm uh give gives you feedback one five or whatever
yeah on um and uh i dunno whether sample sender sender has to
do something with voice recognition or not but anyway so these are the different options that we have
okay so th that's that's basically now now uh i think that uh we can integrate um
uh you know uh the user interface uh and uh the marketing things in that
keep uh taking out things from this and uh underlining things that are important yeah
yeah yeah sure sure yeah
right

yeah it should should do it yeah
that's nice one
mm
mm
uh sorry uh can you go back for a second um uh are you sure wha what this means a spinning wheel with the l c  display uh oh yeah are th
oh okay the ipod thing yeah
uh it's the ipod uh kind of uh
alright right okay okay
so instead of going down you just spin yeah yeah
uh huh
right
mm hmm
right so maybe i should include that here as well l c d s um plus spinning
mm hmm
right
mm hmm
mm hmm
okay
so um uh maybe uh as you're discussing things is it okay if we just uh keep highlighting things here
right so mm uh so it yeah so probably voice recognition
is is kind of important right um and an yeah
okay i i have a point about l c d  i dunno if it is the right point to take it up w uh l c d s are basically
for feedback right to the user who's pressing buttons and the feedback can come through television itself so do we need an
l c d  on the remote
mm
right
right
that's true yeah that's also
right
mm hmm
mm right
okay
so now we seem to have a consensus that l c d s are definitely the way to go because of style and
right
you you agree maarika yeah yeah
so l c d s yeah definitely go on

mm hmm
right
mm
yeah we we have we have rubber but there is a problem that i forgot to discuss with the um with using
so if if we use uh latex cases they won't allow us to use solar cells as an energy source
that is the constraint so um we could use titanium
wood or plastic uh or uh
yeah w energy source
yeah tap it on the desk yeah
mm
so probably double curved surface is the way to go yeah
or or curved at one end and flat on the top because i i'm not sure if it is flat on both both the sides then ho how much easy would it be to reach for buttons etcetera um
yeah
yeah yeah singe single side curved or double side curved does not say too much does it it uh
mm
uh i think uh
right
right di now did it say anywhere in your research material about this sliding stuff uh because um
according to the information that i have i think uh the onl only options that we have with the case is are these three
uh eith either we have uh a flat surfaced uh case or a curved surfaced case it does not say anything about
uh whether technically you know this this stuff is available at all
right yeah yeah
right
okay
cool thanks
yeah let's let's try to r rub off things and yeah so um hand dynamos are definitely out right
you you got a wind dynamo yeah
okay um kinetic energy does seem to have some kind of uh uh appeal but uh
it's
yeah as against a watch which constantly keeps moving this this thing will have to be tapped every time which which might be very frustrating for the user
kinetic energy it needs i don't have too much technical information on that yeah right
okay let's keep it option uh keep an option yeah um the flat co completely flat case is definitely
out right it has to be at least curved from one side yeah
um okay we still have all all the options wood do you think wood will be a good idea
mm
right
yeah if if it is really thin if it is really thin it it's likely to break it's it's much more uh

right
that's true
yeah
yeah okay wood is out
right
okay now for the really interesting stuff the interface right so uh the the push buttons
is is our expertise uh in the industry but uh it seems to be out
of trend you know nobody seems to be
mm right
oh if if we have l c d  displays that opens up a whole world you know if you have an l c d  display then mm you can select almost everything on the l c d  display
right
okay
mm right
so uh in in the buttons we have for the channels also we have options do you do we enumerate everything from zero to nine or do we have just uh channel plus channel minus just to just to scroll
the numbers
right
or on the l c d  we can you know
okay so mm
alright
right
okay so buttons definitely in but oh shall we uh try to draw a prec um
uh okay
okay okay so the components right so uh what about the the scrolling uh
mm um
i'm not sure it'll be a good idea to construct the whole thing out of rubber uh i it
or or at the corners edges just the edges covered by rubber or something like that everything else in plastic or even titanium if we want to use it
mm hmm
right right
right okay so so that gives us a more trendy look as well um
right yeah and uh we're going more for the trends than for the usability anyway right so
i'll rub that out
and uh colours can be provided with the case rather than
um but we still need to te think about the colour of our remote as such you know just keep it black or
mm
okay um okay if you g go over to uh the integrated circuits uh
since we're having l c d s there there's no way that we're will be able to um what we do need to consider however
is that the price is going up for the ever every such thing that we are considering but since l c d s seems to be uh
a definite yes so it seems to be one area where we would want to spend
so i'll rub off the other two
oh is oh the constraint was uh yeah
yeah so
i think uh we'll have uh uh using the simple battery will
be a safer option as compared to the kinetic energy one i mean a although it does seem uh interesting
but it does not hold any advantages as such for a yeah
okay uh okay so r we understand this better now that uh the the speaker is for the feedback right it it says uh the things that you type in or something like that so
ye yeah we we don't have too much information about it um
yeah okay so so th this is in as well then the sample speaker
right
flat on the top
yeah
okay
i c s uh integrated circuits
yeah
uh um we we're definitely going in for voice recognition as well as l c d s mm
right
yep

mm
mm hmm

cool
yeah okay


does that mean like a wind up one
a wind up remote
you could make the hand dynamo into an exercise bike and then people could exercise whilst watching t v 
yeah and stop worrying about the whole r s i  from the remote thing 'cause that's just
yay
did you say wool
wood oh right
yeah you'll understand why when we get to my presenta
sony
sony ericsson mobile phones has it
mm

no it's got its little camera in there plug it in
's a
ugly
yeah you can't
oh it's like the ipod
g yeah no you can it's like it's like where you you know how you have your your mouse and y you go round and i it's kind of like that and you spin round and it yeah it is
you just go round and it is a bit weird at first but it's actually very like fast
i like the the wheels that click on the side you you get 'em much slower so it's quite good if you like searching quite a lot of stuff do you know if you're lookin if you're th scrolling through the a  to z  of your music and you're looking for something at t  then it's a lot faster than the wheel but you've got a lot less control over it
okay i've put the copy of the presentation in um the yeah
cool
fabulous okay cool um so what i did was to search the internet to come up with market trends and you know what users are gonna be wanting in the the near future okay
right now the first aspect is apparently twice as important as the second aspect which is twice as important
as the third a aspect so i mean the the easy to use thing is fairly low down on
the which i think given the target group is what you would expect really
um you know people want something new something technologically innovative and different so the
whole idea with the l c d s and the spinning and the colours and the voice recognition is quite like quite the thing to
go for and um yeah it wants to look fancy fancy look and feel so
yeah yeah
mm
depends how fast your television runs really don't don't you think i mean we've got one of those um telewest boxes
and you put the number in the remote and then you wait and then it goes to the t v  and then you wait and then it comes so i it actually takes
quite a long time and if you get the number in wrong then it's a bit of a pain so i think you know a screen on the remote
would probably cut down your time on that but like remotes do tend to get f thrown about a bit
you know
yeah
and i it would be like i mean if you could make it integrate with the t v  then it could come up with new information about what's on and you could just see that on the remote rather than
yeah
but um i think maybe a way to do it would be a similar way to how you have your mobile phone you know like you have the slidey ones and you
have the flippy ones and then the screen's protected so it doesn't actually get scratched so you can have like what looks
like a normal remote control you know or like a minimalist remote control so you got your buttons one to nine your on and off
and your volume on that and then if you want to mess about with it you flip it open and yeah
yeah so that kind of decides your whole chip thing
okay
cool okay apparently fruit and vegetables will be providing inspiration sorry i discovered clip
art um so these will be an important feature for clothes shoes and
furniture so i mean i'm taking this to mean you know curviness
do you know 'cause you don't tend to get flat vegetables you know
yeah bit of asymmetry and stuff but that would be a good way to to get in the whole um
r s i  issue in there because i mean if you think most people use the remote control with their right hand ha
right hands so you wanna you curve it so that it's suitable for use with the right hand um
yeah i'm not quite sure about the relevance of material will be spongy um
yeah but i mean y you have to
well i suppose you wouldn't get a remote uh an electric shock off your remote control if it was made of rubber
yeah yeah
if it's made of rubber you could get the kinetic energy fairly easily there you could just bounce it up and down
yeah um so yeah um okay
yeah yeah
you have to have a certain element of flatness i think it it depends on the whole ergonomics of it you know it's like how you put your hands so y it's the least movement basically
no i d i don't think it makes a lot of difference i i have one of those s slidey phones and i mean the back
is essentially straight but it's curvy so besides you have four sides to a thing
so i mean does curved one side mean one side is straight and you know curved two sides
means the whole thing is just a big curvy p thing
yeah
yeah uh it's it's more about the protecting the l c d  which i think is where it came from but no my research didn't tell me anything which is why we have all the pictures 'cause i had nothing better to do with my time okay cool
uh combine style with a level of functionality um beauty and practicality and a thing of beauty and p function
okay
it's about the practicality of it really isn't it you know i mean if
i can't imagine a m wooden remote control
well it's not very cleanable either do you know it's it's not a practical i mean it's it's alright for a table but for a remote control you know
and splinters and stuff and
it just m doesn't make any sense i think is the thing with wood
you have to have some push buttons don't you
g yeah yeah


yeah i think this is going back to the the graph at the beginning that i made where you know the buttons that people use all the time you want buttons for them and everything else menu driven
yeah
yeah
g yeah i would think buttons yeah
it's it's the i think the thing is so if someone just wants to turn on their t v  and put on a channel
then it should be easier to use than any other remote and then if someone wants to you know change
the contrast on their t v  and they should be able to do that and it should be accessible but you know
i mean most of the time i mean there's a limit to how much the biggest techno geek can spend fiddling with the t v 
i think is the the the issue there
e either or
g yeah
i would say the s the s the spinning goes at a high speed to th to the scrolling wheel so you have to decide whether you you
know you want to be going so fast or not but i mean the the thing with this whole if y you're planning on making
it out of rubber on the basis that it's spongy then i'm not sure how well a scrolling wheel would work

yeah but y your spinning wheel tends to go to one side
you want an outside of rubber and then open it up and
or maybe like interchangeable cases
'cause i know like we're going back to ipods again n the whole spinning wheel but i have like a you know obviously my ipod's not made of rubber but then i have a little rubber case that goes over the top of it and i can change the colour theoretically to match my outfit
yeah i think the spinning wheel is definitely very now
yeah
that doesn't fit in with the whole vegetable theme though
yeah but i mean do you think we could incorporate the colours of the company into the buttons and then make the colour of the main remote
the colour like vegetable colours do you know so you could have like i mean i suppose vegetable colours would be orange and green
and some reds and um maybe purple and that and then you'd pick the buttons
in company colours to to match with it

so are we discounting solar energy because rubber's gonna be used in there somewhere or
if solar panels with the rubber
yeah okay so we lose that i think
yeah
it's just a gimmick
yeah sure j
sorry do you want me to
what does um i c s  mean
okay cool so it's advanced integrated circuits

imagine it would be inside so um actually that could like really cut down
your thing so you've got your outside which is like minimalist and then you open it up and you've got a screen
and a spinning wheel which you can incorporate buttons into um so you've still not got
like a lot of stuff in the
you've maybe got you know like if you're modelling on ipod you've got five buttons and a wheel and four of the buttons are in the wheel and the other one's the little bit inside the wheel yeah
cool i'm gonna go and sit on my own
i know i'm hated
i've got a bit tangled up in all this
excellent so um i sent you the agenda
it was on the in the project documents i don't know if you got a chance to just have a look at it anyway it's
the meeting's gonna follow more or less the same structure as last time so we'll go round
each of you in turn and you can give your presentations on what you've been up to um
and at the end of that we need to discuss what you've come up with so that we can
make a decision on the key remote control concepts so that's we need to know about the
components' properties materials the user interface and
any trends that the marketing expert has been watching
okay um do you wanna start again let me we've got forty minutes
you haven't made a powerpoint okay
mm hmm
let's hope the pen holds out
mm hmm
yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah
okay
mm hmm
and charging their remote yeah

uh yeah
mm hmm
for a remote 'cause you
yeah
yeah
yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm okay
wood wood a fluffy remote
huh
mm
mm hmm

mm hmm
okay
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah
mm hmm
excellent do you wanna stay somewhere near the board so that if we need to you can sit down but just we might need you to leap up
what are you powerpoint or
okay
do you think these pens can give you cancer of the hand some sort of radiation
yeah
right interface concept
that's fine
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm


mm
mm hmm
it's yeah
yeah
uh huh hi yeah
it's like the like you said no the scroll scroll wheel
uh huh
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah
yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
excellent okay straight to trends and then we can discuss it all at once
the project documents excellent if you two could both do that as well in case we need to refer to it
here it comes
okay
mm hmm
okay
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah yeah sure yeah
that's over on the interface if if you could put
yeah
and maybe the l c d  and spinning so that means we need an advanced thing
mm hmm
mm
it it is also quite nice though to to have something here so you don't interrupt the picture on the screen so if you're watching something
yeah rather than having to interrupt your viewing pleasure
mm
yeah
and then you can flip it open
yeah i think so
yeah
right

yeah and possibly even uneven like not not symmet yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
something a bit squishy and
yeah and it'd help if you drop it it protects it as well
to some degree
uh huh
or if we want to use the the latex then we have to go with one of the other um power things
from from bouncing it you can have it as like a little ball to bounce that flips open
mm yeah
uh huh
mm
yeah 'cause the
yeah
dunno
nothing to open them

anything else what've we got
okay so
looking at what we've got we we want an l c d  display with a spinning wheel
yeah rub off some of those
yeah it's not that's not streamlined and sexy having a having a wind up
i think tha
depends how much how much movement it really needs pr presumably if they're suggesting it then we could use it i'd i'd keep it on
we don't want that it's no it's not not vegetable

mm
mm
yeah and given that we're we're looking at more spongy material preferences i ha would think maybe rubber or plastic is more
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
mm hmm
just for fast
yeah
yeah
yeah
and it yeah l  l c d 
do we need them on as buttons or do we need them as l c d 
buttons
mm
yeah
yeah
i think that's what you guys are gonna do next so if we put down the key um things that we want
just spinning and not scrolling i would say
yeah
hmm
but if you've got a if if you've got a flipped thing effectively it's something that's curved on one side and flat on the other side but you folded it in half th that would be on one side uh huh
no i think it's just the casing rubber on the outside
yeah
yeah
mm

mm hmm
that's right that's what they're after
mm hmm
i guess
bananas
mm hmm
green
yeah
we need the advanced yeah
yeah
yeah
mm hmm
that was the
we can't have solar panels with rubber so
shall we go for if we're going for rubber we think uh on as our case and then
yeah
we've got five more minutes
mm hmm
yeah
yeah mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah i think if we can if we can include them at not too much extra cost then i'd put them in but if it's
yeah
it's from the company so
yeah
okay and the case is curved on one side but then flat flat so it's flipped into each other
can i pull the thing out the back of your computer
just so we can
nothing it's right i'm just
there we go
uh oh now i've gone too far
yeah
we're on our way
okay so we've basically worked out that we're going with a simple battery
the advanced chip and a curved on one side case
which is folded in on itself um made out of rubber and
the buttons are also rubber we're having push buttons on the outside and then on the inside an l c d  with spinning
wheel and we're incorporating voice recognition that's our overall concept
and it's gonna look sort of vegetable and be in bright vegetable colours
i think it's on the
mm mm yeah
on the
mm hmm
in the centre yeah sure okay so now we've got thirty minutes before our next meeting
in the meantime the industrial designer over here is gonna work on the look and feel design
which i'll presume he'll work out what that means um the user interface designer will work on the
user interface design and the marketing expert is going to work on product evaluation
and as well as that the two designers are going to work together on our prototype following those instructions
that we've just come up with using modelling clay and you will get extra instructions
from your personal coach is that all okay and anyone who hasn't put their their presentation in
the project documents folder it would be good just so in case we have to refer to it
y ah nobody wants to talk to you unplug yourself
i dunno maybe i would car



so what was what was this k ka
okay
mm hmm

um you mean this would be like the the overall shape of the remote control yeah mm hmm
yeah mm hmm mm hmm
mm hmm mm hmm



okay
okay
um i have some powerpoint yeah
oh
'kay
okay
okay um to be honest actually i mentioned some some of the things which which could fit
on the on the this talk um this time i m i mentioned them already in the previous talk so um
yeah this time um i might not have them on the slides but i i can just mention them aw
again okay
so um i thought um i would also include the definition of user interface um so it's
the aspects of a of of a computer system or programme which can be seen uh by the user
um and and which uh the mechanisms that the user uses to control its operation
and input data so this would p includes things like shape and size and buttons and um voice
recognition as well and colour and so on
um um the method i employed this time was a again
having a look to related products and mainly on the internet and then um
analyse them uh from the point of view of user fen friendliness and also
um whether their appearance was was pleasant um
and then um this uh this um
this can help us to decide which features we want to incorporate in our product so some findings um um
so in in the case of many user interfaces they're just so full of buttons that it's actually
uh hard to find the ones you you really um want to use and um and it's just confusing
it takes y know time to learn um okay and i thought
i would just quickly show some of them that i found
okay some of them are here um well the picture is not very clear but as you can see there are actu oi oh oh oh sorry for that
's go back
ah no please
okay so yeah they're quite big and have many many buttons actually of the of all these
i personally p prefer this one because it's it's the smallest and and with with least uh
with the smallest number of buttons as well and i would say even the appearance of some of them is kind of
not so nice um okay
so let's carry on with this um
so uh um o other findings um some new things um used
uh some of them were mentioned already by our technical um designer uh
our own company has developed a new in user interface uh wait no this is not the one
okay there is a we can uh include voice recognition and um it allows i it's possible
to record eighty different voice samples on it uh so uh
this uh this one was already mentioned uh the l c  display
um s another new development is a scroll button which was also th also already mentioned and uh our own manufacturing division ha has uh designed a new um
uh programmable speech uh
mm sorry uh speaker unit i guess it's it should be um and this means that
um once uh uh it it it comes together with a voice recognition but it's once once the
mm um gadget uh recognises uh the voice of the speaker there can be a um
pre programmed answer for example you can pick up the remote control and say something to it like hello and it says
some hello and your name or whatever so i mean this is also one of the n dev new developments which
we might consider if we wanted to include
no no the scroll button is a different thing i i have a picture if you just a moment i'll
i'll show you i wasn't completely sure myself but i think it's just like um it's it's a wheel
it's like not separate buttons look this one here but i'm i'm not really sure whether whether you can
really turn it round it's like you press this or this or
uh huh
mm
uh
okay and the personal preferences are pretty much the same as as as last time it it has to be small simple
okay we decided to include voice recognition so to have the standard uh major buttons
like on off um ch the channels and and then um volume and then the rest
would be a menu on the screen
um and i i also thought uh if we want to keep it small and nice um and actually i
i quite like the idea of a scroll a scrolling button i thought it could be for for voice like i dunno
it mm like on a um i like it used to be on walkmans or something there is uh
i think there is no reason why we couldn't use something like this for for the remote control
so yeah that's uh that's it
yep yeah
mm hmm
so it could be like a rubbery yeah uh huh


thanks

yeah uh hum yeah
yeah it's yeah

n wood is i can't n how do you uh i mean you can't keep it really small uh you can't make it like thin and
the wood thing because you need to you n you need to put all the technology in so i mean if the case you add the case and it it becomes a bit bulky wi mm mm yeah
yeah yeah
yeah
u yeah wood is not really yeah
yeah
yeah yeah in the case of remote control not really
yeah but you um i think for for the channel numb uh channel numbers you still need them wouldn't you
yeah so for channel numbers but
but i th yeah but i think the l c d  display is kind of yeah it's faster with a m yeah and
w if we dis and when we s um discussed that we might like this flipping open thing then i mean y you can
use it as a normal remote control but if you do want to use l c d  then you flip it open but it's it it's more time consuming
yeah
no no i mean mm we we definitely need the the numbers because it's uh otherwise people don't want to flip through all the channels um
yeah i would say buttons because it's yeah
i
yeah
mm hmm
yeah
yeah but n i i'm not completely um completely clear uh i yeah about the spinning wheel
so i think it it doesn't make sense to have both like a scrolling and spinning thing it's uh you can al
include everything in the spinning if you yeah yeah in that case
ah but i mean you can
yeah i um i think so too i mean the case would be yeah the case would be rubber and the the buttons
rubber buttons but then
yeah

mm hmm
yeah i think we um it was a a requirement that we use our um th the colours of our company so would it be like yellow grey and black or something or
yeah does
yeah banana's yellow yeah definitely
mm hmm and the buttons as well i think yeah
yeah but it it i think it should be quite cheap because it's from our own company yeah
mm hmm
yeah
um

uh huh so w w would with have the spinning wheel inside with the l c d  or would it be on the outer
okay
mm hmm
yeah okay
mm hmm
mm yeah
mm hmm
yeah
mm hmm
hmm
so but shall i move away first or shall i stay here with we need to
yeah
so this was that face to face meeting um but it uh it doesn't
there isn't th so there are things in the eye tracker record that we definitely don't want in the g d f  format um
like the frame rate eye movement you know we we uh uh i we're
if we're expecting the g d f  format to be um sort of a parsed version of
events and you know there's just too much raw frame f frame rate stuff coming out of this you
wouldn't prob you wouldn't want it in this kind of format for up translation to the other things yeah we yeah you can get back to it
yeah we're not throwing anything away this is just the stuff
yeah
yeah but the th but the way to think of this is this is the data that we want to be able to analyse against the other tracks of data so the data that we wanna compare with a language or with whatever and um so
yeah s so in essence what you would then do is
well we're not doing frame rate at any frame for well maybe we are i don't know i i had thought we were yeah the eye tracker does but
but right w what w um the kinds of events that we had r uh
before talked about putting into the record for then use in elan and n x t  isn't based
on saying every x  seconds something you know give me give me what's happening every x  seconds it's more like you know
give me the fixations and the um the blinks yeah oh yeah durations are in there but it's
not there's a difference between um saying that something is in a particular state every frame whatever the
frame rate is you know ten seconds a minute you know that's that's one kind of w way of looking at data and um
a parsed version of the data which isn't at um any particular length it relies on this really close
frame rate that's underneath
no no the time the time is still in there but you'll get uh what you want is to figure out what are the um the concepts
behind that data that you want represented so rather than saying the eye was at this particular place you know
here and then a tenth of a second later here and then a tenth of a second later here you say there was a fixation from this time to that
time and there was blink from this time to that time and
okay
mm hmm
right so there's two issues here we're not throwing anything away but the question is what tool would you use to get that information out of the data would you be so the more you can plan
mm hmm
yeah
mm hmm
so you need to know the percentage of time it was on during that fixation
yeah
okay so the percentage is i i is a cut it's not something you're using for measurement it's a cut off for whether or not it counts as a fixation is that
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
right
yeah
'cause all you wanna know is whether they were looking at the same object in the period after
yeah
okay can we draw it to make sure that that um that this is satisfying ellen's concerns
well there's a white board right we love this thing see if the pens
work so um this is um a 's eyes right and
b 's eyes and i think what you're saying you should probably draw this right is that they you know if
um from this time to this time they're looking at triangle one
w what you're saying is that you want to know in the critical you wanna know after they're they're looking at triangle one what's happening in this period with this guy right
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah so
mm hmm
alright

so
yeah
so you know he might get triangle one there and no maybe this one's gonna overlook lap quite a bit so what you want
to do is be able to define um bigger periods which is
the period when they're sort of interested in triangle one overall right this is sort of some meta level analysis
yeah but that's that's not a something that you can do in the n x t  query language but it you can't do
that in any you know this is such special purpose s but it's easy enough given the data format for any of these things to
do that so you could do it on 'cause i it's just a matter of i the hard part is deciding how close together these have to be before you decide
that this is a event that you wanna pull out because you know algorithmically you're you're
already putting together i mean this is essentially already you know these fixations with stuff in between
and uh um you know we we've got an algorithm for deciding when that's a look i guess you already have that or no
oh yeah yeah so it's all fixations they're these are all fixations and saccades but within the yep so
that's easy enough so the hard thing is they could be moving their eye arbitrarily here right and you know maybe
even having fixations on other things yeah
yep
back and forward yep so um this isn't yeah but what you
need to do is we we can already build into this g d f  format these regions if
you can give a definition of what you think that is but i think the right way to do this is to be able to inspect the data
in um some tool and play around with the definitions because you won't get it right the first time
yeah
mm hmm and uh elan's a reasonable choice for that right what you need is something well no because you need to
y you need to be able to see the effects of this
so i g i guess this is a case of craig writing some scripts so robin having some ideas about what the relationship is
and saying you know add this data a automatically it i mean it's not that hard right it's just
there'll be a bunch of these you'll have some rules about how maybe how long you spend on other objects and w whether the other object
is um the existing construction or not right and so um
ah right so if they if they uh they had a fixation on c  you wouldn't be worried but if they had a fixation on
yeah they're yep but yeah they're gonna look at the clock um and they're gonna look at they may look at completely irrelevant
mm hmm
yeah
but that's like a separate analysis right so
it no no the so every separate
yeah
mm hmm
yeah
but what we find e what we can get out of the data easily at the moment is at this kind of level
right and then it's a case of defining algorithmically all these other transformations that you want so this is one uh we
hadn't thought of adding before but we should right which is um well how would you decide whether something
was the current addendum uh the cu
so that's a human decision yeah um
but the ex
but we believe
but we believe j p  to be defining that maybe
yeah
mm hmm
i could believe them yeah no taking an interest in that
i mean the general division was language here and other stuff there right
i'll just i'll just minute that
oh yeah eye tracker here yeah i mean we know that

well yeah but i mean with transaction coding on something like this you would use i y you wouldn't consider it verbal analysis exactly it'd be verbal plus action because it's a task breakdown it's just a segmentation
yeah but you wouldn't have you you wouldn't do two codings for task level one you wouldn't do transaction coding in a action segmentation
i i don't think that's realistic because i think what you'd actually do is use um the full record of what you have and do a segmentation i think it'd be hard to understand what was going on if you used like just the language without watching the video to decide whether we're breaking down the task
oh you don't want it to be coding th uh based on that though and then that seems a strange way to go about things i mean this the language events are multi modal right you know they're they're doing all these things together
wha why do you care whether they can do it just based on the the language is
well it seems to me much less important than the other things one could get out of this data but i you know i it's a possibility we'll
yeah well i c i can see maybe wanting to know whether you can do the chunking just based on the actions without the language in cases where they use both it's more g i can't quite see why it's important to know that they can do it just based on the language when w you know that they had both
uh huh well i think that one's just bound to fail but yeah
really
okay anyway

so back back to this main problem which is yeah w the record that we are getting
in the first instance is about the m about these you know they're looking
at some region of the screen defined dynamically and then we need some way of knowing
what the you can you can see adding these other analyses about you know they're they're jointly focused on this region
and trying to figure out what s percentage of time they're looking at it as adding new tiers of information to either the elan
track or n x t  they're they're both sort of track based in this way
um but the hard part is knowing how you wanna do that and i i think in the first instance what
we're trying to get into the g d f  format is just this and then we've got no option but to uh figure out a way for like
to look at this just explore this data suggest ways about doing it and um be able to play
them back and see um when we think we've got these things right i don't think we even know what the set of these things are
that we want much less how to get 'em yet so th
yeah that's right so this is not the you know this is something we're aiming for but this isn't something that affects what craig programs for the initial g d f  translation um
yeah so let's just return to this question of frame rate because this is the thing we were not planning to um transfer
into this format so again you know what a frame rate kind kind of coding is ag it can again be seen as a track
but it says it's a coding like this right where you say it's in state a  state b  state c  state
a 
right so you right so i'm just you're happy that it's not gonna have frame rate uh like this it's gonna have an interpretation like this
what does that mean sorry
right
w right but it seems to me it seems to me that ellen's concerns might mean we need to add more information to these tags because um you know this thing in itself is th bunch of fixations right with saccades
fixations and the percentage of time those fixations cover you might want
okay
so number of fixations percentage of

no no this is this is still um uh summary data they're he's we're talking about
just adding attributes to these things that say the number of fixations that counted as that looking at triangle one
right so y it's possible
yeah the spots'll be different anyway 'cause i you're not gonna g have the same pixel so um we have the option
that we can put in an a  fixation thing here right as well if you want the smaller if
you want the smaller coding in in here so that it's not just parsed into this idea of which object but you also
have the raw fixation um data we can put that in as another track if you think that that's something that you might want to look
at in one of these tools that shows you the tracks against each other
yeah i d that's all he asked for yeah well i think
yeah and in n x t  there's no cost right because the y the uh you just don't choose to load those all we're doing
is dumping it as output that you can load if you choose to um i g s you know so if they're things that you just
know are crazy and you're not gonna want then we don't do it but otherwise we go ahead and dump 'em 'cause it's easy to dump out
the fixations um yeah
okay so it's the number of fixations the did you want the you
m not e well if it's each you have to d you have to break it down into another tier right you can't you can say there were three fixations and they averaged uh a certain time but you don't wanna
d well what about the the overall sum of the durations is that i mean which way do you want to
yeah then that's that's the way you want it that way around
okay
and uh y did you want the percentage of time fixated as opposed to which is sort of another view of this number you can have as many of these as
yeah well it's not um the the extra cost of having these as attributes is not high
so um you know it saves you i uh having to do write scripts to do arithmetic
on that later if you know that these are numbers that are gonna be useful to you
mm hmm
yeah
i don't know
well well but y those are different tracks of information so what you want is one track of information about which object it's one one about whether or not it's on the other guy's gaze and one about whether it's on um one of the mouse positions
yeah but i in in the analysis you should treat those as completely separate tracks of information because they can be looking at they could look sim simultaneously at somebody's mouse somebody's gaze and some object right so
yeah so the these are independent so so what we want is
whether they're looking at s at the other person's gaze right and say they are in this period well
i mean uh they're probably not given what i've trying to
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah so g so there's there's a lot of tracks here right because well we just added this fixation track
and then there is a 's mouse not their eyes is on an object right and the mouse might be on triangle one
but it doesn't matter i mean i the mouse we're just saying where is the mouse you know it's on this object
and then um a 's eye is on well a 's mouse i guess
right a 's eye might be looking at a 's mouse here
a 's eye might be looking at b 's mouse here right i mean these are all the different ways of taking
cross products at the things that could be co located so you just treat 'em as independent and i'm guessing from what you say
yeah i guessing from what you're saying you want all these tracks yeah which is fine there's no problem with that at all
yeah
s so um uh you kinda got the idea here yeah
but the important thing is you don't treat that entire set as mutually exclusive and exhaustive it's just so tha the objects is like a separate level of analysis if whether they're looking at the objects than whether they're looking at the gaze 'cause they can happen at the same time
does that happen
oh right
uh huh
okay so what you're saying is like a new problem for us which is i'm gonna change
that's the bad one
yeah so you're saying
okay can you write on my pen pad just say yeah pens
white board pens so you're saying you know they could be looking at um uh square one at this point 'cause they
close together
okay that's a problem for the data models and either of the things that we were using
what do you mean by greatest overlap
draw uh my g my uh spacial reasoning is no good
see uh i i'm the one that uses the white board 'cause i actually put the the microphones on
uh this is the better pen

uh huh
yeah but you had a way of choosing which one right
so you just mean which i is it closer to the is the circle i mean what is this circle they're looking at a pixel or something right
right
s right oh so those vary in size yeah yeah
mm hmm
yeah they could be
oh but what pain that's gonna be analytically because it's gonna how many parts are there like

okay i know ways of getting around this analytically
'cause you c
if they're really close to each other it's gonna get foxed yeah
it's not the data format i'm worried about it's the um the way you do the analysis because you don't wanna have to say
um you know did they jointly look at triangle one okay did they jointly look at square one okay did they jointly look
at you know you need some way of uh uh going over the whole thing but i c we can find ways around
that i think for now we we do it this way and then we we think about what we need out of it in the end it's just you know in elan
it that has the side effect that if you go for the naturalistic way of of up translating to elan there'll be a zillion
tracks and it'll probably ruin their viewer 'cause you'll get very sparse data on each track it'll be like the old referring
expression generalis uh uh visualization um the map task you know where they talk about
one object one landmark and then another landmark well it's big right
well we'll see if elan likes it or not
yeah and we b we better also like have in the representational list of par like even in the n x t  up translation a list of parts it it affects the way we do the n x t  u up translation and make things easier for people
well the
and it suddenly becomes and there could be more than one construct at a time right it's there is no the construct right
what why does it why does construct one become construct two when you add something to it
yeah oh and this is because we don't want it to stay triangle one when you start with a construct it's not a construct at all it's just a one thing and we don't want triangle one to suddenly have bigger stuff
yeah yeah there are there are
mm hmm
yeah that was the next question i had yeah
oh yeah
mm hmm that'll cover most of 'em
mm hmm
i yeah it's triangle two
you don't because that's you'd have to have human coding to do that yeah there might be multiple triangles that you've broke and you won't know which one they're planning on using it for
well you know which mold they come from and so you know which shape they match but you can't possibly know which one of the ones they're meant to replace
oh so there's no two parts with the same shape
then
oh same shape and colour right okay
oh okay so you can tell what it's meant to replace then because it's the same it's uh just a case of the mold right
yep
yeah but the this also
mm hmm
mm hmm

yeah we in when you specify these things do you specify the molds or does it figure out what the molds are based on so is this hard wired into tim's program or is it just an artifact of the way we s
right okay
so it's hard wired
so minor modification needed for
mm hmm
uh but what were the req wha
has multiples yeah
mm hmm mm
yeah uh but they don't have enough to make unique
mm hmm so what
yeah
mm hmm so i th
i think we've gotten to the point where you know to try to summarise uh we
we think tim's program can do both of these conditions that you want but i'm still worried about what the uh
effects are for analysis because you were aiming at something in um the g d f  format and i wasn't
quite sure what and w
yeah so so okay so i'll summarise what we said about that part that um every
time you cast off a new part from a mold or you know every black triangle has a different i d  and
you know it's a black triangle 'cause you know which mold it came from but you don't know which part it was intended
to replace on the screen because you can't mind read
what do you mean define
mm hmm
mm
i think that this is a human coding that is part of the action coding because i don't see how anybody but a person watching this can guess why they cast off this thing at this time

yeah but that's okay 'cause they all have different underlying part numbers and when you say what a construct
no no no
yes
mm hmm
yeah so we can easily look at things like that automatically it's just the why they g why they get new parts that's the problem for us we can't if they suddenly if they decide to get a part of a mold we don't know we can't know why until they do something with it if they do
oh yeah you said that um
yeah but you can
but you can break you you can but you can break one when you break one you don't cast off the mold yourself it happens automatically oh okay never mind then
so they just have to use it yeah
uh huh oh but they have to drag it up past the mold line yeah
mm hmm
yeah where there's extra parts
yeah
okay so this why question doesn't even arise because
'cause you know what they're gonna do with it when they decide to move it past the mold line they're p doing something with it probably and you'll know what they're gonna do with it because
they do it
yeah
how would you do that
yeah but there's there'd be no way of coding that automatically right how could you possibly do that
but that's a human coding right
mm hmm
so w
so uh that's gonna particularly be a problem for j p  right remember m all the things we're looking at are f with language with and without language and it's gonna be very difficult to tell whether they broke something intentionally without the language which means it's probably not
yeah okay but th um this is properly part of the action coding so we should well we should make a wish list right as a side effect
mm they could discuss deciding to break something and and then one guy does it yeah yeah
mm hmm
no no it was them just dr uh forgetting to um define an attribute they had to
well whi which is probably a documentation fault right
yeah
yeah
is there a y yeah well while we're on past things is there anything else you wanna tell us about the prior part of this which is the you know what else is he holding you up from
uh huh
right so it doesn't slow down the eye tracker it doesn't do anything nasty so we we p so we pay for it and
nothing important and noth nothing big enough they're gonna look at it right
yep yeah
yeah yeah i know oh do you need two copies of camtasia to do that
so you're gonna look into this right
well y c look at the licence conditions it might not
i c i never pre judge licences until i've read 'em
so uh well and um hold on before we get go any further so this has implications for data storage right because
w um it means we've got well no this is three times right 'cause we've got oh no we're gonna build we're gonna use
javascript to build the videos on the fly right 'cause it's fast so the the permanent storage is just the camtasia
stuff so uh is that a problem
where are we putting things
oh we can we can put 'em in the same thing right
you can dump 'em into one video frame if you don't mind losing resolution but that's maybe a problem right because
so the synchronization's gonna be a problem
yeah before the task
no
so
these are ba these are back ups right so the flash get allows you to hand synchronize them later if you
need to by stripping extra video off the front as long as you make sure you start 'em before the flash
then you're fine but it will there's a a cost of having to go to back up which is synchronizing
them

oh okay so you so you should start the camtasia really early then
right okay

uh huh
that's not where you're putting it i mean u
well okay you've got the proper sound record but you're not dumping it through camtasia to record it right you're
what before we were gonna use camtasia at all what well what we were gonna do what were we going to do with the sound
uh huh
so uh ha wou is there any sound degradation that comes about from putting this through camtasia rather than running it out straight
okay so what you're planning on doing it is bunging it on one of the camtasia tracks and then splicing it off the camtasia track
it's an easy bit of yeah
and then you're gonna bung it on the other camtasia track too if you need it right but we'll just we're gonna store all three separately
then and the sound is going to start at the same time as one of that arbitrary one of the camtasia videos
but you'll know when the real experiment you'll know the relationship between that and the eye tracker timings
yeah no human intervention required it's time stamped
yeah but ho hold on do we need that i mean it i i thought the way that tim had this set up originally
um the audio uh w the time stamps used there would be joint time stamps
between the audio and the eye tracker so that you know uh the audio record
ten seconds in was the same as ten seconds into the eye tracker record so that we didn't have to do any extra hand work you know any
uh chopping the starts of audio signals to get there was nothing okay
so we're relying on your matlab script to get us the chopped version of the audio right
right so we can either adjust the eye trai track data or we can actually chop the audio signal to take off the first whatever however many seconds
yeah but uh but d um the uh lining up the camtasia two is gonna take
we w he's working on a matlab script for the sound but not for so the one that's got the sound on it that'll also tell
you where to chop the video to get it to line up the one that doesn't have the sound on it it won't
oh so it's just got the bleeps oh okay so w no hand synchronization required at all um as long as the scripts work right
'kay how confident are you about the finding these things
so we just have to w hope we don't have an any subjects with the odd vocalizations
yeah okay
yeah 'cause this this is the drop out test yep okay
yeah yeah

mm
oh yeah
i know but so you g you got a solution for that then
oh right okay yeah
you're sure there's not a better solution that involves
'cause you know people might wanna use this for speech recognition or something you never know if it's the data is there then
you know
yeah
and you're gonna want forced alignment
oh no well no no better to collect and sort
uh well it's the mono
wait wait w i i thought the sol that a better solution was fixing this problem with the mono microphone socket sound card
so you said the problem was the m it the m m i is expecting a mono microphone input
so is that fixable like is there any way yeah uh i think a new sound card sounds a better solution than monkeying about with trying to filter white noise out
which isn't hard
but hi but it's only got one input right
i believe it's easy to put two monos into a stereo signal yeah so
yeah yeah
so is there any reason why we wou don't do that
yeah well it's in the old days we probably would have want a little if they'd been in the same room we would have had a little stereo thing in the background as backup as well just to make sure 'cause it's slightly dicier you know if his scripts don't work then you don't get the overlap
it doesn't have to be a real trial it just has to be two guys talking in the two bits and then
we've both been so badly bitten in the past

yeah
but this this sounds reasonable to me i so i think
yeah
do do they both have the same sound card problem i wouldn't count on it
okay

oh
well uh yeah i think tell the guys
to yeah yeah
yeah
mm hmm
yeah it's just the way they wired it
so um it's getting late and i've got a two o'clock and i've got a nice lunch so i wanna eat my lunch today
uh what did you wanna get through today more i mean i think i think it was useful going through your expectations
about this 'cause um that's quite a bit clearer in my head at least and
but i think mostly we leave you to go away and re design the g d f  or add new bits to
the g d f  along these lines and then w
yeah yeah yeah
but i think the thing to do is um for you to go away and think about it this way with the different tracks for the different objects and the
um the kinds of things we've added about whether they're looking at the other person's gaze and what have you and
and try to change the spec so it it reflects this and maybe um oh maybe by that
point there will be some sample data or something uh and the right thing to do is for us to
look at the sp the spec the way you understand it now and some data and then ellen'll have new
ideas about what's needed or about these post analyses you know the and then and we can add 'em in but it's
gonna emerge over time i mean that's clear
oh so the spec to the other conversation yeah
yeah that's that's solved now yeah test we have to test
well you don't have your models or do you
yeah
yeah well uh anything you actually need fixed
you know
joe doesn't live here anymore right so
well i but he wasn't gonna be booking any time to us after the thirty first of october so um
that that means that any bugs that need fixed are now craig's responsibility right you don't know have any change on that right
'cause he that's what he said to us originally so i would assume you know no more contact with joe it's not fair to get work out of somebody for free so you know ask craig instead
yeah
i don't think
well w he wasn't paid in advance he's being paid in arrears so it doesn't matter
uh i think it's
i think it's better to have all the software i mean it's not big things it's just maintenance at this program at this point and
yeah i if he can give it you know like because the problem is you gotta have an immediately when you discover a bug in that and we can make
craig shift all his other priorities to do this 'cause we bought him right
yeah so it's a kinder way it yeah
yeah but it sounds like you don't think there's anything that actually needs fixed at the moment because w we only need this to work well enough that you can use it for something and you got work rats so
and how many models do you need to completion and how long does that take
and you got
and you know about complexity
you're waiting on marloes

you can cold call her today this afternoon
mm hmm
that's her job come on


oh yeah
okay
so you can dash in there for half an hour at a time doesn't sound very useful for you
uh huh okay well you guys sort it out
mm hmm
right but it would be kind to tell her ahead of time which of your morning sessions you're bumped yeah
mm hmm i thought that was the problem that your mornings weren't sliced off on the booking system
'cause you know i if you're sa told use the booking system
yeah and what are the instr what are the people upstairs downstairs have um i you know as
rules about who you hand the keys to 'cause you know we like people to know to ground the
oh i thought the the lending for the booking system caroline
see 'cause you're supposed to uh have training in
oh okay so that's the safety and you control those accounts oh okay that's fair enough okay
uh huh yeah that's safer 'cause then they learn the first time
yeah yeah okay i really have to get out of here so um what else is important before you run
nothing right
you got uh willing heads
oh i don't think i brought my diary up uh but maybe why
okay so
yeah
mm hmm
hmm so do you know what time of day you might want 'cause i should c i should check that
okay
you all have to b you'll have to be there to when it falls over
yeah okay
so that all sounds f good fun
well i can just leave you guys here you know
why not
which data you know i i want everything and then i'll decide what i want
okay
we can get back to it we can get we can always get back to it we're not th actually throwing anything away and if we decide to re jig this at some finer
mecha method we'll still have the original and a method of uh of filtering so
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm mm hmm okay as long as the format in which
we pick it up is a format which could be generalised to a finer take because the worst thing that can ever happen to you is you discover that
you've done huge amounts of analysis and th you actually had the data but you threw it away because you treated it so grossly
okay so whatever we should be able to b you know backtrack and say okay instead of every
second every tenth of a second or some such thing but
you know th
well the eye tracker does
mm hmm
well you need
well one needs to know the duration of these things right so one needs to be able to say
mm hmm
mm hmm
well so there's no real time there's only ev there's only events what i'm we're trying to figure out is whether we've thrown time away
here
okay so one of the formats in which eye tracker data is analysed is percentage of time spent on some target
as opposed to some competitor over the first second after some event okay so you actually have to
be shu have to show at some time slice rate whether the eye was on the
same target as the other guy a similar target what we'd both been deali you know so we have to b we have all the parts
the interesting parts of the screen identified and be able to show distribution of gaze over time
alright now we could be really unlucky and somebody would expect us to do that at the real frame rate
but i think that's really unlucky but but my point is that we mustn't throw away in or lose the capacity of being
able to deliver that kind of data mm hmm mm
s so typically the eye will move right so over any one second they eye's
actually f fixing on a bunch of different things and you and so when you say the eye was on this from here to here
what's gonna happen is that is that if you use the real frame rate it's gonna jiggle all over the place it's gonna be on this landmark uh it's on
this object that object this fixed thing that fixed thing okay you're gonna get lots and lots of stuff and it's
percentage distribution that you're going to want it's not uh i went here i s you know it's not like person walking i went
here i stayed here it's it's more like a fly hovering
mm hmm because if you if you take them as separate events you get thousands of separate events
mm hmm
against bigger frames
well that's the that's the problem there are two ways of doing it one is that there's always a cut off right but the other is that there will be a time span a kind of reaction to some event span
right
right and so i mean there are there are really two ways of looking at this one would like to know for example the percentage of time
overall in which two people are looking at the same thing okay and one would like to know sequences of
they didn't look at the same thing and then they broke it or they did look at the same thing and then they did or didn't brea you know one one could imagine those
two categories that's that's a kind of testing of our hypotheses but there's
a certain amount of um dues you pay to the way they do things in the literature
to get your papers published and one of the things they will want to know is an event series after some critical event right what
percentage of time is given to looking where the other guy is looking and what percentage of time over some you know reasonable time
span of a couple of seconds alright so they'll be they they'll want to see essentially the gaze settling on
particular incidents on particular places so we have to be able to deliver those two things and they're rather different demands
right
or how l alright let's let's imagine a
typical construction event okay there is some part
there are there are separate movable parts on the screen ready for use right there
may be or not a construction already begun right somebody makes the first move
there's some kind of communication either gestural imaginary or verbal that plans how we're gonna do it
right before that happens the person who speaks is going to do some kind of visual scanning
while they're speaking or communicating in some way the other person may or may not be looking where they're looking okay
they may be overlapping gaze at particular objects which are of interest let's call it the c the construct existing construct
which could be zero
alright or the um the addendum the thing which is next going to be added
next piece okay now in neither case when you draw this he's looking at triangle one which you're
actually drawing you know for a the period of time in which he's steadily looking at triangle one is gonna be very very short
right because staring fixedly without interruption blink or or saccade is is
an extremely short event
that's fine so it's in a region it's in a region okay but even so you're
likely to get bouncing in and out of the region right so even so you wanna look at if we're interested in
how long before the construction move takes place um how much of the time they spend looking at the
same thing let's call that our measure of alignment so they're gonna be yeah that's right a  is gonna be on triangle one
and various other places that's right and and b  um okay and
we're gonna look at the percentage of of that time where they're both in the same region
right so what i want to make sure is that we don't um simplify do you know what i mean temporarily simplify too much so that yeah
'cause then you lose percentage as an as a as a d v 
right and so b  has some periods of looking at one and all it will which will also be intermittent because
right
mm hmm when they should be right
okay
mm hmm
well
it
right what
yes yes because for example for part of that time both b  and a  are probably looking at the
construct okay if if your intention is to move the red triangle to sit on top of
the thing already constructed you would tend to look back and forth right
and we should be able to to figure that out
yeah sure so so the question would be under what tool should we be looking at these events so
right so so essentially there's there's um a e  is divided into t r  one and c  and other stuff okay where c  is the construct the existing thing
well no i mean we'd take a separate we'd look at the percentage time i mean i have no idea because i don't know how people look when they're
building things together okay so there's a there's the addendum and the and the co the existing construct
and i don't know whether they're gonna spend more time looking at one or the other but if they're whatever it is that one is looking at if the other's looking
the same place they're in good shape
yeah sure sure and that's what the other stuff that's what the that's what the diagonal stripes are for that's true
but we c we can one of the things we'll be doing is um categorising people i take it or
interactions by the amount of time people spend looking at the clock we'd expect that if we put people under time pressure they'll look at the clock
a lot more
sure it's a separate analysis but you don't wanna throw it away right so so you can define if all of these things
are actually categorised by the eye tracker as to where the eye is alright you should be able to pull out
any interesting category and say alright for this phase it's t r  one or c 
for this phase it's um s q  one or c  okay
mm hmm
mm hmm
you have to actually transcribe the thing or watch the film further on yeah yeah absolutely
yeah
right right yeah that's the addendum in the construct should be you know kind of they
they change their true identity but they're i their categories of stuff now i w
my kind of assumption was that that this was j p  land that that's what he was re what he was really interested
in was the kind of coding which would define the building sequence okay so and
the and maybe he wants to think about that more and say well there were several candidates for the addendum
alright and and it was the negotiation of which candidate was gonna be the right candidate that's actually the interesting stuff so i should
talk to him about this he's he's actually um emailed me with a l with a list of things he wants to discuss at length
so i w i'll bring this one back to him
well this is my question for him is he gonna define this kind of building sequence in a way that
we can get out or is he so b i mean you know they've been working on construction there
for a while so it may be that they have a coding system that's ready to go and we should just apply it
okay um they do a lot of sub assembly in the tasks they've been doing so they may well have a yeah
let's find out
right right so wha right what well we but we have the now actions
i mean actions might mostly be theirs right but since we have the the eye tracker i th we're gonna
have to answer their questions about gaze right yeah i right but um
so they'll they'll uh they'll tell us something about that but um presumably what you piously hope is
happens here is what happened with um transactions right that the verbal
analysis and the um and the visual analysis give you the same breaking points the same chunking
points
well i mean what you know it's it is it is a task breakdown but for the verbal version there are ways of announcing that now we're doing a new one right or that we're finished with the old one
no you wouldn't but i mean one of the things one of the things you'd like to establish you know as an as an outcome of this is that you could analyse either end and you'd get the same chunking of the material the thing which you guys thought to make in a paper
it's a hypothesis
well
they are doing these things together but one of the things that you one could imagine doing is um sen is
you know having the transcription there and pl just play it back to a bunch of captive undergraduates
and say when do they stop and start
um because because essentially you're looking at um cycling sequences in discourse
and if the discourse tells you what's going on that's information i mean i g one of the questions is how the information is gonna be shared across
these media and if you can get it all out of the speech you know if the if all of the chunking is available when there is speech
okay then it's carrying a lot of the burden it's saying we are done with that and
mm but this is but we haven't looked at data like this with this with our old fashioned analyses um
you know and i it's it would be really nice to know that that much information that chunking of the task information
is being carried by the language because j p 's question the overriding question is so what's language for you
know if people are busy interacting all the time and all of our colleagues don't even bother to control for whether
people are talking to one another when they're doing these joint tasks because it seems to them to be irrelevant 'cause language is irrelevant
it would actually be nice to demonstrate that in a place where we're controlling whether you have language or not you could get the entire chunking of the task out of
a language
mm hmm mm hmm
mm hmm
because you know it's a self contained system as opposed to a system which is which can't be interpreted without the other system
okay usually the claim almost all studies on language claim that language is a self contained system which will give you everything you need to know
that's the claim
alright i didn't say it was true i said that's the claim and so it's worth testing
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
no no and we won't and establishing the full set will you know take us much of the project so you know
fine my only concern w uh you a as i said when i barged in was just to make sure that we didn't lose the things that we might need to pick up later that's all
every single frame
well
okay but since the l the definitions of look a thing we're looking at are d um
are the ones which get rid of the lower level like jiggling around in the area of a particular
object right so if we're moving the the green triangle um we've defined
a region which is the dynamically the green triangle wherever it is we will jiggle around in there but it doesn't matter where we are in there
that's beneath our level of analysis s
well the in that interpretation is definable to frame rate by our by the only way we're gonna use frame rate
i c well i mean i because i can i can say for how many frames this fixation went
is officially defined so that as long as i as long as it's not a untimed event okay
a and an end time so it's you know it's fine i can say it's a long one or it's a short one or it's you
know it's twenty milliseconds more than that one that's
mm hmm
mm hmm
and okay i'm i'm asking you as an expert this is this this isn't a leading question this is a question question why would that be informative particularly
uh huh
mm hmm
uh huh
on it so you think that if for example if they're looking at um one or another um apex
of a triangle it would just that would make a difference they were exploring the
thing as opposed to they were simply alright there is it there it is okay so th um
so that really means that we're not throwing away absolute fixations
the screen location of absolute fixations
alright

uh huh as opposed to out of it so you so i thought i understood you to mean
exploring the figure because you know your fixation is a point and the figures are bigger than points so you could be exploring
the figure or you could be just somewhere in the region defined as the figure but not on it
okay alright fine the
so you just want to know the variability of the of the fixation and wouldn't that differ from person to person
okay so it's the number of different spots within that region where the eye has fixed the number of different fix oh ok okay so it's a jiggle rate okay
right
mm hmm
well all i th understood you to ask for was the duration of each fixation inside yeah
you can come back
okay
right
so it's the number of different fixations
well actually do you want the average duration or do you want the number of different ones
duration of each fixation in the region
well you've already got that
so that's a measure of jiggle in the region roughly
moving
okay
what's our error of measurement on location on the screen so to what degree
do we actually know whether the two little eyes little circles are exactly in the same place or just
somewhere in the same region
right okay
right
mm hmm
it's yeah okay right
s
okay so my question was going to be alright the the mouse is a dynamic object right the eye track is a dynamic object or is it only the the piece that the eye tra the other person's eye track is on that's that's an object in this definition
is a is an object okay with some with plus or minus something or other yeah around it some circular area okay and
um so you can be on the object but not on the other person's gaze so there can be
a triangle which has a 's gaze in the centre and your gaze
actually happens to be here you're in the triangle region does this
okay
but it's directly added when when these two in this situation when these two overlap right like this
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm mm hmm mm hmm well it would come up it would say yes right i mean because they
would be in the same place so if you y you're gonna have dynamic regions which overlap one another by definition if the mouse is
on the construct then right right
right
we treat those as as other objects but the difference between them and the the
parts of the c thing to be constructed is that they're allowed to overlap with other things so nothing breaks
okay if we mm hmm
ye
mm hmm yes as opposed to simply looking at somebody's gaze when the mouse isn't also there right and you want to know those things right they're i they're independent dynamic objects
okay so a definition of we're all looking at and touching the same thing so imagine that we've just added a piece to the
construct alright so now that's the construct and
both mouse symbols are on it right and both gazes are on it
right so at that point you should have a line up of a  is on the construct a 
is on the mouse a  is on a  is on a 's mouse a  is on b 's mouse a  is on b 's gaze and b 
likewise okay
right
ooh i love the eraser
mm hmm yeah but the mouse is also a dynamic object

that's fine okay
mm hmm
mm
mm hmm
right
and then you then you look for combinations of them yeah
i think we need to because tha some measure of alignment is looking where the other guy is directing attention and there are two measures of where the other guy is directing attention that you get from the visual track one is where the mouse is and the other is where the gaze is so
mm hmm
right
right
so
yeah that actually true be 'cause
right but that it's also gonna be the case that um whatever region you define as the region of the dynamic
object of the red triangle may get to the point where it overlaps the region of the dynamic object of the green square
okay what do we do about that
yeah because if you have them close together there's always some fuzz factor around them and so if they're left lying close together
okay or in the in fact in the model in the not in the model in the in the supplies set they're actually
neatly packed into a little space
mm hmm
mm hmm
squeak squeak yes

because the two are so close together that their regions overlap
mm hmm

the greatest overlap with what
ho ho
i think i think you're throwing information away
yeah but it may be a bad idea it may be a bad idea you've just thrown data away
yeah j
well
the gaze will wobble the gaze will wobble that's natural
mm hmm
or indeed they might be looking from one to another d or deciding which one to choose or thinking so you don't want to decide it's only one and throw the other one out
mm hmm
okay well that's fine that i was going to say that's the obvious way to do it
well each one is yes or no couple of dozen
right
six to a dozen usually
mm hmm
yeah i mean i think it's very likely that um if people are considering f mm hmm
well not if the regions overlap okay if the regions i
right and if you define the regions so neatly that there's that you know that we're losing gaze because of jiggle outside this closely defined region when it's in the middle of space then
i mean i i actually like the solution however ugly it it looks in terms of a data format of having a track for every possible object of gaze
mm hmm
s a thing mm hmm
well okay so
mm hmm
uh huh
mm hmm mm hmm i always thought that was brilliant yeah
it is big and you do have to scroll through it to see what's going on but it gives you a very clear picture of what's going on yeah well
okay but so we'd we'd better do a test one and and listen to them scream
with parts
right so i mean so
mm hmm
okay so what about the point where a part becomes the construct do you still identify it as a part i mean i think one should lose that i take it 'cause
mm hmm
mm hmm
right
so you cha so every time a part is added to the construct it becomes a new part so the construct
actually um has say it has six things that are added to some initial thing
okay so if there's just the initial thing you've put it in the middle of the screen that's just the initial object right
soon as you put a part there's a construct but it's construct one because when you add another part construct one ceases to exist
and you get construct two right so actually defining all of those as the construct
is gonna be the trickiest thing
right so you're you're looking at triangle one right and all of a sudden it ceases to exist
'cause you can build sub assemblies and then you can start again also when you when you screw it up you g start again
because the definition
mm hmm
well the problem is that all of these things are popping out of existence so do we know the difference between um we broke it and it went away and um it's now part of the construct
can we ta can we tag the constructs with what's in them
yeah
okay so we could we could essentially well then we could cumulati or it is a new construct 'cause it has a new list of a new cumulative list of parts right but we will
right so
so some fancy programming's gonna have to be done to say i was looking at triangle one and now i'm looking at triangle one in construct one 'cause the first construct was triangle one and square one okay
alright so now we have to ask whether um
so l let's imagine this we've made a construct of two parts and we're c i a triangle and a square and we're considering now adding something on to the side of the square that isn't attached to the triangle
okay
are we looking at the square or we looking at the construct
yeah
uh in this definit should be looking at the construct there isn't a way to figure out that you're looking at the square rather than the triangle
mm hmm
it is
well
okay because i mean that's that's the example m f presumably that's the best example of overlapping
overlapping areas 'cause if if the thing the two s the two things are now abutted of course there's an area which is common to
both of them okay um so what i'm trying to run through in my head is that we
can always tell the difference between um something going out of existence 'cause it's joined to construct
something going out of existence 'cause we threw it away right suppose we pick up an we we we
screwed up the first time we put the triangle with the square and we threw it away and decided we didn't like it
and we took another one is it triangle one is it triangle one prime or something like that it's
the replacement for triangle one
mm hmm
well how do i know what it replaces
n n
uh this is true but if i have triangles one two three right and i throw them away any triangles i take out are to replace one two three
okay
except that ex no you don't know which one they're meant to replace but you know they're not meant to replace any that are all that are that haven't been thrown away okay
right so the new parts are replacing those which have disappeared from the screen and if there's no more t r  one track the t r  one track is gone now
oh there are many
same identity
oh is that true you've decided not to make all the triangles red and squares green and
oh okay
right one two and three they
okay so
so there
so shape plus colour
okay
they're unique all the parts are unique so wai hang on that makes the task a little bit easier right
the uh all the lines so
indeed which kind of leaves you with an obvious way of making the same task harder and easier doesn't it
but but that's hard to code i mean that's really a thing we might do okay so now let's make sure that the coding would survive
that it's just it's a beautifully controlled situation the construction task is essentially the same it's the figuring out stuff
that gets harder if everything is purple for a just to choose a colour at random here
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
so if you have five black triangles there gonna be five black triangles in the parts box or one
uh huh
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
okay as long as it this is possible so c that that just is a kind of thing which is so simple
so much like a single one zero variable change that it
if it that doesn't already exist 'cause i'm tr i'm trying to kinda map this onto baufix um and baufix has
has multiple you know all the the
the the v the nuts are are red or and all the um flat things are wood colour something
the same part the same part is different colours oh yeah
so when you say a red nut or a green bolt or a long green bolt then there'll be lots of them lying around and i think that's how the robot is set up to there are five five green bolts uh here is one you know
okay okay so
okay so w uh all i'm i'm doing is kind of worrying out loud about all the things that will happen that we'll miss
by th a simple view of for example regions and looking at at triangle one when is triangle one not
triangle one anymore um does it s keep its identity
mm
identity yes
mm hmm
that's true so how can we define the shapes that people build
well
if assuming i was for a moment i was j p  and i wanted to know how they actually went about building the thing
okay and i wanted to um to look at the strategy and i wanted to see if the strategy was different when we could talk about it and when we just picked up whatever i mean suppose i can't talk to you and i'm doing this task with you and i can't talk to you um
the thing which is gonna be hardest for me is making elaborate plans with you i can reach for the next thing and you can go
where i reach but if i have some you know sub goal some long term sub goal of doing something clever
with putting these together 'cause it's hard and then putting these together 'cause it's hard there it's gonna be almost impossible to convey that to you
and the difference in the history of construction right is an important
thing and i wonder how we can get that information back
do you think
no it why is not uh that's that's not the question i'm asking the question i'm asking is what's the history
of the construct so you have the n the names of the things in there and you have two constructs suppose we have two sub constructs
and whichever one had two pieces put together first is the earlier numbered of those constructs right
how do you tell the difference between adding a piece to this first construct and creating a second construct
mm
okay
it's it's it's parent child relationship
okay so construct two could b um construct one is um a red triangle
and a green square construct two is um two green squares okay
construct three right is a red triangle a green square and another
red triangle construct four okay
okay and you can so how are we gonna tell when for example you think we're gonna have to do human coding on when two sub constructs are put together no that's a definition wherein a construct has a c has constructs as children
okay
okay
right
so we could zip we could zip through this and look at all the um all the interactions in which people build
sub construct contstructs first which we expect them to do bu as a wild hypothesis
more when they have verbal communication than when they don't okay and we can do that by simply searching
for any constructs that have constructs as children
okay
mm hmm
yeah we haven't actually made a rule that you can't uh collect extra parts right
no no i mean you have to b you have to break one to get one okay
and you can't just bring extras in case you screw up you have to screw up first and then you can bring an extra
mm hmm mm hmm mm mm hmm
i but it does have replacement
mm hmm
mm hmm there there's a so you so so you appreciate you appreciate the cost of
screwing up
mm hmm
mm hmm that's right right okay so they rejected something or they broke something inadvertantly okay is there a way of
telling the difference between intentional and unintentional breakages
bec yeah
no you p they both put they both put their hands on a construct because they don't like it
mm hmm
yep so that just has to be coded
mm hmm
um not generically because they'll if they're gonna do it by gesture they'll build up a convention right
what else do we need to know
unless they develop a convention suppose they start off with language and then they they say hey look you know let's do it like this
sure absolutely i just i just wanna make sure that a wish list yes yes
for sure you know that's and l or well n is not necessarily intentional they could just screw up yep
mm hmm or i don't think that's very good no we'll never get away with that we'll get a bad score let's just throw that away and start again yeah
okay
which reminds we have fixed the score problem have we
right
was the percentage overlap and that made the score
yeah that's when i left oh yeah well do you know which which which which one was the top right yeah mm hmm
but that's all been fixed that's that's that's back
don't tell me it was a feature
alright
oh okay oh so
hmm
but
the right
not prominently flagged okay a communication flaw okay so we can now that's now just lovely and there won't be any crazy scores anymore
oh i have to use a new page
alright so the last i think i'm sorry you know i had as assorted emails from you and i was probably didn't catch everything the problem was that there are two camtasia records
they don't see their own gaze they see the o only the other guy's gaze right
huh huh
okay i mean
check out
okay so we
mm hmm
is there mm is there such a thing um as um you know dual track video because
you can certainly mix things um what ideally one wants one doesn't really want to l to have these things uh
um because we're using them for back up and for coding we don't really want to play them independently we do almost
always want to use them in exactly in parallel time aligned
um what are we doing for synchronization otherwise
okay so that we'd have to re align them we couldn't dump them from their start points well maybe you could
the thing that you're dumping them onto just starts running with the flash and the bleep you turn on the two copies
whenever at different times but they're still no is the what what i th what are they
i don't really understand the the parts that are operating here two videos are turning on there is no
time stamp that comes from some common source
mm hmm
right
right okay
right is there a div mm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm so they'll include things like the um the eye tracker calibration
right which is not a bad thing actually because sometimes you wanna go back and find out if this was just a particularly duff subject
right yeah and hand every time we re calibrated the damn thing slipped yeah
that actually helps i mean that ni
right yep
mm hmm
right no they that actually saves you hours trying to make somebody's data smooth out when it won't because yeah that's a technical term that's a a technical categorization in psychological research
and that's because

well we need sound we we need real sound recording right that's that's two track that's stereo
alright
uh huh
on w on what uh sorry uh
on one of the
con
o o it's uh
on camtasia
that's our only sound record
mm
mm hmm
how good is it
yeah have to really question
mm hmm
and then then they can do sound analysis on that
oh okay
right so we there's gonna be a way to sooner or later to align the eye track camtasia one camtasia two with two sound channels
right
mm hmm
ah the bleep we'll find


mm
right
right right they uh they also tend to have a funny funny shape beeps so
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah is there an end signal when you decide it's all over does it ping you back and
right okay so when you've when you've pressed we're finished it pings back at you okay
it's just that all kinds of crazy things happen when you're running things and so up saving a percentage of a trial is sometimes a good i you know being able to do that is sometimes a good idea okay

can w
yeah can we do can we do something better than that like having
yeah
yeah i mean it's it's crazy we're in an anechoic room which we specially yeah built an anechoic but you know sound room which we specially built for this we're d in good circumstances we shouldn't screw it up more than we have to is there anything we can do to improve this
no no no do you have a powered microphone or something

right
that the line is stereo the input is mono right is that what you said right
is ah
that's somewhere in the sound card
yep

its own track its own video you have to align the videos anyway right
i
well i'm not the technical person who would do it but i know who to ask
mm hmm
mm hmm
but it's the same as
mm hmm
says robin thinking about cutting and splicing yeah yeah okay
mm hmm mm hmm
yeah i wanna see several of them i wanna see i wanna see one of them um look really nice before we start running subjects can we do that
yeah
yes that's right
i just wanna know it works the way you expect it to work this is not a a gesture of mistrust this is just experience that
um if anything can screw up it will i
i'm trying to choose my language carefully because we're being recorded but you'll hear more choice language at the
point when we've all done a lot of work and and then we discover we can't use the session because of some thing
we didn't think about right um
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
right and then then we combine


yeah it's probably worth mentioning this to the to the guys in the garage in toronto right to say mm hmm
mm hmm mm hmm
mm hmm
uh huh
right
i think that's a if the documentation said it w could record in stereo then i think we should talk to them about how they've done this is you're not sure from the documentation what it says it can do
mm hmm
right okay
okay
mm hmm
yeah
right
right
okay
right
right
right okay so when you i mean uh given that there are these events recorded we can use any of them as the beginning of any of them as a start point for example right um there are also motions being recorded of objects right
mm hmm
right
mm hmm
okay
right yeah
so i'm right uh that that that's great i i'd before
we break up for lunch i just wanna make sure that tha that i know how long it's gonna be before we're in run
mode okay so the sound thing the sound thing is stands in our way we need to be
recording sound online okay so that's a thing that has to be solved the shape thing is solved
mm hmm
we think
we believe right so that's that that that should be done this week um in fact
like tomorrow for example um the shape all the shape problems are solved generating shapes
no problem um scoring shape overlap no problem nothing is problem there there
are no visual display problems
mm hmm
yeah they had their
they had their inspection last week um j p  staggered away from it and
ah

mm hmm
okay s
um i haven't i haven't had any discussions with him since
well he's ph he's physically here if we want to pay him for some more time we can do that would that be a just better use of our time in get
yeah
right
but m he he he is around and i believe and if if the if i if it's a
right but if um if everybody has a lot to do and you know joe could give it a couple of hours which i is what it might take just to fix it then let's do it because starting run time is now getting to be fairly urgent
mm hmm
mm hmm
right right but we can't we can't make joe do this ec alright so there's uh some trade off between availability and speed from start to finish given that this is somebody else's code so you know
right so we're we're b we're building models right we're we um
we have the design somewhere
mm
hmm well
mm hmm
okay
yeah i think so 'cause um i have to check back with
with j p  fairly soon okay he wanted to kn um
the eighteen the next eighteen month plan great deliverables great progress with the experiment well that's what we're doing now okay so what do we think if you have a fairly hectic week are we looking for subjects next week
okay
ads go up yeah i do i do but i think ad should probably go up this week we want
people for n for next week is that okay is anybody now terrified at the thought that we're live next week there are people
coming in here one after another or p two two after two more likely
yeah yeah okay is the is this is this generalised is this generalised anxiety robin or do you have
a specific thing that okay so aside from the usual
angst which we all suffer when we go live so we w we wanna do some piloting at the end of the week
right
okay
right s
right she's using but she's actually relaxed that somewhat yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
ostensibly booked time which isn't
okay we've but we have we have a solid booking for all the mornings anyway right and l except by permission
of us alright we own it um so we can change that i mean they everybody
acknowledged the the other week that we that we had priority oh yeah yeah yeah yeah oh
yeah yeah oh yeah yeah don't worry um there's there's a booking system right so it's public what's
booked and what isn't
okay
no
alright maybe w should get on there and book mornings as far as the eye can see alright
uh huh yeah just a well we think we spoke to all the people who who used those facilities
the other day but we could be wrong so
huh
right
um well the two key holders are here
oh i see
from caroline or the general office the general office i see
but no they need a they need an account on this machine to actually to use it they need account on these machines so that
they could book they couldn't actually log in mm hmm okay we're also working
on a way of making sure that the matin that the machines return to zero state when they're
when you come off them because the it's the people have been leaving var um well people have been leaving various bits of who knows what around
on them right which which we think is what's critical
okay
um piloting piloting piloting you have we have to build the things we have to try the machi th things we have to
check them with marloes and j p  that they like the representation the variables right
how about uh you have any time on friday
i get a email back maybe you and i should be the pilot subjects first pilot subjects the ones who um know which questions we wanna ask and then we should get another pair who are naive to the whole thing
okay
this is generalised floating anxiety no no it's it's it's wisdom but yeah well
um because actually we can i mean uh you know if we make comments they feed back in a lo into the
development
uh five hundred hertz though

mm hmm
yeah
uh m m i uh i yeah but the p sort of start and end times
will give you back to that output a as a and then you just measure it against
you know the c the c yeah the cumulative total time record or something so
mm hmm
b uh uh m yeah so i'll i'll lag in some of it during the i suppose there's the the saccadic movement itself for example
th th th yeah the it should still come out that the little sketch i asked this p for
for last week about n x t  and whether it would have that sort of tiered effect so you could see the overlap of where one person
is looking compared to the other and their mouse movements and things that that should ra uh address
all that mm hmm but but because it's also in the i based on the the time course of the
procedure you'll be able to basically get the scan path of the pattern of events from that as well
yeah yeah so i did have it somewhere i didn't have it r uh haven't brought it trying to remember it




mm hmm
the
uh it m it m uh but uh br at that point they're all of it lumped all
the individual fixations as long as it doesn't move off that triangle together as a total sort of gaze
gaze time on that yep yeah that that's a target within the target region
uh m
uh huh
m yes somewhere
mm hmm
it it sh yeah it i mean uh as long as we're dif r yeah it there shouldn't be anything missing
that should be alright
yeah
yep
m m yeah
yeah yeah yeah
mm hmm
yes
so we yeah so we if we have an an event yeah that that yeah the second line then for the second before it and then we can just take that chunk out and do something with it
that should i i
right
yeah
mm hmm
yeah yeah
uh well if it's just based on uh like a a stable fixation for so long or or something and crossing into that region yeah
yep
mm hmm yep
mm hmm
mm hmm yeah
to mm hmm don't know

mm hmm
more mm hmm
mm hmm
well he's really interested in
mm hmm so which one does
mm hmm
mm hmm that's what i have understood it to be but well i don't know but w uh mm hmm mm hmm
yes uh huh yeah

it's mm hmm


mm hmm

you can we can announce now
mm hmm
mm hmm well


uh but y y y
you mean to the tags of the data w within it yeah so so things like fixation the number of fixations a and
bi um yeah with some some measure of the so we could work out the number of fixations that made and the average fixation duration as well because having st long steady fixations can be informative
um if if they're holding their if there's less dancing around the um the cognitive
focus tends to be in one sort of part so uh there is a difference between if they even though
they're still looking at the same part if they're looking around it uh rather than just holding their gaze steady or
um and longer on it
uh yeah it yeah it's it's certainly it's it's worth mm hmm
uh no i wouldn't want to throw out
put the actual location
mm hmm
mm hmm
i mean presumably
uh if well yes but that probably isn't going to be easy to get out because you'd then have to break up uh the parts somehow
yep mm hmm
uh it it yes it can do but it's also looking at it within their their own behaviour to see yeah
uh th w i i would say just the number of fixations i mean it could just be yeah the number of different yeah yeah mm hmm yep exactly so
mm hmm i mean to
it yeah uh if if we've got everything then i suppose it's you can always yes it's you're not throwing anything away then or
right
mm hmm

uh but uh uh number uh well the uh duration time as well somehow whether it's the average one or
of the fixation well
the the average should be alright uh to work with the the
uh well if you've got the number of fixations in the average time you can then just generate it yeah yeah
mm hmm
uh
again uh that that should be you should be able to derive that presumably from
right
uh that it can vary a bit depending on the calibration but if we're building in a sort of error margin
um it it will be based on pixels around but there'll also be a minimum one 'cause i'm trying to think that it's probably
the small the actual mouse icon is so small it'll need a slightly larger uh
just because if what you have i is a sort of larger error or of b error margin around it

uh no the o the other person's gaze position as well mm hmm yep trea treated the same as as the mouse say yep mm hmm
yes yep

yes so if there uh if mm hmm
yes
 
but not looking at their individual and pr fact they probably will avoid looking directly because if they're looking directly at it it's obscuring
the the part
mm hmm
yeah mm hmm
the
mm hmm
mm hmm the m the mouse the gaze and the part are all layered


mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
uh uh if when they get moved together mm hmm it
mm hmm
mm hmm
two objects close together your eye gaze can actually be looking at the left edge of one and the right edge of the other and they're sor therefore looking at two objects at once
saying they need some new pens
new pens white board pens
mm hmm uh unle uh but it uh unless we just define it as there's only they're they are exclusive and which ever area m has the greatest overlap is what they're actually looking at
well it w if if you've got your sort of eye position and it's it's unlikely to be exactly fifty percent in one object and fifty percent in the other
uh
well i uh uh put these things on yeah uh uh what i'm i'm thinking is if you've got say one object there and right you know so this is
thank you uh part one and part two and you've got they're sort of they're looking
there
then that overlap means they're looking at the two pieces simultaneously
but
yeah uh just if this is there's more of it uh yeah i yes uh that's w uh
that's that's a decision we'll uh uh uh i'm saying is if they're looking if most of what their
overlap is here then we stick with that one
uh that's th we no that because um the gaze position will be
a sort of fuzzy area it won't just be a pixel it'll it'll be an actual like circle
and area yeah so i i it it that's that's going to be w uh it's it's not just a single
point it's it's a it's a sort of lump target and so there'll be a bit of a a
sort uh some sort of overlap of two objects or b yeah they
could just be oscillating mm hmm

mm hmm uh i mean if if they are oscillating though then that's presumably going to st change the weight so you are actually going to see them flipping between uh when you decide they're looking there mm hmm if they're really close yeah
mm hmm
h yes
hmm
the yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
uh i it's also going to be a problem uh because you're going to have one part or a construct forming in the middle of a fixation
so it's not gonna be quite as clear if you can't can't chop it off uh huh and then it yes and it becomes construct or assembly whatever two
no you can build sub sub assemblies and then link the the part really yeah
i so each
wai w i th uh
which constituent parts
construct
you'll be looking at the construct 'cause that's the way it's dis defined
looking at areas within it
hmm
uh w
they can't replace uh the new parts only appear when the previous one's broken
yes they ca they can appear without them you c
uh with same shape but not the same shape and colour uh same eye yeah yep
well that's well that's that's what they're at the moment uh
yes so that's the way it works at the moment uh i just assume that's how ni nijmegen had set it all up
th that's that's back to uh tim's day they are individual uh you have different colours for the yep unique yeah
yes
the tam tamgrams are much easier when you can see
mm hmm
yep
it is just a construction task rather than a puzzle
yep

mm hmm yeah


uh yes it at the moment there are d uh there are two i think two small ones and two large triangles they're
actually the same physical size and shape at the moment they're in different colours that also means in
the p new parts list they're there for you know two v large triangles and two small one
small ones say whereas in in the revised edition if they were all just black there'd only be one
uh mold in the new parts
as far as i know it's hard wired it just appears so
mm hmm the polygon one polygon two whatever it might be
mm mm hmm
yep
hmm yep same same pieces
mm hmm

no so they they can have different uh nuts there w well nuts that are different colours but same part in different colours yeah
no what i mean there's more than they're multiple pieces that look the same mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
yes
mm hmm
mm hmm
and the extra parts don't appear so you can't collect them yeah there there are a couple of them that it's like greyed out they really very faint so you see the mold is there but they don't come filled uh until
yes
yes i i it appears in the new p uh like uh suddenly the th th the new part lights up sort of thing and it's there
yes they have to bring it into play
no nope that yeah that that is one think unlike the say the baufix or anything we i assume
the the baufix the there aren't any extra parts and at the moment the software doesn't a allow for that
yes replacement but no superfluous so you can't have a a standard stock
with extra parts that it'll never use
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah
mm hmm
yeah
mm hmm
intentional um in the sense that they break deliberately when they bring them into the new parts but they c you know it's like the trash can idea that they bring a

you have to hope that there's language and one of them says something you c mm hmm uh there's no there's there's no way you could tell that just from the the raw movements or or something
mm yep

yeah
it
i
although
what i'm trying to remember is if the people deliberately break things by moving two pieces together they they don't both break
they both they both

mm hmm so the i intentional thing is when they actually both click on the same object and it breaks
no they could just make a mistake or screw up yeah
y yeah but that's bringing in the the language thing again
mm hmm
mm hmm
oh uh yes at the the percentage score yeah so our yes rather than the number of penalties or or something no the the score w uh is fine
uh ye that's that's the way it's worked out but uh uh the problem was um to do with the m the p
they had a relative and absolute piece and uh it's all to s to the symmetry of that so as long as it's defined
fine yes it wasn't it wasn't a bug it it it was a
uh well uh yes it was something that had to be defined and the uh
dutch lot didn't so that was it was actually their their fault but um it's
not clear enough in the documentation yeah yeah but i it it is quite fundamental and uh
causes quite immediate problems if you don't know about it yep exactly
yeah
or oh we're well we yeah we should should go back to the beginning the um camtasia was tested last week
and initially we were a bit worried because uh in the old version it seemed to interfere with it
but uh when you when craig re compiled it and did his new version it started wor wor it seems to work fine
um
nothing we can tell no uh
mm hmm
no
yes there will now have to be two camtasia records because uh e each person actually sees a different
screen because of the gaze feedback they don't see their own gaze to the other person so there'll need to be two separate
camtasia videos generated
hopefully we won't you mean officially or uh


yeah i hadn't thought about the i was assuming we'd just get one and one licence both of us suppose technically
we should have two because it'll be two machines i suspect that it will it'll be per
machine i would think
hmm i i'll have a uh yeah i'll have a l a look at the actual camtasia licence um the other thing we're we
it 'cause it's now twice twice the size of a


uh mm hmm mm hmm mm hmm
mm hmm

well the other problem is uh camtasia has to be manually launched on both machines separately
yeah
uh during the task there is a flash and a bleep
oh i mean not during the task uh before for each task yes yes


uh camtasia y yeah but
no they're they're on two s the two separate machines and the you you start and end them separately
the they they're not talking to each other they're just recording you start it recording and it starts recording what's on one screen and
you start the other recording on the other machine and they're they're totally separate they don't know about the other one
mm hmm
yep
yes
uh yeah see how how long it took them actually that's that's true how long did it take them to calibrate or yeah how many t how many times before uh the validation worked or something yeah that's true i uh
well it at the moment the that's what i was assuming on on on doing that uh it's done first
mm hmm you go back and actually yes they were crap isn't that the answer
yeah um yes the other thing we were getting sorted out was the the microphones
'cause only one of the uh camtasia videos will actually have the soundtrack
uh we're just getting we've got one cable and to the two mics i suppose we can do it is it would it be worth splitting it
uh yeah so the at at at the moment it's ins well what we've finally just uh at
twelve o'clock today looks like we've got it sussed um is to get
one channel one microphone being the left channel and one being the right channel to merge into a stereo single
file uh unfortunately the on one
machine
 
the display p c s yeah the camtasia v video
or m m multi media thing
yeah
yes
it it's
yep it's camtasia that's recording it
yeah
yeah




yeah
yeah
yeah so so m so i assume that well once you've that sort of information you well you got the g d f  format you then filter it to say right
between time x  and time y  they're they're constructing that having triangle one to the construct and then you just say
in that time period what percentage are they looking at triangle one what percentage are they looking at the construct does that sound does that sound reasonable
yep
yeah

right

right

yeah all all the all events have a start time and an end time so
yeah
yeah
yeah

yeah
okay yeah 'cause i think that that's gonna co that's 'cause b the diagram we got there suggesting that they're only looking thing at time
so whether it's triangle or whatever else but so what you're suggesting there is they can be looking at the triangle and maybe a mouse pointer and
maybe an eye at the same time okay okay
yeah yep yeah yeah 'cause you get c 'cause you
yep
yeah
yep
yep yep okay yeah so so yeah so so it's just a matter of adding these the two mouse pointers and the um
two gazes as extra objects um so yeah as long as as long as they've got an i d  in there we can just say right
at this p between these times they're looking at that object or they're looking at the mouse they're looking at whatever
yep
yeah
pens
i confuse 'em
yeah that would


yeah

yeah
well thing is that with
yeah
yeah thing thing is w g d s  formats is wor is working at the moment it's actually got a separate track for each part so
yeah
well the
well the the the it depen depends on the depends on what you build in there's different parts there's different parts whether you're doing the tamgram or whether you're doing an airpa airplane or whatever um

but th but sa but thing is if if we if we got if we got tracks for each for each part we can we can easily analyse it down later on
yeah
yeah well the
yeah
yeah well the the the the doesn't really list part in the in the g d f  um so yeah that that that's not a problem there so that bas basically what
i've got is well there there there's places where you got the i d  though so you've the an i d  for a part you got an i d  for a location
on the screen so it shows you the target config the clock whatever else um and then we can easy add i d s for the two mouse points and the two
gazes um and from that and ba basically all all the all the tracks are doing is saying at this between this
time there's a look at this o this object yeah th this i d  um so uh so it's effectively a track
for each i d 
the th yeah the but but
well wha wha what happen what happens there is that the the two the the existing parts basically cease to exist and a new part with a new i d  starts existing at the point where they're joined
yep
yeah
right

yeah oh
yeah
yeah that that that that's what that's what that's the way he's working the moment because it uh th it's it's generating a new i d  when you c when you create a new part um
yeah
um yeah but there there's there's joint events so if the if a joint event if if if it's there's joint event linked to linked to the item then you know it's become part of a construct um of um
yeah the the the yeah the con the con the constructs are already tagged with that so that i'm act there's actually a s a separate file of the data format which says for each construct which which two parts made it made that came together to make that construct
yeah but you can still ta you can still track what parts went into it so you can still find triangle one whatever
yeah
yeah but but that's easy n uh it's easy to do because the the co each construct has the i d s for the pa the things that construct it


yeah yeah
well we'll d yeah well with the yeah d well thing is that we we still have the x  wa the x  wave traces from the ascii formats
so if if you want if you want to be able to say i'm looking at a square instead of i'm looking at the construct that's it is possible to get that data
out um it's it's yeah it's it's not doing it's not doing it in the gest analyzer at the moment but i can easily add it to give that information if you
want
yeah if if you take it if you t if you crea if you create a new part it uh it gets a new i d  so if you get if you drag a new part out of the parts bin
uh
yeah i mean the we e
yeah i mean you know whi you know which way they match so you can
yeah the
yep

yeah
yeah so yeah yeah so i think that anything's loading there's there's then two triangle isn't there there's two identical triangles in the tamgram um
well yeah yeah when you when you specify the molds in the in the in the p the file that c that generates the parts like a list of parts the molds
are bas just taken out of the the file that generate that specifies the parts so so ho however many part however many mo
however many parts there are in the file that's how many parts appear in the in the parts box
if you have five black triangles gonna be five five parts in the fi five black black triangles in the parts box but what what what but what
you can do well if in the in the initial configuration you can re use a triangle so if you so if you only want one black triangle
you just create one black triangle in the parts box and then re use that pa that triangle five times in the configuration
yep
yep
well when the when the f when the final construct the the way the the way the the constructs are defined in the file you've got like your p your parent construct and the parts that it's constructed out of um and yeah as i say the
yeah yeah so you got parent child relationship and i the child can be a part or it can be another construct
yeah yeah 'cause uh there's a joint action the result the t what you need for a join action you need to yeah a construct and a part two parts
whate whatever you're taking together and then the result of that is a construct you've got time when that happens you can see that construct appeared at that time
um and you can still track the children of that construct
yep
yeah
yeah well by by the by the time by the time they're doing that they must have already broken something so you'll so you'll know what they're replacing so
uh they do if if if what if one if one person's trying to get a part to a part that isn't that that so the part that's just sitting on the screen that's not being touched they both break
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
uh well yeah 'cause yeah c 'cause it was through the rotational part yeah
yep

yeah yeah i mean i'm
i've th i've yeah it's it's in the documentation but it's like two thirds of the way down a quite a long page so
yep but um
yeah yeah
no no the the the there's there's very small graphical bugs but it's it's not it's not big thing it's like couple of white pixels uh in the course of a in the course of a the course of a task so it's there's distracting
no

yeah but then the que the que the question is there a licence for camtasia where you just need one editing c thing and two recording things 'cause
yeah the r the recording yeah the recording thi pro program is just quite a it's quite a small program they just gen
it just generates the video and so i don't know don't know if it's worth having a look at the licensing for that just to see


yeah
yep



mm
yeah
no you got you
yeah you got exactly the same access to sound quality as you got from anythi anything else on the windows so you can you decide whatever quality you want so got a bit of
uh yeah because the the synchronization the audio and vi the audio visual synchronisation comes at a specific point in the eye track file
no it's yeah th it's i i sta stamped into it so it's just after just after it prints the line starting experiment uh uh yeah i'll i'm pretty sure it's just yeah
yep

uh well the well the matlab script uh bas just sa uh just says uh yeah gi gi gives you the times of the audio beep in the s in the signal so i just
yeah
yeah
oh yeah
yeah
pretty confident but you you've you've seen them it it was it was

yeah

yeah i don't see him with ten he kilohertz
yeah
yeah the the the there's a signal at the start and the end of every trial so
yep yep


yes it's a stereo jack it's a stereo jack but it's a mono but it's a mono uh microphone mono mono recording on microphones
line in uh sp going going through a line in so it's a so it's a lit so it's quieter because it's not as though it's not powered but it's still
think yeah we we still pick up a signal
yeah

yeah
well the the when they are they are the the they have batteries in them but i there's not doesn't but doesn't seem to be powered because the because the line in   input's so low

the so the sound the sound the s
well the yeah the the yeah the the the the jack that is that it's plugged into is stereo but when you plug in when it's recording from microphone it records in mono
and yeah a new sound card is fixable
yeah als think we we have a well i suppo i suppose it well one th one thing you do is uh re is record the sou speech signal separately for each for each person but then you'd have to pull the two pull the two sounds together

so if uh so if i i if each machine recorded its own with a recorded the recorded like the the p th the uh the user on that one
yeah
yeah oh they yeah and then the so the yeah so th
yeah it's easy easy if if nothing if nothing else you h uh if nothing else you can do it in a matlab script you just write read read file one read file two and then you just yeah
yeah but then the the the matlab the matlab script will tell you how l it will tell you how far apart they are 'cause you can do you can just measure the drift between the two of them 'cause you got a l you got a list of where the where the beeps are and then you say right this stream is like i don't know nought point two five seconds behind the other one


yeah



mm hmm
yeah so then
they've both got the same sound card
so yeah

yeah yeah 'cause 'cause 'cause
yes
yeah so the the external version's got plugs that size and that that is stereo microphones
but yeah the other one's plug's like the smaller size and that isn't stereo so the colour the colour can
do it it's just that the connectors on the the connectors at the back of the computer can't
yeah but as as far far as we can and find the the web site of the yeah the the creative labs web site and the review of it um and they weren't entirely clear but they both suggested that it is there is a mono that there there is a mono microphone
yeah


yeah i'm
yeah so and basically out the output the g d f  is just gonna be a whole series of events you know with start and
end time and the event's gonna have whatever all whatever the object uh is that's being looked at and things um and
then yeah and then it's a matter of we're gonna put whatever filters you need after that so you can say right i just want so you can
say from the time where they picked up triangle one to the part time it became part of the assembly find out how it's how m
percentages of time they were looking at it or whatever
yep so yeah so you got mo yeah there there's move events there's look events there's fixations and blinks now at the moment as well um and yeah and oh yeah and see uh looks at looks at objects and looks whatever else so um s
yep
yep
yeah yeah i will
yep
yep
okay fair enough
okay

well yeah yeah

yeah
yep yeah so we'll we'll get we'll get the get the audio stuff tested you know single microphones um yeah get that tested next couple days and i assu i assume that's not something you need me for t in terms of that


you don't you don't need me involved in the pilot do you so well unle unless unless it's a bug report yeah
i'll w yeah w i'll i'll i'll b i'll be around but yeah i'll make sure but ho hopefully it will run smoothly and yeah
i can relax so

so let's start our second me meeting on conceptual design
so as the previous meeting i will be the secretary and we
will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control
concept and finally we'll close the decision
so i will first uh
what
i i think i will let uh our user interface designer speak first mister david jordan
so we'll
s technical accessoire interface
this
i'm not sure the one in the middle is very attractive it's very big yeah

okay yeah why not we'll have big discussion i suppose after that so
okay something else
i just have one question because for the intelligent controller you said that we can use the voice recognition
or the gesture recognition but as the um expert
told us most of the people want to use the remote control to zap t to zap between channels
do you think they will be able to use gestures because if they do all the time the same gesture as you said
previously in the last meeting maybe they will get injuries because of that or if you say
channel three channel three two three four six five i think they will be bored after a while
you don't think so
yeah sure
i that's true
yeah but suppose you got a cold you have a mute remote controller
broken arm
yeah but suppose you have a family watching t v  and if they want to use their private remote control in the same time do you think it will work everybody wanting to change channel in the same time
why
if you have one brother and one sister and they want to watch their favourite uh t v  programme so they say oh channel four channel three channel four channel three all the time so
yeah but you have the remote control so maybe you can keep it f with you you're not you're not obliged to share it
yeah we can yeah
yeah i think it's a disadvantage
yeah but one other question how how much will it cost
yeah because i suppose we need to do research to have something working
some some efficient
so you think it won't cost an
not a lot for us
or
yeah but uh uh
mm mm
yeah i agree with uh
yeah but there is one problem that uh baba talked about is the international
remote control we need something that is international suppose we're we want to sell it in france
the recognition system will be able to understand french if you want to go to england it will be able to understand english so
mm okay
and with no increase in the pri production price of the remote control
yeah but how will you
oh seems to be quite complex
and what about voice recognition do we have microphones and where will be they do you think if we're far from television it will work
yeah but where is the controller
yeah
yeah but we're here it's uh an object but here you say you want to use i uh s technology
yeah but wha what is the use of voice or gesture recognition if you have a remote control li like this if you have an object if you want to use voice or gesture you need to be free without any object you just want to interact with television

yeah but you can lose it

okay you so you can build a kind of black box and put it on t v  and just to recognize gestures and voice
ah
yeah but
mm
i think so and maybe it will be quite
okay
hmm so what do you think we'll try the controllers you'd prefer
which kind of controller would you prefer to use you as a remote control user
so i think it would be better not to do any intelligent controller and to stay with the google controller or a fancy controller
maybe try to mix the google controller and the fancy controller hmm
just want to have something controller which is in a kind of intelligent controller easy to use sophisticated and fancy
you think it's possible
yeah but uh we want so
yeah but w we we want something th that works all the time every day every hour for everyone
you don't need to tune it
yeah why not if it's
not too expensive too
okay so let's go to the industrial designer maybe we'll be able to take a decision after that so
two
working
i can
okay
it's okay

uh i think there's something wrong with your
maybe you you record it somewhere else
interface concept
no
mm mm
uh
nope it seems that we have a problem with the
yeah so
no i think it will be more interesting to start with uh
yeah
you will had s some more information in i think it will be interesting after your presentation to have um baba's presentation
so
okay
okay never mind
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
okay
yeah i think it's an added value to the remote control and maybe it can attract all the ecological
k yeah consumers and but about the the price of adding this solar
battery would it be something really that will increase the price of production more no
so
okay
and what tha what about the uh
materials
impersonal mm hmm
yeah
yeah and i if you we want to put fashion in electronics maybe we can try to do something with wood
mm hmm
mm
mm okay seems to be interesting mm
yeah we want something easy to use and so i think maybe something very low level wou would be enough
and you think that we will be
okay
so wood and what about the buttons
no it's fashion yeah
i dunno i think we have only uh five minutes left participant four functional requirements
this one

okay
so we have to take decisions about the component concepts about the energy so
as you say you want something technologically innovative maybe using solar energy
and with battery would be something interesting maybe
will attract
pro ecology consumers uh cheap imprint so you s you propose low level chips would be uh enough to have something working well
case
so you think case
something spongy someth no wood
maybe you
it's it's natural
th the feeling is natural so maybe we can stay with wood
but it's still fashion
yeah something that you can into it
uh and what about the user interface concept
google and fancy
because i think that with the voice and gesture recognition there are still some
disadvantages with this
yeah but you need a receiver to recognize the gestures and the voice
that's true
so maybe we'll just focus on the google controller plus the fancy controller maybe try to mix them these
two concepts together just in one and do a remote control with solar energy
and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood
and l c d  buttons
yeah i think for these supplements the solar energy would be something quite interesting and not maybe too difficult to add
yeah for the interface something added value
with a module you mean the remote control with a mur module if you want you can just use
commands words and use them when you don't want to use your fingers
turning the t v  o on o or off
so adding some vocal commands
simple ones
okay
so the next meeting will start in thirty meeti minutes so we'll you will all have to work in
in your direction so you will have to work on the look and
feel design to have the easy to use powerful and fancy remote control
with some added value such as the uh simple vocal commands recognition
uh you will have to work more baba on the um spongy way to
to add spongy um touch to the buttons and try to find
maybe a nice shape for the wooden remote control
and i sup i think we'll have to evaluate th the product too
yeah
yeah
and remember as as i said last meeting we really have to
build a fashion remote control and uh the colour of the um the society
will be really it will be seen in the remote control so you will have
baba and david jordan you will have to work together on the prototype and you will have next time
to show us um modelling a cl a clay remote control so you will
have to model model something
and i think that some specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach
so no more questions we can close the session
yeah okay cool

mm hmm
mm
a nice one

yeah yeah
mm hmm
yeah
yeah maybe
oh yeah that's a good that's a good point so
one and


yep
yeah but yeah but the same can happen even with it you know this kind of remote control because the
that's right
it's it's
and mayb maybe we can have the switching mode to pass from you know voice controller to
manual controllers eh
no more expensive maybe
well y y you have also the language problem you know when you
'cause it it have to be universal so
yeah

yeah but you know the product the pro
it's a very smart it's a very smart controller maybe
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
but
yeah but the problem is how to s you know if this is a push button controller you can send this con this remote control everywhere in the world the same one if you have the language you have to develop for each country
yeah but for each country you have to do one because uh the for example for se
oh really that's
comple

a microphone maybe
to talk to the to the t v  maybe
i if you say one he switch to channel yeah
so well for example if it is somewhere in the room if i maybe if it is in the table there you can always say s channel one and the t the remote control gives the order to the t v  to switch to channel one
devic
yeah
yeah
yeah but so you need a camera and you know a microphone inside your remote control
yeah
but i think that you know switching from one country to to another will be a problem so although y y
yeah but i i
yeah we should
uh
mm
yeah but
i think he need a control that is very reliable so
yeah yeah
yeah
it's not really the we we can add for example some function like for browsing in internet so or something like that but uh i think a user need
don't have a the the
yeah if we can send email from it
because the p the problem i can see with with the voice or the gesture itself wh what can happen in a family i i for example if
yeah

and for all the person of the family maybe so yeah
because you have new
ye
okay
okay
yeah participant two um
yeah working design so
so
i think
can you go to the next one i uh it's not this one it's uh oth the oth so i it's the working design sorry
component design so this yeah so this is the described use what
are you inst
i don't think so
oh
maybe i record recorded directly on the
computer
okay okay yes
i can say it to you without
yeah exac
okay
yeah
yeah in fact i don't know i s because i in my presentation i don't have here with
so it was in fact the design use to show you the design of what is inside a
what is inside and what are the different component of the r
of the remote control so it will be interesting so i could show you some some picture of what is inside and so
so i in fact the the f something i want to discuss is which kind of material are we going
to use so will it will be wooden wooden di wooden remote control
or a a plastic remote control like this one so and
in which which which kind will be the the different bu button so it can
be some you know classic pushbutton like this one or you have also some button
like l c d  where you know the button the buttons are unlighted during the night
or you know you can see them in the darkness and
the other thing i want to discuss also is which kind of alimentation electric alimentation do you want to have
so will it be for example uh d uh solar energy alimentation
or will it be a battery like the classical battery so and i think that for example for the alimentation
it would be good to have
uh both of them so so for example in some country where you are in the the countryside
and you are far from you know the cities uh for example in some place in in s senegal
so if you have electric if you have solar alimentation you just when you want to have
recharger or remote control power you just put it on the sun and after one hour you can come and
so it can be interesting for people to have this kind of remote con it can be something interesting to make
people buy it for example yeah
yeah yeah mm
ecologists yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

alrigh
in fact having them both will if we want to have battery regular battery and
and the solar energy battery it could be it'll it will add a little bit of the price
but it will be an added value also that will be compensated so hmm
and the materials it depends for example you if you have a wooden material it can be more the plastic
material is more common it's very resistant but you know something wooden will be
like i don't know high cl so a special high class or you know you can have some
yeah even if it is not completely wood but just a part of the you know will be wooden in wood and it can be interesting
and so the last point is y also would do you want to have some very cheap
integrated cir circuits chips or do you have low level or or very very expensive it depends but i think that low level will be you know it is an interim module
yeah
yeah yeah yeah
yeah i think it will fit on the price we want twel twelve euros so

i think the buttons i pr i prefer you know the l c d  you know lighted
buttons because you know it's i don't know um yeah in the dark it's fashion and it's related to how
beautiful it is or uh if you want to watch t v  in the darkness or if you want to lo find your
find your your remote control that is lost you know in the darkness it's very easy so
right
i think a touch screen
will be t as expensive as the l c d  buttons so but and it is a kind of other design i mean it can also be interesting to have this kind of

mm

ah yes
yeah yeah okay yeah
okay
and fruit and vegetables yeah
spongy 'kay
okay yeah yeah
yeah but the problem is which kind of material do you need to to be spongy
pla
s
very stuff okay rubber rubber desi okay yeah yeah
yeah
okay
yeah
solar
okay
yeah
it will be a
yeah
yeah i think
yeah yeah yeah

no wood but plastic
would some
i think we can have wood for example in the bottom and you know it depends on the design we want so
yeah it's natural and i
and it can be correlated to energy solar energy so for the marketing aspect you know saying that it's ecol
mm yeah it's not right so
okay
google and
and fancy f how about the the voice and
uh maybe we can do some marketing studies asking people if they're interested and how
it it is an an interesting concept to see to have uh voice control
mm
yeah but and the problem is i i'm we can infer i if you have v voice control why not to put it directly on the the t v  so speak directly to the t v  and you don't need a remote control actually so
but it will be embedded on the t v  and not on the remote control so
yeah l c d 
yeah yeah yeah
and pf what can we think a supplement to
i think the supplement can be the voice it is just you know it is not the most important but
it can be a part of
yeah yeah
yeah mm
to push button yeah yeah even it is for s just some kids you know switching channels one two three four yeah turning yeah yeah not very complex commands but easy commands so
yeah
yeah simple ones for

expensive buttons yeah to make some new
yeah
okay fruits
okay
need it to be okay

okay
okay
sounds good mm hmm
yep
yeah
no no no yeah
mm
so uh first i will present the concept of user interface um there's three concepts in the user interface so first one it's a google controller
the second is a fancy controller the last one is uh intelligent controller so there are three concepts in our controller
um n next i will explain one by one the first is google controller um
so i want the controller to be easy to use but with sophisticated functions so it's a combination
of easy to use and um sophisticated functions
uh this is a first concept of our controller the second concept is a fancy controller
um so we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive
um they can easy recognise our controller among a lot of products so so
the u the user f the the u user interface should be very very cute
very very g um
attractive such like this there are several uh examples in the slides
yeah it's very you know if you're
yeah it's hard f i it's easy for you to remember it or to recognise it yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah so the last uh concept is intelligent we want uh we want our controller to be smart so maybe we should uh use um uh
technology such as speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology so
we need to have coop some cooperation with some research institute on speech
recognition and um gesture recognition um
with this advanced features we i think we can attract a lot of user
okay no there this is the three concepts of our controller yeah
yeah
yeah so
y
uh i think some time it's very uh convenient to use voice interface and
gesture interface than use button for example if you cannot find your uh controller you can just
uh just just uh speak something such as yeah one two
yeah
so you can use your gesture that's no problem
for limited vocabulary speech recognition is very reliable and for s limited vocabulary gesture recognition is also very
yeah
yeah they cannot speak at the same time
yeah it's very interesting
yeah
yeah that's that's the advantage of intelligent controller even you h you have the controller i can i can say channel three so it's c come to channel three i don't have to
it's advantage
how much
no no we we d we we just are use um
no no we just um have some cooperation with some research institute we don't have to do some basic research on this field
yeah i think it's uh because uh this technology is uh
um for limited wor or limited wor uh lexical recognition it's very
it's uh yeah
it's
no it's uh
even for the f um because the the vocabulary the
the vocabulary is very small so that's not a problem
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah the key the key um the key of our the key feature of our controller is that it's it has some some um adaptation
mechanism it's it's it means when you when you sell this controller in china it's can recognise chinese it's r if you sell this controller in france it can recognise french
yeah it's
because of this product uh this technology has already been developed so
yeah
yeah
oh n yeah yeah tha that's why we have to do language adaptation
yeah
even for each f for even for different family we have to do d yeah we would we have to do adaptation to
no it's not so complex
no no no it's not
i think that's n that's not a problem because you you don't have to wear a microphone it it just the microphone is embedded in the controller
where is the controller
it's in your family in your home
yeah
yeah you can you can embed it uh microphone here
yeah yeah just you just put the controller here then you
you use your command and you do s your gesture
no no it's n y if you lose it
yeah
yeah
i think it we should give the uh flexibility to the user and we think yeah you can see they can switch form one modality to another
no that's quite inter quite attractive
well if you do language adaptation there should be no problem
we should have confidence in technology
more features yeah

yeah but if if you stick to um
stick to the first two parts so what's the difference between our controller with other products in the market there's no k features of our controller so is there is there any necessary to design new controller without any breakthrough features
would y would you replace your controller with a controller with similar function if you do not have some some function inside it that

yeah you y that's a fun that's not the function of the controller that's a function of t v  you can replace your t v  with a new t v  with internet browsing function but
okay
but it's not the only the problem only the issue of controller it's it's also the issue of the t v 
yeah but we do we do we we we cannot rely one hundred percent on these features to u to use the controller
but with the features of our controller such as you have the feature of voice recognition in your mobile
but you seldom use it your mobile but you when you choose a new mobile you choose the one
with voice recognition that's the feature is not one hundred percent reliable but it's a
feature to distinguish our product from our from other products
yeah
yeah uh
yeah if if if if you're if you ar if you already have a product it works one hundred percent reliable would you replace it with another one
yeah yeah
yeah
yeah
oh yes but there's no big difference between the traditional controller
the then nn no tha
but the there's there's n there's n not enough motivation for them to replace their old controller with a new one if there's no key feature in the new controller that's the same yeah
yeah
yeah

okay
yeah

it did didn't r receive it didn't receive it
participant one
participant one
yeah maybe we can first come to
uh to frahan with frahan then you can prepare your slides then present it later
okay

okay
okay
okay
mm hmm
okay
uh huh
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
so you got email
mm
later

pla
uh yes
yeah
yeah the smart controller
okay
mm
yeah
it's good
mm hmm
yeah
yep
yeah
yeah
okay yep
okay
okay
mm hmm
no y you do the minutes first or
no
okay
mm



mm
mm

mm
yeah but how how is how risky is it to trust like speech recognition or gesture recognition
okay okay
but this this but this would never happen anyway
yeah
yeah but the
yeah but this
yeah
i don't think it
oh okay okay you mean it could be a problem for this kind of stuff
no
no but this is disadvant disadvantage
yeah
uh if you if if you use the basic
but it's it's changing how the remote control is gonna be built because then you need uh
i mean this doesn't have uh the power to do recognition for example
yeah

yeah this could be downloaded by the web maybe or
yeah
mm
yeah but then w
yeah we have to take care of the twelve euros
problem
okay
no but then it's it's like this uh

yeah
but you would still have the buttons or is it do you think it should be only voice recognition and gesture recognition or you you still have the possibility to use buttons
okay so you yeah
yeah i dunno it's a bit risky risky
yeah i dunno
what
if if
i mean uh i'm sure if the user pays the same price he's happy to have recognition but if if if it like doubles uh
no one would would be interested
yeah
no i mean
y
no but you need you need new remote controller then because if you wanna browse internet or i don't know if you wanna type something or
no no
cause for example yeah
yeah
yeah you wou you would
true
i mean for example the goo y you say we would we would to have a google like controller
i don't see how adding speech or gesture recognition would make the remote control look more like google
google is is simple works fine so i i guess if can have a remote control that is really basic simple and works fine it's already a lot
uh thi this
i mean the user is not only interested in having speech or gesture recognition or if he has something that works fine and is really fancy looks nice and it's easy easy to use easy to use
see
that's the problem yeah i mean i i know it's more interesting to develop a remote controller with speech and gesture and whatever but you have to think the user is the one who gonna buy the product and so
i mean that's the point



hmm
yeah
dunno
i dunno if you remember what you had to say or
i think it's more interesting what he says okay

yeah true

yeah
yeah
yeah
special for
mm hmm
yeah
what about the touch scr touch screen for example it's it's expensive i i guess
mm
yeah
okay
uh no trend watching
the other one
yeah uh i think so just
yeah so just to meet the user requirements i would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market and to kind of um
have a better overview of what's the fashion in general i've checked more than only the remote control market so next
so again it's pretty much similar to what i've said in the previous meeting um user really
really want a fancy look and feel they're not so so interested in uh functional look and feel okay like
the one you've shown david with all the buttons and i mean i i it sounds good technically
but it's it's not what they want and uh
so second point is they still want it it to be technologically innovative so maybe it's sort of related to what you've said with the speech recognition and so on
at the same time it's important that it's easy to use
so that were the three first points from the remote control uh analysis now i if we look at fashion in general um
okay
wha what we really see this year is that uh everything from clothes to shoes and furniture
is is inspired by fruits and vegetables okay so i think we really have to
take this into account for the design of the the thing
'cause it's it's really what people want even if it's in general fashion we want it to be in the remote control
and then uh if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points
fancy look and feel has on a score of seven would have six as importance
uh the remote control has to be technologically innovative it's three then easy to use uh
it's not so important actually with respect to other y other ones so we see fancy look an look and
feel is the most important one and then if we combine this with the fashion uh from milan and paris
we go to the fruits and vede vegetables and the other point i haven't mention is people wan want to have a spongy touch okay so this is this maybe doesn't really fit with the wooden design
i dunno
yeah thi this is this would be like um
plastic like but rubber mayb maybe you know rubber like uh
device so um
okay tha tha that was the main point i think from the trend
in fashion
yeah so when i think it's
mm hmm

maybe not no wood but i mean ma maybe not the part you touching you know
yeah maybe the base
but still y
yeah
yeah i mean it's not exactly right for the spongy point of view
but we could maybe have both like part of wood and some rubber for the buttons or i dunno
yeah
yeah
yeah d
i dunno
what interface
yeah no not forgetting about the fruits and vegetables trends
if possible
hmm
okay
okay um
welcome to our detailed design meeting i'm pretty excited
let's start it's approximately fifteen forty or something like that
okay um the agenda we're gonna do an opening and then um i'll
talk about the minutes from the last meeting what we d discussed um then we'll have the prototype presentation and
a look at the evaluation criteria we'll look at the finances and finally a do a production evaluation
and close
so starting off with the um last the last one oh i don't have it here um but we talked about energy we're gonna
use a kinetic battery um we want to use a simple chip because we're not gonna need a a shuffle um
we're gonna need a scroll um we're choosing a latex case w in fruity colours that's curved
and um we're using push buttons uh with a supplement of an on screen menu
and it sounded like we had set um like eight or nine buttons including five pre set channels
okay let's do the look and feel design presentation first
like a little lightning in it
the little lightning bolt in it very cute
the v the rhombus rhombus
um on off
okay
yeah we turn it off
mm hmm
okay

uh huh


very interesting i think that one's my favourite
mm hmm
mm 'kay
now that was one thing that we brought up over email i don't know if you picked up your email but um the f the um feature that we considered for it not getting lost
mm hmm
it's really
would it be very difficult to um just have an external device that like i dunno you tape to your to your t v  um that when you press it you ha a little light beep goes off
do you think that would be conceptually possible
mm hmm
mm
that's true mm 'kay
mm hmm
okay that's a fair evaluation getting lost um we so we do we've decided not to worry about that for now
okay 'cause well the designs are very bright so you're right they're gonna stick out but um
mm hmm
could we maybe have like an extra button on the top for on off so then w we wouldn't have to have like a dual function
sure
um uh why don't we do a product evaluation using your criteria if you've developed some
oh okay okay
okay
do you need this or just write on the white board
okay
it's kind of like uh like a joystick kind of thing you know kinda push it
'kay
maybe a little smaller than that
oh it does it's kind of like
there it could have a stem like that 'cause i do l kind of like the stem
yeah
it almost helps you ge keep a grip too 'cause it goes in between fingers
i like this one
variety of colours are nice
i think i'm leaning towards the potato
mm hmm i am worried about like um using a menu
um in that like i withing menus there are submenus and so how do you get back to the main menu
but that has a menu button separate from a select button whereas if this one's both the menu and the select button
okay
could these be used for going to submenus or
okay
mm hmm
okay well as long as we have that in mind as we're designing it still mm 'kay
i think so
i i kind of think it's it's unique enough that i'd give it a one or a two
okay
i will give it a one
um functional
i think it'll get everything done i think it might be a little confusing at first um i don't know if that's gonna be a later one okay then i'm gonna give it a two
did you give a functional okay
well the kinetic battery
but they'll notice it after like a year they'll be like hey i have never changed the battery
mm
just the material
think i'm gonna go with the four as well
i really like that kinetic battery though
mm 'kay
uh let's say two
give it a one
mm 'cause there would be less impact maybe
that's right yeah corporate colour we didn't keep that in um well if we
i know it would make it a little less c a little more confusing but if we had all the buttons in black and a design in and the outside in yellow
that'd be our corporate one and we could also have alternative colours one a more conservative one one that's more fruity
um and can we have like an r r  inscribed on the bottom or something okay
fruity so fruity
i think i it's kind of mangoey too
yes
mm
one
mm hmm
yes
it's gonna be hard
and if it's repetitive movement it is gonna be only four buttons that you're constantly pushing but um
i like how it fits in the hand though so i i'd go with a two
mm
mm
mm hmm
i think i'd give it a four too it's a pretty high learning curve it'll be easy once you've done it but
we we i think we can kind of say we addressed it with colour but
mm hmm
mm i'd give it a four
small too
three
it's totally fashionable i'd give it a one
mango
i do like uh the little martian one
one
mm hmm i think as long if we offer in a in at least three different colour arrangements
um yeah that's good
so i'll give it a a two
well um we didn't we didn't address the fact that it does need to b have a corporate logo so let's let's make sure we keep that in mind that we ha that one of our colours concepts is corporate and has an r r  on it all of them should have r r  yeah
mm hmm mm 'kay
lovely
okay now we're gonna look at finances um i have an excel sheet that we're actually gonna calculate the cost um
so let me exit out of this first
okay um
i know
let me one more space gonna zoom in real quick

okay hand dynamo
we're using kinetic battery right
um and we're having one per
one okay um electronics
simple
mm 'kay
um the case
it's very curvy so okay
the wood
i mean the rubber
mm hmm okay
yeah we're using we're gonna need at least two special colours
um
i dunno where it yeah
so let's y say three
yeah i dunno that i thi i thought that would be under yours
we'll just say three
mm hmm maybe the r r  will be in colour as well so yeah interface we're doing push buttons and how many buttons do we have
six
anything else
oh buttons oh so um so the case material will just have one colour right but then the buttons will be in special colours
we're saying per unit
okay so each unit will only have one colour on their but the case is
could have up to thr i mean the buttons could ea could be up to three colours 'cause that how it's designed there so
special form they're all kind of just push button right
special material
uh oh do i have to do it per button do i
okay
yeah
mm hmm
thirteen point seven
yeah what can we reduce
let's see what that would do it's only gonna bring us down to thirteen point three anyway
okay um are we sure this is double curved maybe it's single curved we have no idea
well it's not the yeah okay it's the kinetic battery that's kind of expensive but we have a simple chip single curve
case material is rubber and it's a special colour but that's important six buttons we have to have six buttons
what
no okay maybe not i don't know what just happened now it's twelve
twelve point five
so we're okay i think
yeah
okay we're all set um save i saved that to our um our big shared folder so you know um okay back to agenda

um are the are the costs under twelve fifty euro yes let's move on to the project evaluation
project process
satisfaction with for example the room for creativity leadership teamwork the means any new ideas
found so i guess what we're gonna talk about here is just evaluating how we created this project the information
we got on the news how we used it if we were able to um you know use our creativity with the information
um how how well i guess i led it um the how well
we worked together as a team um the digital pens the whiteboard
okay
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm

mm hmm
i think we all made um very significant contributions i don't think anybody dominated it which i thought was really good like each of us was able to um like each of you had your information and i uh i tried to facilitate it without like taking over um
i like our little finished products
really cute
i know let's think of it like a little jingle
um
okay um new ideas found
definitely or or at least be c p creative enough to think of toggle switches mm
etcetera
oh i'm so excited
mm hmm
i thi yeah that's awesome
um okay closing
are the costs within the budget is the project evaluated now there's the final questionnaire and meeting summary
um so this is the great product kids i think we've created something really interesting and that we have a market
for it um especially if we can produce it at twelve point three which we hope um
yeah make sure in your questionnaire to put down criticisms of
both the process and the um the final results and i do like the martian remote if we could choose more than one that would be my second choice
although the tog toggle
i'm afraid i would
it's cool i think i would break it
oh yeah it's kind of a penguin
mm mm

mm 'kay congratulations
um
anything else to say
alright
um anybody have i got more master classes anybody else wanna like take a master's class
yeah but check it out so like there are all these like links they don't go anywhere
but all that you need to keep in mind your knowledge management um just wanna make sure you do
oh
it is
yes definitely i'm very sad that i didn't get any links to the corporate website
wow
yes i love excel it's one of my favourite programs
i see mm
spongy
i i thought it was a little tricky having to hand around this thing
we had a lot of the um otherwise the technology today was kinda cool
mm hmm
no although i don't see how we could have very l at least for me i
mm
mm hmm
and with and with the powerpoint that we can all look at like you can do all those things pretty much on powerpoint as that's not as necessary to have
mm
mm hmm
mm hmm
now when you were um creating your um prototypes here did you work together or did you like do separate projects
mm hmm
mm hmm
cool
oh thanks
it's kinda fun
mm
mm hmm
mm hmm
this is what we'll do
i found that we did we could have used another five or ten minutes
sometimes in the meetings
mm hmm yeah i think the last time we had a lot of information but at the same time not quite enough you know what i mean like we we couldn't answer every single question
um but
mm
it was interesting what came out like later like as i was doing the when i was doing the breakdown on the agenda that they gave me um that more points came out from your presentation even
um
i'm a little i am a little disappointed that we didn't do a um something for losing the remote because that was kind of a big point
about yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
considered the re yeah
well it's interesting that they
mm hmm yeah it was interesting though that they put that fifty percent of people say they have frustration with losing their remote and yet they didn't provide us with information to um we weren't provided with information to discuss that
i know that like people people have like things they can put on their keys that you press it and it'll beep but i but i'm sure that would require some kind of technology that
i just don't know what it is but
mm
hmm
mm hmm
mm
it d yeah it depends on how organised you are personally but
mm hmm


oh
can't get in

yep
we should make one that walks by itself
or or like some crazy like electro magnet that you push it and it'll go zoom to the t v  and stick there

well but if you could attach them to the t v  then you can
mm
okay
sorry i'm just um trying to update my minutes i decided to you know how i sent you the email saying that powerpoint
minutes will be complimentary rather than like repeating them just gonna make i'm making full minutes so that it'll include all
of the agenda and all that 'cause that seems a little more useful
but i didn't have like information to sloth through either so
most of it mm hmm i added slides um i added a couple slides each time but that was about it
mm
well the thing was they would provide y an agenda with s like several points but it wouldn't have a slide for each point and that's the only way i remember
that i need to go other that point i know personally when i do powerpoint that's what i do and so i had it once
even if it was just like the title of it like the three presentations and i would do your three
the slogan on it no no no
i think we just need the um the r r  yeah
yeah i was just kinda going by the web page 'cause they didn't give me any clear like yellow grey or
i don't really like yellow in general
but it
wasn't it interesting that um i thought it was interesting that our market marketing um expert did not agree with the marketing um
the marketing choices you know like that was a bit of a conflict

people are stupid
maybe like i don't know that could always be
oh
i'm claiming it intellectual property
right well we made three different prototypes and i guess we'll start with with this one
um we have our colours not are not fixed but this is the general shape
um it's you hold it sort of either like like this in your left hand or you switch it over and
uh it's easily adaptable to either hand you can push the buttons with your thumb like a mobile phone or you can push them with your
index finger of your other hand or even i mean there's a whole variety you can hold it like this and press it with your same index finger
uh we have the on off button at the tip very visible very big
we have our up and down buttons which are also gonna be our channel selectors and we have our little menu button
here if you push if you're just pushing these normally they're the menu buttons if uh the
volume buttons rather if you press select once they become channel changing buttons if we press select three times
the menu with the other features and pro possibly also with your t v  channel choices
shows up and you have your five presets down here
um if people wanna grab hold of that see how it feels in your hand
that's our number one prototype um do you wanna present the potato or shall i present the martian
that's the rhombus yep


if you pressed and held it maybe
yeah
on off that's a possibility yeah
and then finally we have um the martian or the pear either way um
it's a bit different just a little bit more of a creative feel uh you have the on off toggle stem
on the top we have the five preset seeds
and then you have on the sides to make it a little bit more three dimensional you have your channel changing volume changing buttons and your menu button right here in the middle
so that's for your consideration as well plus it's an interesting talking point to have standing up we figured it could stand up like this on your table if you wanted it to if i made the bot the bottom flat
uh the menu select button

we were we were thinking that
normally we'd go for fruity colours but maybe we're also thinking that your sort of middle aged
man for an example customer might not want a fruity coloured remote so m
maybe we'd have one version that's a bit toned down maybe with with less contrasts on it
yeah something still a little bright to make it hard to lose but
yeah
right well we were we were talking about that a little bit when we got that email and we think
that each of these are so distinctive that it it's not just like another piece of technology around your house it's gonna be somewhere that
it can be seen so we're we're not thinking that it's gonna be as critical to have the loss
i think
yeah
there might be something that you can do in the circuit board and the chip
to make it make a noise or something but it would take a lot more development than we have this afternoon
so d do people have a preference as far as feel and functionality um
mm yeah that's good that's good
here stick it on

so where

right
okay
ooh

hey

no i kinda like it that's hard to miss


like

yeah interesting
okay is that where people are leaning then the potato i like the idea of the i mean that's really gotten the simplicity of the buttons down that one
hmm
well that on the ipod for example you just every time you wanna go back you hit the menu button again and it brings you back one level
good point
maybe yeah maybe it can be one of those if you press down and hold
for two seconds then it brings you back one level or something
the potato are we leaning towards the potato
okay
okay
okay
yeah
um i dunno if it's it's creative i dunno if fancy is the word i would use
i dunno if any of them are fancy in i'd say two because c unique
yeah one
in the battery that's it
how many people would notice that though
yeah i i would say that it's
yeah like fancy versus creative it's it's
different but does that equal innovative i dunno i'll give it a three
okay
um i'll give it a one pretty hard to mess up


yeah
ooh that you couldn't it'd be harder to break harder to lose
mm

it it might be 'cause that's our corporate colour isn't it
we might wanna keep it yellow
yeah
if we had a yellow
sure
so it was inspired by the potato so i think it's pretty fruity
oh mango that that
that's a much more trendy than a potato one

yeah me too
yeah
yeah
i'll i'll say two as well because older people that aren't used to like texting with the thumb might find it a bit at first but
the menu system and the the fact that multiple buttons are used for different things might be a bit confusing but i think if it's one it's one of those things that it might take you five minutes to figure out but you'll have it afterwards so i'd i think i'd give it a two i guess
oh good point


um i'd say i'd give it uh a three i guess it depends on how tidy you are normally
simple to use or simple in design do you know

right
i'm give it a three i guess

i dunno i don't think it's quite as fashionable as my robot remote
or alien or whatever he was

um two
yeah
yeah i'll say two
shall we uh
well i think all of them should have an r r 
oh my
uh we're n using kinetic yeah
yeah
single simple simple rather
uh uh uh double curved
yeah i never did get a picture of those so i don't really know
our case material supplements oops we just skipped by them no we we the plastic is the plastic for the inside is assumed the supplement is
oh i guess it was rubber rather than latex
yeah
uh well
i don't know what the se the basic colour is though
well are we talking about on each colour combination or are we you know we'll like we'll have yellow and black is that two special colours
or or is white and black then two more or
uh
i guess it's three three three
alright
yeah
six with the power
yeah
no oh we'll do we wa
are the buttons in special colour special f
i didn't get information on
well does it but if we're making multiple varieties of this is where i'm getting confused
per unit okay okay
alright and each button s
yeah okay
no i think they're fine material we want them rubber as well probably yeah
no i don't think so
i think they're if they're all gonna be rubber then it that's what it matters
yeah
yeah
okay
oh oh
okay let's have our buttons all be one colour
alright
uh
we have no idea
i dunno i didn't get any pictures
it's single curved why not
yeah
that is important how did it get more expensive what did you just change it was it was thirteen and now it's fifteen

twelve point five hey hey
we're all set then
ish
alright
yes
well
i felt very creative i enjoyed making the prototypes
yeah
i think we could've done even better with a little bit more information like what's a single curved case how many colours what do colours count
things but given given what we had i think that we did we did really well
um i think we worked together pretty well
yeah but the fruits and vegetables they really my creativity so
do you think we could
yeah
yeah
can we market this as the mango remote should we have that somewhere on the packaging
i have a little r r 


yes hopefully not with just my fingernail at some point but um it's quite a useful little gadget
all thanks to iain for the design of that one
mm what did we find for new ideas people should really base their remotes on fruits and vegetables
i i am really into the idea of kinetic batteries now after reading about them that was
i i knew you can get watches that had them like really quite expensive watches that just never need a battery 'cause you're always moving your wrist
but in other things i think it'd be really good
yes
yeah



it started because i wanted to have it as st as a stem and then alright so

is it started as a pear but then it started looking more and more like a martian when i put the
take me to your leader

wow maybe i should market it to some remote control company now
so are are poor little thing
oh
it's really funny that you got spam in your work emails






let's see what did i get through the corporate website it's just inspiration about circuit boards
yeah that is pretty neat
yeah my inspiration from from last time is the in interior of a remote control being taken apart bit by bit talking about circuit boards i learned a lot actually i could probably take apart a remote control now if i really needed to
now i have all about circuits and chips and transponders and i wrote it all down because i thought it would be relevant like all the different parts of the inside of a remote control but then they're like you don't actually need this you just need to talk about the case
it's really interesting though
yeah
that was really neat how i got emails and
no
i yeah if i'd gotten pictures of the different parts of the case the different looks of the case i would have probably drawn them up but
yeah we could've put our brainstorming stuff up there rather than just talking about it but with only four people it doesn't really make sense i think if you had a larger group
yeah
because we're all gonna be working in different places we if we were all gonna stay in here all the time then having the notes up on the whiteboard would've been alright but everyone needs their own like specific notes i guess
yeah
yeah
so it was a bit of both really we just kind of started out by each taking a colour of clay and
just fooling around with it and i came up with that rhombus shape and he came up with the sort of potatoey mangoey shape and then just went from there really
it was fun

so well done with the management i felt well managed
that happened to me all the time though
yeah i was quite worried at the end of the last meeting that we weren't getting we didn't really have enough information to make firm decisions but we were able to do it regardless so
i'm not usually a very decisive person so it helped to have people say this needs to be done in five minutes
especially last time yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
right
and i i felt the first two meetings that i was coming in with no information and not sort of
made me really like ooh i don't know throwing together powerpoint out of no no information and then last time it was like the opposite i had so much information and so much to talk about
yeah
mm
yeah
that was something like in order to talk about that we would've had to have actual knowledge about circuit boards and things like
yeah
i think we were
yeah
i think we were just getting overenthusiastic with the task i think we really got into it i mean i got into it as the day went on and i got really like ooh i'm designing a remote control i dunno if that's just me but
yeah
yeah
i think there are some of those like infomercial remotes that have things
so you won't lose them
i dunno i mean we were talking about it and like i in my household at least there's only about two places that the remote is ever 'cause there's only one t v  and
there's only like three chairs
yeah
yeah or like i guess what the setup of the house is too
but i mean
i am notorious for losing my keys i just i guess i've just never lost the remote i put my keys in the refrigerator the other night and couldn't find them 'cause i was putting groceries away
you you're taking stuff from a bag and putting them in the refrigerator and then go back to my room
can't get in look all around the kitchen
definitely in the vegetable drawer
so
mm
but i guess it's 'cause we don't carry remotes around that much
yeah
maybe with our little robot one we could've had him have a robot alien pear whatever he is have a little voice like i am located
oh a g p s  system internal g p s 
although if it's sitting still for too long
yes i
or little
or just just a wheel you know
just if you like you'd have a remote for your remote that'll

zoom
yeah
hmm
all kinds of possibilities
yeah
oh
wow
'cause you've had like the most typing and organising to do
yeah i guess
how much of your powerpoint was already done for you every meeting
oh
okay
yeah i didn't even think about adding slides 'cause i would just get slides with titles on them and fill them all in w didn't even think about adding more
ah yeah 
right
no no definitely not
we
no i don't think we need to i think the r  and r  especially if the yellow and black one
or yellow and blue lemme go to the web page
finish meeting now



yeah
i guess it i it sort of a grey isn't it yellow and grey but then the slogan's in blue
yeah well we don't have the right colour clay anyway
well we're not sadly going to actually be producing this so
potato mango shaped remotes

i can't believe a whole day is gone i don't feel like it's been that long
get sucked in
mm i haven't gotten questionnaire eight yet
right do you wanna start
okay um
what
we call that one the rhombus uh the rhombus um this one is known as the potato uh it's
it's a how can i present it it's an ergonomic shape so it it fits in your hand nicely um
it's designed to be used either in your left hand or or in your right hand
um i've gone here just for just for four buttons on this one um
the two blue buttons here are for adjusting the volume so you've got volume up and volume down on the other side here
um the red ones are for uh changing channels channel up and channel down and that's um moves between your favourite channels that you've selected
uh this middle button here brings up the on screen menu and when you're working in the on screen menu you use the other four buttons to navigate around the menu system and the middle button uh to select
and that's basically it that's the potato
uh that would be one of your channels basically so like channel zero would be t to switch switch the machine off yeah
um not really it would make it hard to turn the machine off to turn your t v  off
yeah yeah that that'd be one way of doing it yeah that'd work yeah
let's pass
so that's
so that's our three prototypes um basically in terms of making decisions what we'd need to do is first of all decide on a form uh which of the three different shapes we want then decide what kind of button layout we want how many buttons
and then to choose what colours we want to make the buttons and if we wanna put any text on the device like label on the buttons or put a brand name or or a logo on it or whatever
would
yeah
but we don't want it to look like a kids' toy
yeah
i think it would be difficult technologically because if your if your remote's lost it's probably under the settee and in that case you can't you can't send an infrared sing signal to it to find it s so it's
i'm not quite sure how it would work and then i wonder if it's if it's more just a gimmick then anything else
uh i mean ho how many times do you really seriously lose your remote control and would
would a device like that actually help you to find it
yeah it's possible yeah yeah
put an extra the button on
cool

it makes look more fruity as well
it's like a deformed foot i dunno

yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
this is it's the up and down buttons are used for scrolling up and down for a list of choices you find the choice that you want and you press uh you press the right button uh
yeah
yeah so they're used for going into and out of your submenus yeah
potato
i'll go for two
i think it's it's functional it's also pretty basic so i'll give it a two
i'd say it's technologically it's not it's not unique i mean it's it's just it is just pushbuttons um so i i'd give it a four
i'll say one

i wonder if it bounces when you drop it

yeah
yeah i'd i'd give it a one
uh um
yeah

yeah
yeah
mangoey is better yeah i like mangoes
uh two
uh one
yeah yeah
yeah i'll i'll say two
i think it it's probably a little harder then most remotes to learn because you have to you have to use the menu system and you have to tell it what your favourite channels are and that could take a bit of learning at first but
once you've yeah once you'd learned how to use it i think it is a lot easier so i'd i'd give it a four
yeah
yeah
um i'll give it a five 'cause i it would be easy to lose something like that yeah
i'll give it a two



three
guess it's double curved it is pretty curvy
special colours isn't it
we've got five oh six
yeah
yeah
what was our target price again
twelve point five so we're just just about there
yeah

i think we've been successful in that we've achieved almost all of the design goals that we've set and we've come up with a finished project and we just about got cost
yeah


yeah


yeah


mm
that's cool let's all let's all go for the yellow
break the stem off


that was bound to happen 


mm
yeah
i think
yeah
we didn't we didn't use the whiteboard that much

yeah
uh we we worked together um but we were making like we sort of made different shapes and then discussed how the how the buttons might work um and how we could like improve on the on the design
i think we did well in first of all giving our meetings the time and second we actually
we we did a good job of making firm decisions at the ends of the meetings
and i
i know what happens sometimes is that you tend to sort of have meetings and then people sorta drift away without anything actually
really being decided but i think here we got we got clear and and decisive decisive points
at the end of the meetings so that we we knew where to go on from there
yeah
yeah for some of the meetings yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah




yeah


i could

could the middle button of the on screen menu function as a power button
if you like held it down that would be on off
sorry what's the yellow one in the middle i forgot

but if it's like under covers or like in a couch you still can't see it
i feel like this is simil or it's sort of what already exists so if we're trying to think of something sort of like
new and fun even though this is like what you're init i'm initially drawn to just 'cause it's like comfortable
and like not different i sort of like this one like i i don't know why it just it's like
small but still sort of like cute looking i dunno but i also like the b
the side buttons on that one like i think that's kind of neat
but i dunno how much any of this has to do with the fashionable sort of cool looking thing that we also need to focus on
ah there we go

well do we w like i think we're supposed to have one that we do it for
that was i was a little vague on what exactly i'm supposed to do but let me i have to like write something on the whiteboard so
no i actually don't have like a powerpointy thing 'cause i think it would be redundant
i dunno

okay so which one are we sort of roughly looking at to address whether or not it meets our s um necessities the yellowy one is that
okay well we can obviously change it after we go through each different one so basically what we need to do is some of the things that we've talked
about before we need to make sure that that remote actually does conform to the things that we said it
was going to so what we sort of wanna do is that we each need to separately
rank each of the following things and then i'll tabulate an average just to make sure that
it does meet that so we'll just go through them one at a time and we'll just go around and each of you can tell me on a scale of one to seven
with one being really extremely true
and seven being not true at all or false if the remote that we've created conforms
to the following criteria so we can do this one first first we wanna know if it meets the fancy
look and feel um objective
so like in my opinion the for now at least the yellow one is probably somewhere in the middle so i'm gonna say it's like a three that's just my opinion
what does each of you
okay well give it a number sorry
okay
and two awesome alright and same sort of scale for functionality is it functional i think it's extremely functional i'm gonna give it a one
one
okay
okay well there's some other ones i will address that yeah
awesome okay um we wanna know next if it's technologically innovative
yeah she said it was one um is it technologically innovative
mm
not really i mean not so much 'cause we we don't have the l c d  screen we don't have fancy chip other than what it looks like i dunno if it's really
i kinetic battery is a big one so
mm
but it but we know it's there
and if it's made of like latex that whole idea that's pretty cool i'll give it a three
'cause it we could've picked a lot of features that would've made it really
alright
everyone else
mm 'kay
next is it easy to use just so you know easy to learn will be separate so don't overlap them i think it's really easy to use i'll give it a two
alright um we next wanna see if it has a spongy quality and if indeed it's made of latex or rubber i it's spongy all the way
yeah
mm hmm
iain what do you give it
alright and the next is does it integrate some notion of fruits and vegetables well is it gonna be yellow
yeah but if you had like a silvery kind of white or something
oh yeah
alright so i think it it's
yeah

yeah i okay i'm giving it a one the mango put me over
what are what's everyone's numbers
alright um and does the design match the appropriate behaviour remember earlier we discussed that people don't use a lot of buttons that they use the channel flipping and the volume the most
i think we really took that into account a lot so i'm gonna give it a one
did you say one rose
okay um also we talked earlier about r s i  and wanting to prevent um any sort of like carpal tunnely kind of thing do we think that the latex sort of grip appropriately takes that into account
i think i'll give it a two 'cause i almost feel like no matter what you do something is gonna happen
um um worth the risk i think
'kay
alright awesome and the ease of learning it i know you were saying that you're a little bit nervous about that
i dunno it sort of reminds me of the ipod i just got mine i still haven't read the instruction book and i'm doing okay so
and i'm not good at learning technology so i'll give it a two
mm hmm
okay
mm hmm
alright um also earlier we had something about losing it and so now we're not addressing that at all so
okay so in terms of not losing it do you think that on a scale of one to seven how easy or
hard is it to lose i'm gonna i'm gonna give it a four 'cause i think that you can
still if it's in between somewhere where you can't see it you're kind of not gonna find it but anywhere else it's gonna stand out
alright we also said simplicity how w how well does it address just being simple
i think overall 'cause we had said before our two main things were simplicity and fashion so those are the next two things we're gonna look at separate from fancy like that sort of thing
um it like wants to be simple but it's not like totally totally simple so i'm gonna give it a two
alright and fashionable
it's hot i mean it's a mango come on
i mean how fashionable can you make a remote i think it's bringing technology and fashion together real really well
yeah the toggle on off switch it's really appealing

number
and does it meet our like demographic need sort of for international appeal
that whole thing
just that it would se serve our audience
i don't see why not
mm hmm
alright did anyone have any other features that they think were important that we didn't talk about
and so we're gonna do that so it will address it fine
okay
that's me
whoa
simple
yeah
well don't we need plastic and
provided okay
it was rubber and special colour right
do we have more than one special colour
per
well but we know that we're having at least three colours so
right
we have six
oh no five

oh wait
yeah
yeah per unit
yeah
i like it like that
yeah 'cause it wouldn't make sense otherwise 'cause for the whole mat case material it's only one it's i mean it's two to make it rubber oh wait so maybe

mm i kind of like the buttons
it's single curved

we

yeah they are

yeah i mean if i'd had more market research on the fruits and vegetables maybe we could've taken that into account
i know i really did the the whole mango idea was great no i mean
i thought the pen was a little distracting for me personally like its heaviness and
like just being so conscious of like turning the pages i dunno that was a bit of a distraction that
was the last one like i chose not to do a powerpoint 'cause i didn't think it made sense to so i liked that i had the option to do that
and just to take my own notes and that whole sort of thing

they're funny
i kind of want one
i'm trying to think of a good pun that i could add there

i like the r r  that's gonna be etched in
yeah i didn't even know they existed
yeah real reaction
oh that would definitely be my second choice

i would break it i would break it
oh that's funny
kind of looks like a penguin like with no eye
i like that it stands up
oh sad
nothing will come up until after our meeting's supposed to be over its all timed
oh



no the first one that you sent like i didn't realise that it was a joke and i was like why did she send this to us it's very it's very work relevant 'cause people send spam a lot
oh here you can you can view
you can just see what's up
yeah it's it's really deep hold on
takes a little while to get excited to load that the excel thing is pretty cool here like basically it's like inspiration basically i'm gonna give you two sentences on fashion and
that kind of thing see you didn't miss out that much
oh wow
this one was cooler i got a whole table and everything
that's like mine it was like would you prefer an l c d  screen or a multifunction remote control and then it didn't have like any kind of table like awesome i'm glad they asked that question and didn't report the result
yeah
'cause we weren't like voting on anything and i think usually like whiteboards are good you know like crossing out ideas or like if we had had like a brainstorming period
but i thought we were good orally
get crazy
and these might've made us more willing to like take notes than to
like write up them here 'cause we all needed them separately kind of on the whiteboards in this room

yeah
sorry
well the problem was even when we just were creating from the excel file there wasn't like a option to select to somehow have it included so there was no we could be like yeah it has it included there was no way for us to have
written down that it was really there

yeah
that's like saying you're never gonna lose your keys and i always do anyway
you'll lose 'em in your pocket like you just will forget that or you like put it down somewhere that like made sense and then not remember there's always ways to lose things
that's funny
that's funny
i always do that leaving it in my coat and then like using a different coat
yeah
can't really take it into the other room


oh man
here you go
that really could get up and walk away
you have you have to have the slogan on it or can it just be like
okay good
'cause i was like it could go around the outside
is it yellow and blue
oh i guess it is black grey grey is better than black doesn't look so bumblebeeish
hey now i understand the random like newsclippings

yes
i will i just feel like if you're really doing like a a really big market evaluation you wouldn't just have like one set of source it's kind of an they were so not backed up it would just be a sentence like we did a survey this is what people said
s mm i dunno
well we got some grey and we got some blue buttons we're good
if they ever come out with potato
i'm gonna have to
yeah
i know
mm
so uh now it's the hi sammy
it's the detail design meeting so we're going last meeting
so um first uh mark and rama are going to present uh
the prototype uh then uh sammy will propose some uh crite
cr criteria to evaluate this prototype then w we
and then we going to do some finance to see if uh it is uh feasible
and uh at the end we will we will um evaluate ourself as a team
and that's all okay so first let's uh
see the prototype

okay and you have some slides then yeah mm
okay uh so in which uh
mm okay mm



mm hmm

masa





okay


what do you say

one day he



hmm

mm hmm

mm hmm


bobby mm hmm
hmm 'kay

are colourful yeah

ho ho
that's for the l c d  or for the titanium
mm mm

hey you know you're theme today
hmm

and w wait wh what are the strawberries for
wh wh
mm hmm
okay strawberries
ah

okay mm hmm
uh we'll see in the financial part if uh all gets into

w
who is the five uh fifty millions we first make a party in

mm hmm okay uh so
let's uh yeah let's see if uh th it's meet the evaluation criterium
oops

okay
mm hmm
uh i think that fancy we can say it is fancy
oh i am not the d the only one choosing yeah uh what do you think

uh huh
yeah yeah
it's in the other yeah
mm

two let's say two yeah
change colour of t
yeah i think it's a
yeah yeah
mm mm

um
the strawberries oh

mm mm
yeah but it's too it's um robust yeah
oh yeah lets me try
yeah
what is uh next please
and you can uh do di two sites yeah
okay also
you can by using the
you c push here the the yeah

let me understand well because i'm not sure that's for that this one are b d uh two dir directional button yeah two
yeah
yeah and which what is that
okay okay it's a kind oh okay okay
oh oh okay great
now it's looks us useful yeah
yeah
mm mm

mm hmm


mm mm

uh oh

yeah
yeah
yeah it's
let's imagine
and what about the strawberries on the top i'm not convince but maybe i'm not trendy but uh
yeah but uh uh they're not useful i i mean it that's uh
mm hmm
yep
hmm
i would have m uh i found more fancy that the fruits are useful
yeah
mm hmm but the n yeah
mm
no i'm not sure uh why uh if it was like this
i
it's n no it's not fancy any more
okay
uh huh and different routes okay i see what
okay so you you you feel like it's something uh a protection for the remote control
also
okay
okay
okay

wow that's a

yea
yeah it's fudge titanium you know right yeah and uh
okay let's go for one
yeah
so it's a good evaluation
yeah mm
mm mm
okay so now it has to fulfil the financial criterium
so i have an here um
 

okay so two
uh huh
oh
yeah yeah but the price is two oh number sorry sorry sorry i'm sorry
yeah yeah oh
no never
h


okay
and for the

one also

i thought you can curve somebody
mm hmm oh see i i think that the the price is this one
yeah yeah don't chip on me
mm hmm
mm mm
yeah but she wanted u the fudge titanium i think it's five but you don't say
mm
oh sorry again i'm see it
special colour or it's only on the
yeah but there is no colour here so i put it here
how many push button three or two
is there the scroll wheel okay
okay
um
that's that's not we choose this one and not this one
or only a scroll wheel
you try to s no no no because how do you do to y select
yeah i mean you you go on the location with your scroll wheel and then you
stay longer okay oops okay okay um
mm hmm
you you have all of these no
mm maybe n not this one but
yeah so
not special colours an interest in
and buttons are not colourised
they are m
boo hoo it's already too expensive apparently
yeah mm
mm hmm mm

so think of what we can cut uh here

apparently we have to choose one or the other

but you don't need a battery mm
but um it's like the hand dynamo no
uh it's a it's a beginning okay
so
one here and here
'kay
mm hmm
mm that's right
m maybe minus uh three no
mm hmm mm
so oh sorry mm hmm
mm
okay

oh we can put uh a hand dynamo and a battery if you want oh both its it's cool
mm
yeah yeah y
yeah mm it's maximum and don't have to yeah yeah uh
uh mm mm
yeah mm okay mm so target reached
it's um english uh yeah
yeah but uh is uh english so mm



mm let's try okay
i save it uh
okay so next mm

no that's yours sorry
'kay

okay so now

we have to make um
yeah yeah mm see mm how are we a good team mm

mm hmm
mm
is there enough room for creativity
mm and you
mm oh okay well project evaluation

so you say is there sheep
luck okay so luck but good which imply good uh team performance


mm hmm


okay mm

okay
a lot of uh

yeah uh new ways of doing financial
mm
mm they're working on um pink titanium


mm yeah yeah we're really nice yeah mm okay i think it's
yeah uh how yeah mm
i'm the one proposing the celebration of course you know i'm the program manager
mm hmm ah um i think it's finish
yeah mm
mm mm and we go to the party

thank you to you mm

yes
and chocolate


mm hmm
yes and place some slides
uh participant three
prototype
uh so
this is our
remote control

it's a r working prototype you can use it now by switching all these buttons so first
i present as we came to this perfect model and then we'll give some technical specifications
that's well so that's that please next slide
we analysed all the fruits and contacted nasa and uh made some
real good yeah if you can see this and the stars are showing that
and um

s society will accept that for sure
and making some analysis of different fruits we choose the ultimate form ultimate colours and uh ultimate smell of it s please next slide
but we still didn't want to go far from our titanium idea 'cause it's the most of the moder the m
the modern material we can p select
and it's practical
and it's still say it's for our needs so please press something
and as i said it's perfect
please press it everyone is f really uh really glad to obtain an

s such a r such a device so you can touch it with your hands sure yes
n
you must say it
yeah

okay y and we got the answer uh it is yes of course please next slide um this is a prototype you can have a look at it and
that's all i wanted to say now it's technical specification by our
colleague







we are still working on titanium so r we'll start with l c d  you can ask bob it's tuesday


that's location sensors


yeah and we can just some strawberry first um
oops


let's make a party first maybe

feel the weight
really
okay
two two
yeah yeah yeah
yeah uh

no no how can i say this it's still it's still working and your daughter got a bonus a strawberry
you can
you go you so the basic mode yeah so that's simple the basic mode is uh you
got just two buttons and a jog dial with two buttons you do this like uh volume up
volume down or if you go to the site it's channel up channel down and if you want
to make to s twenty five you push on this
you select twenty you select five that's it
no
yeah yeah
it's a jog dial for controlling the cursor on the l c d  screen like selecting the menus

sure without titanium alloy it's going to be light
of course
okay okay

and
moreover moreover it covers it covers all the end goals even if it is you know it's very rounded but still you got some rubber fruit here and it's completely uh completely secure to leave it uh with children and that

okay okay
sure sure just look at it
it's full adaptable
yeah you can fit it into your palm you know
mm


it's two point one seven
no uh you just number yeah
how what what's the limit
uh it's it's okay that i don't know 'cause uh it's not my field twelve bucks okay now mm hmm check that number also
it's it's flat
it's flat
but it is flat you look it's curvable but it's not curved

oh okay
mm
mm
well n why three why three


for buttons
no buttons just normal
that's for buttons but buttons are standard

well as you may know there's some research done in the field of producing energy from mechanical eng i mean producing electricity from mechanical energy
so the point is that when you take device and push the button you produce enough energy
to make electricity yeah that you don't need a battery so it's something like hand dynamo robot
a real high tech version of it
okay but l
why not let's do that
and i propose to so uh about chips advanced chip on print right so put minus one there please
why not
and
so was there result let's have a look
why
oops
yeah why not
minus
good

and a battery and a battery yeah
now it's fancy let's add one instead of two
well i don't know i don't know
i am not sure who was programming this calculator you know
'cause uh
i wonder if we put a  or b  somewhere instead of a number
next slide
okay
yeah yeah
yeah
m maybe not huh
what was the oh yeah what was good everything what was bad

yeah a good leader you know a good leader is somewhere in the shade and

of course uh
not to waste time that's important
we need time f

new materials
budget
alright

okay
yeah it is
so we see we can even forecast
they propose us like celebration everything we could forecast it right
you
it was you
okay
okay




yeah
uh here we have our prototype model
yeah yeah we have also some slides
in
yeah
five
him




experience explanat
see this
you can
spongy


hmm

so
yeah this this is really flexible you can add your buttons yeah so function mm
so as we discussed we have to switch on switch off whenever we want and
so we have buttons and using l c d  or like you can use this jog wheel and
select which ever option on the l c d  and then do on and off then you ha you'll have
volume control so you you can press these buttons to increase or decrease
the volume
and we have some l c d  controls like m switching the l c d  display if you want to use l c d  or
you don't want you can just use normal button and we have speech recognition here
you have microphone and then it date records your voice and then it try to recognise and it
can also do the action
and location finder and we want to do the location basically using speech recogniser you can
just say where is my remote control or uh you can just give some nickname to your remote control like
bobby and then it will say hi
yeah hi and then you can use it
so um our team is now fruits mainly strawberry so you can have and then you can see the look l c d  and all the switches
material we want to stick to titanium

we will send we want to
yeah or s
so we want to have simple and perfect shapes like i shown in these phones
you can have your own designs and and you can feel simple designs
and you can choose colours on your day for each day or even many
colours
for the l c d 
with titanium it's it is silver yeah
mm yeah
yeah

yeah even you can configure your colours for its the depending on your mood or s
and you can have many colours on weekends or
huh
ah these are like sensors

so after this meeting we'll propose a party for our success for
so if you are vegetarian or you have any options please let us know
yeah

s
so any specific questions for

yeah

yeah then we can discuss we can

yeah then we can have how much for how money is left

yeah

fudge
yeah
fancy
huh
yeah what's is really
uh it's really

yeah oh
yeah yeah we can give at least five or six seven
oh oh so oh okay
yeah okay oh okay so
m maybe two
technology
yeah um
and we have l c d 
so you change colours
useful

yeah yeah it's silly
uh still we need to cha
yeah it maybe strawberry
oh
yeah we can easily plug it

yeah yeah
yeah
useful
yeah
yeah
yeah channel i this is volume control and channel changes these are the main
you
yeah yeah and you can do on l c d  using these going to scrolling all the option so if you don't want
yeah um yeah
yeah
and channel
you can select
yeah mm
yeah yeah yeah y you need to like press two and five and yeah
yeah yeah yeah mm
so d yeah we need to address we want we only address two main functions here and the other functions will be on l c d  so
so
yeah
yeah up
this is jog wheel

yeah
um see in l c d  like you will have blocks and you select which one
yeah
yeah
two maybe
yeah yeah
yeah it's size al almost
yeah because it is the weight will be bit lighter we will s we use titanium yeah
yeah yeah
heavy yeah
yeah
but sides uh the sides should be okay yeah mm
oh
yeah
the case is silver titanium no
yeah
oh
yeah yeah yeah
so maybe i think
yeah
yeah well
yeah um
yeah well then it's bit difficult to use not like this d we're just giving the fruit for more fanciness and more
attraction too so maybe think we can have rubber or some sponges stuff for strawberries
and different colours so it's even
these buttons
but it looks really not really good i mean the f yeah so these are kind of rubber things even if you lose one you can just put whatever even we can provide many different colours or different fruits and
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah yeah yeah we've yeah we have sensors here and so here and here so we just yeah so even if you don't put it works but this is really fancy
yeah
yeah
yeah

yeah you can yeah

yeah
yeah
three three six eight eleven
hmm
yeah mm yeah two one one seven we have so
financi



energy uh we use bat
one battery yep
oh we just need one i guess
no number is one we need only one battery
number number



so we

we have sample chip uh like simple chip yeah so yeah yeah four buttons at least and then we have the t sample speaker sensor for speech recognition
yeah one to one yeah one
yeah i think we will go for a single curve no
oh is
oh oh okay


yeah
oh
titanium

yeah well

no only one no
um
interface
yes in l c d  display ok
yeah an yeah
push button
scro
uh two
yeah
one scroll wheel one l c d 
displayed
yeah
yeah it's cheaper
yeah
only scroll wheel yeah mm
so
it's already
ah
y ye
yeah then it automatically we can just do like you feel it goes and it will activate um plus yeah it's price is really
special colours yeah
okay
yeah buttons and strawberries yeah
special form


uh we have titan
yeah

mm hmm i think uh because you can just go for a good colours yeah and uh

yeah
oh



sample speaker yeah
yeah
maybe the jog wheel can be like kind of hand
is
yeah
yeah
yeah just remo
s
yeah


uh no
yeah
no no it's not
it's not changing no it you don't


so now on we can increase our still you have two more maybe we can use it for our party
yeah
yeah yeah
yeah that

no but point five point three
okay
is really strict oh
oh yeah
ho
oh uh


and we can discuss all these things in our party
mm yeah very much
yeah yeah

yeah it's really
yeah
yeah our team work is really strong
oh we still i guess
hmm

don't really
yeah
and we also

mm we made mm

hmm
ah we got new idea speech recognition location finding
new materials new s uh this fancy strawberry design
and new tricks
ah very
yeah



yeah
yeah yeah it's we got two good score
oh okay
so where we will go now
uh ye will go to italian restaurant or
ah okay we can decide yeah
yeah thank you
so hi christa

yes
mm
yeah

mm hmm







such a nice thing
can i ho ho
imitating flatulence 
it says
i will uh
i'll buy it if i if i need so hopefully my daughter will like it
yes of course of c course

ah

oh there is a button missing okay it's in option
hmm

mm hmm
hey babe bob hey bob
okay that's good


oh these are strawberries


fruit smelling spongy titanium i didn't know it exist but that's great

ha
you mean we can change the colour uh of th
yeah yeah okay for the l c d 
tit titanium is
uh okay
yeah bob please tuesday colour
okay
mm hmm
black for sunday
on the l c d  oh
of course what do you think strawberry sensors
very useful


lounge meeting

alright good
so huh interesting in interesting mm mm
it makes sense
so uh this is
what a design
it's my turn mm hmm let's see if this yeah if you meet
the evaluation criterion

yeah so evaluation please
so you made a very nice prototype and um i think we now need altogether to
try to evaluate it to see if it makes sense to do it if it fulfils our
what we want to do and things like that so mm
uh next slide please
as you know before going and uh creating and producing these strawberry
uh remote control it's very important to first verify if it makes sense if we have a chance to sell
it uh so we need to evaluate it um try to do it in a constative way and as
much as we can
to so what i propose is that we are going to to have this scale from one to seven one
meaning that ye yes uh it fulfils uh the the criterion whatever it is
and seven meaning no it doesn't fulfil at all and we're all l going to list all the criterion i'm going to go to that
next slide and together try to evaluate this according to this criterion and from
one to seven and then we are just going to have an average which will give us the value of
our uh remote control so maybe we can have a look at the criteria
so these are the criterion uh i'm i thought were important of course this can be discussed
but let's let's see so let's vote so we have fancy here
and we have the scale
from one to seven
with four in the middle
so
what do you think is it fancy
it is very very fancy or have you ever seen something like that
yeah of course what do you think
is it
the weight is later now we're we're on the fanciness now i think it's quite fancy
it's uh
yeah so no it's it's one yeah o one means it's yes a very fancy and seven mean
no at all so it's one or two what do you think two okay so here two
up then we have uh technology
so what about technology we have uh we have speech recognition we have location based we have l c d 
change colour i mean that's very
quite d i think it's a one for that at least at least a one yeah
robustness uh huh
so let's suppose my daughter take it and um and through it away do you think it makes sense that it's going to live again uh maybe not the prototype let's try
oh my god okay we just lost one strawberry so not at all
it is
yeah yeah
so it's not so bad i um uh i would say three
yeah that does make sense yeah
useful well so the question is does it have uh the minimum requirement of re remote control so i don't know these buttons are uh it not clear but you have at least uh next produce
uh it depends on the okay
so but for instance because the l c d  is not uh touch control touch screen you cannot go to channel twenty five directly
directly
yeah
oh it's a jog dial okay
uh huh
okay
yeah
okay
it's much longer than that that being two two five no don't you think so may not okay we can go that's uh you're right
that's it's less uh yeah but it's it's nice because people anyway don't go there but
so what do you think for it usefulness seems to be useful
both
yeah
yeah
up down or left right yeah
that
cool
i would say then uh
two or three two or three two
okay two
so size and weight
is it the the the effective size and weight that the is it uh real size real weight or because it size is going to be that yeah
uh and and
it's going to be lighter because this seems to be very heavy f i mean for my daughter for instance not sure if uh she can use it
so should be okay
up to three for that because i'm haven't seen the weight so i must not uh colour and shape
well so colour it seems that we have the several colours for the l c d  but um
it's not very clear what is the colour of the sh the sh the case it's a
it's going to be titanium okay okay that's nice i think it's good okay
yahoo
well y you know it's this uh fruit and vegetable year so

uh i think usefulness is m as as i rem um just have to remind you that usefulness is much less important than fanciness whether it's fancy or not now it we have to decide but this if it's
uh huh so that they will that maybe the fruit may be here instead

so it seems we are not so clear on the shape uh

i suggested three because uh everybody s doesn't seem to be convince although it's quite you have good arguments but
and uh the last one is adaptive this is not r maybe not as important as the other one but uh can we adapt it to each each personal use
great fully adaptable that's yeah so you can fit into your palm okay that what else can we need you do you think you are gonna be able to do that with ti titanium as well
it's fudge yeah yeah yeah fruit titanium yeah well i if if this is if you are ready to do that then i think it deserves a one
okay
now we have to do the average
who is good in math
okay two point one seven that's nice two point one seven out of seven i think we have a good
good thing well that's all i had to say about the evaluation so
it seems to be good yeah we have uh
yeah
yeah okay thanks

ah ha
so so how many batteries do we need one battery
good
why two
say no no ne never install
two batteries or one
only one
no no but no no no no way
yeah you never use uh excel good
it's twelve bucks
twelve bucks twelve and a half i think
okay
okay electronics so
it's a simple chip simple chip okay one
okay
one or two one okay
so the case which one uh is it in the end
let's do a single curve
it's flat and curved
it's curvable
maybe there is a supplement for that no it's only curve okay let's go
this okay you d we tried we tried
so what is it t titanium mm that's expensive mm hmm
okay
let's stick to s titan special colour no because uh
yeah
oh
so the l c d 
two
yeah

it's going to be expensive


that's all no
oh i think no it's uh is it a scroll wheel and pe push button th this centre one or only only scroll wheel okay
you are trying to make make up make us up
no but you select with the two d the other two buttons no
that's true
yeah
yeah
it should stay yeah
she's very hard on this special colour
yeah no special material
yeah buttons are the standard buttons yeah it's only buttons these
nothing special okay so we are at seventeen dot eight
no the colour is in the l c d 
i no
we can just use this red it's

so what is are we supposed to cut things out now uh until we get twelve fifty

well
if i look at what is the most expensive things uh it's the l c d  and the speaker
yeah
yeah


mm hmm
so that would
so but if we select the hand dynamo it's okay we only we we win one that's already that okay let's do that

i'm not sure if this is legal
and
no okay let's see
yeah yeah yeah if click somewhere you'll see features yes it does
maybe put minus two so it looks uh more reasonable
yeah anyway no minus two
nobody will know it's not recorded is it okay we're on time good



no now we are exp exceeding i think it
is it
i think we're exceeding now we have to remove the
uh it's better i think they are counting uh we would prefer yeah maximum is maximum so remove one of them yeah okay okay we're uh on target


i'm just curious to see this uh my address chip on print
trick uh i would say it's the russian trick but anyway no they may have some their origins strange origins

no no no let's finish this meeting instead
what else
no this is right
okay so finance that's done are the cost under twelve yes project evaluation good
project process

safe uh asse uh safe assessment
yeah i think we've listened to everybody everybody could say what they thought
and uh
yeah when we see the results there is no doubt there maybe a lack of leadership
team work very strong i would say team work no problem
means
whiteboard digital pens
yeah i think white board is useful digital pens useful
new ideas found
yeah

but uh
yeah but uh then i i mus
that's true and there's uh one very important point we're on time
meetings finish when they have to or even before
the for meeting it's uh one of the most important thing

yeah yeah we have other uh remote controls to create
mm
mm yeah
hey just wondering if my uh what about the the pink the pinkness of that uh
they are working on a okay good
i think we are great there's no no other words for that
we are probably the best real reaction is uh yeah yeah

finished
ah celebration are the costs within the budget of course they are yeah is the project evaluated yes it is
to whom to the whole our company


so let's celebrate uh
i think the meeting
the meeting is over at least so we have to go out
yeah yeah yeah
all set
okay cool right so um basically i'm just gonna go over real quickly um some
news i've just got from the board on how we're supposed to do with this um remote control and then i'm gonna turn over to you guys to make
brief presentations um on what you've found and then we'll have a bit of discussion
so basically uh what i've just found out from the board i dunno if you guys got this email as well but it needs to be television only so no we're
not doing d v d  we're not doing anything else it's just gonna be a television remote um it also needs to
have the company colours included in it um so that's red and black and it has to have the slogan
case you guys forget the slogan it's we put fashion in electronics
um and no teletext i'm not sure what teletext is but i'm assuming you guys do so we don't wanna include that um in this particular design
for reasons that i don't really know there's but it's the board so there you go
so basically um given those guidelines which will have some effect on how we design we'll discuss it later i
mean 'cause it's television only we'll be able to change our uh um
well we can s sacrifice more function for a better television remote anyway so i'm gonna turn over to the industrial designer uh to go ahead and make a presentation on
oh right yeah
yep
might have to hit function f  eight but it looks like it's gonna come up
yep cool
brilliant

'kay
mm
'kay fair enough
'kay
is is there a way that we can use um modern types of polymers or mo modern types of plastics that maybe do
have some kind of aesthetic value um like if a white like if we talk about like well like on the lapt
on these laptops and other ones they use a a pretty nice you can do i is there some kind of nice colo der quality
plastic that we can work with
okay okay
great
thank you very much nathan um if next we can have the um user interface developer go ahead and make a brief presentation that'd be great as well
s plug yourself in here
mm
um hit function f  eight real quickly hold down
mm
there you go sweet
yeah sorry i couldn't get that g to use before
oh yeah look at that
mm hmm
nice
okay
great thanks for that ron
'kay yep that's you
give it a little bit
that's great thank you sarah right so um yep i'll just uh switch that back here i'll finish up with just a bit of discussion plan on for the next phase

right so i think we've covered most of these important questions through this um through you guys's presentations
um we've got uh y the industrial designer suggests uh or pretty much emphatically suggested
that we need to go with plastic um sarah she's recommended that we
go for simpler functions so fewer functions um but we need to decide who are we selling
this to you s your stats suggested that seventy five percent of people under thirty five wanted thought
about voice control um so do we wanna go for that or do we want to go for
an older demographic and my thought is um we've got w
if we're gonna go for a sleek look i mean we are putting the fashion in electronics um
yes so maybe this we should look into this younger demographic um so
uh we need to wonder ah h about how we make it better and smaller and faster um think we're constrained
to plastics very well we've got this idea ron was saying we need to think about uh revolutionising the
way it's looking um which might be easier given that we're going for simpler function and that we're only going for a telly
um so um
how th this voice operation thing is i think is a good idea um assuming that it's
doable um at least for the basic controls maybe we can balance it that way you know we can see okay you
can't say record alias tonight at seven p m  but we might be able to say um volume
up
mm
right
the difficulty wh would be in um i think like i you couldn't speak into the remote that you're trying to find 'kay you have something that picks up
a voice from far away
if it's hidden under the couch but then again you have this wee this wee thing you know that's just a little chip or whatever that has the page button maybe that could be voice activated too
yeah
or an isolated magnet or something like or you know something that wouldn't interfere i don't know that'd be the technical thing but yeah i like that i like that the voice recognition for the paging system
yeah
mm hmm
okay
mm
mm hmm
mm hmm mm hmm
okay
okay
absolutely mm 'kay um well yeah i guess we'll cross that bridge um
in a la slightly later stages of development um but yeah i know that's perfectly viable question mm 'kay
um so i'm seeing that we're gonna just basically focus on this young demographic group aim it at
them but then in a sense that its bells and whistles are available for anybody who wants them
but basically we'll make a sleek simple functioned um uh
remote control um i think this voice recognition thing is a we've got a market for it uh i don't think there's too
many we'd more or less be cornering the market on it as well we don't have many um
i appear to have lost my microphone mm
right um we don't have many people or there's not very many competitors out there that do that so cool
um right i guess we've c we've touched on most of this
the idea of a paging function a touch screen and face plates um
the thing with i see would there not be a we'd have to maybe sacrifice the face plates for a touch screen
okay
okay
okay
mm
okay
okay right
yeah 'cause then ha you would have to who all it's not like with cell phones like where you have a you know nokia model x  and then ten people make face plates for it we'd be just our model of pho of t remote control
mm hmm
mm mm hmm
yeah

alright well we can we can discuss that one further when we think about um whether th when we
do costs and so forth um true if plastic is dead cheap and if we're making the whole thing out of plastic anyway
um yeah we'll cross that bridge later um but yeah we will have to evaluate what's most
important um i think we've had a bit of discussion already on this thing n s there any other questions comments
that came up in these presentations
yeah yeah okay um
yeah i think that would be best let's based on what sh on what you guys have all said to me let's go for a plastic
built or uh b plastic cased 'cause tha tha that's easy on the cost try to look for some kind of high quality recycled plastic as you recommended and i think that's a great idea with a touch screen for the basic functions um
and we'll yeah tha let's provisionally let's go for a touch screen one with several submenus um for possible extra stuff that one basically put the channel and the on and off switch on the touch screen um do we have
mm wait a minute it occurs to me that if we have a touch screen people are going to have to recharge their remote controls
yet at the same time that might help for this whole complaint of it being lost
mm hmm but then again that costs as well hmm
do they okay
well i i don't think yeah i can't see anybody buying a lap a remote control that they have to plug in so we'd have to see some kind of new battery technology okay so let's go with a um touch screen
with um some kind of you know with with some kind of cutting edge battery technology
yeah well hey you know well it's it's worth looking into if not we can always default to just doing a a well presented plastic simple
you know so you know well yeah i mean you can put the we could i i dunno i mean i suppose we could put the the basics on the
centre easiest you know you know people know the channel and volume function make them large and easy to get at and then the the other the
other bits and bobs you know go through menu um w we'll do the aesthetics okay so we'll touch screen and the battery
focus on um uh presentation
um it's th uh with this voice recognition option as well um just as for the simple functions the um the on off channels volume um
and um a small paging function even if you can't do voice recognition for the paging you know just some kind of simple button that's just a i guess another infrared signal to the remote control and while to emit some kind of paging just a beep
um right so any comments thoughts before we break into go into the next round of individual work on this
w it's my understanding that if you were going to do a skin you'd need to have some way for people to
download or import skins into the remote control yeah i think perhaps
good idea but yeah i think that that one m might just be um
and they just yeah i think that one might just be out of the range for this particular a p d a  would they would makes a lot of sense for a p d a  'cause you're gonna be using it to connect up to things anyway but
i dunno what do you guys think
hmm
mm
yeah yeah

yeah
yeah i know i d it seems like it would suffice to have just the r r  on there
jus
but apparently not so
yeah
well fair enough um and yeah that would help the battery life too and if it the remote they do have to press a button for the remote to turn on but then again who wants to turn on a remote control kind of if i
oh to wake up okay or go into like a dormant mode okay oh yeah i like that i like the idea of um putting the logo in the boot up screen nice um
um cool so any last things before we break
alright fair enough
sounds good
i'm gonna save th a copy of this in case you guys need any reminders i'm gonna save a copy of this and the minutes that i'll do it in a second and put them in the shared folder for later reference
brilliant
that's fab guys cool

okay so do i unplug this bit here
okay right that's page one of my presentation
so the uh method we're gonna have to understand how remote controls work and res uh successfully complete
this project um remote control works as follows this is all pretty basic stuff you guys um
sends message to another system so there's an energy source involved in that like a battery or solar power
something along those lines there's an integrated circuit which is the microchip um and that actually compose
the messages and usually the way a a remote control works is it sends infrared bits to
another system a user interface controls the chip basically that's the casing and the buttons
and um accordingly the messages as well
so my findings um i just did a preliminary study here and uh i found that too much metal
in remote design could potentially cause interference with the ability of the remote to send commands and
too much metal can cause remotes to behave unexpectedly by receiving false signals um too much metal is used sometimes
and people pick up radio signals and the like and there's also the possibility of the remote catching on fire and injuring
the customer just think of those lawsuits that'd be really bad therefore i suggest primarily
plastic construction
um components just some ideas that i had um energy source it's kinda hip to be
eco friendly so i thought maybe we could do something with solar power with an alkaline battery backup
um the user interface i was since we can't use metal i was thinking maybe a high grade recycled
plastic the chip um silicon based chip i don't really see any way around that we can't
really be different in that respect um the sender well i'm thinking infrared 'cause
it is the industry standard multi channel that's a word i made up i don't really know what it means uh pal and n t s c 
compatible and uh probably a two hundred foot range uh and the receiver of course
is any number of electronic devices um but in this case it'll only be t v s um
personal preferences i really think that we should use plastic as opposed to metal um the company simply
can't afford this kinds of lawsuits which adm admittedly is gonna come at the cost of a certain aesthetic
value 'cause we were thinking
right
yeah that shouldn't be a problem um for example the plastic they have on your laptop there is something that's perfectly possible for us to do
that's the end of my presentation

is it plugged in well
there it goes computer adjusting
mm



mm

right i think it would be possible to uh combine the locator device and the voice recognition technology
with a simple command like locate and then it could start to beep and
therefore be found
oh yeah i think that's very doable
mm
it's a good point
yeah
mm
i was thinking uh
oh go ahead
yeah
gotta wonder though if we're adding so much technology to this one remote are we still gonna be able to meet out twelve pou
our twelve fifty euro you know goal for selling these things it seems like we're
not gonna be able to handle all these functions with just one microchip the microchip is probably the most expensive part of the
the whole mechanism so it's just something to consider
back to the uh the cost the material we have to ask whether we're going to include a certain
number of face plates with the package that's something i w for say we're including three or four face
plates it's gonna drive the cost up and the other question is if we do include them are we really in a position to evaluate
that market we haven't done any tests on face plates and whether
see if there if there's even interest out there off the top of my head it sounds kind of like a gimmick that wouldn't really go anywhere
yeah


can we afford to include one of those


right
okay
since we're doing uh touch screen do we wanna look into the possibility of people being able to input different
types of skins for the you know the actual interface part of it and things like that or is it just gonna be
one touch screen for everybody
what what would be on that touch screen 'cause you said earlier that we have to think about company colours and um
logo or something or motto i can't remember exactly what you said
's too much
think we just need to come up with a nice black and red interface on the touch screen that'd be okay
mm true

people aren't gonna want their remote to boot up and to see flashing things come on they just want it to be on and ready to go

th
well so here we have a uh my technical functions design presentation
um so a few of the requirements we need here uh we n basically need to operate
an electronic device it needs to be universal um and possibly uh operate several different types of devices
although we now uh find that uh that that's no problem um
so some of my findings um basically wanna send messages uh to a television set
um that would be any number of different things uh such as switch on the television uh switch
to the next channel that sort of thing i think we're all quite uh
quite uh intelligent and know know what a normal remote control does um
now some of the other things i found is a a complicated remote control sorry that we can't quite see
my red there very well but uh this remote control has many functions um
so it can do a lot of things but it uh it is quite complicated and most users will find it uh find
that they won't use most of the functions because they don't know how to use them and don't wanna take the time to learn how to do it
as you also notice it's quite a boring design um another remote control
slightly different it's a simpler remote control uh many less buttons but uh has
many fewer functions um m much easier for the user to manipulate and use um
it also has a bit of a cheap look and it's also quite boring
so my personal preferences revolutionise the idea of uh a remote control
um so attain the functionality of a complicated device but use a simple formatted display uh
for the user to to work with and i was gonna add another uh slide here but i didn't quite have time there
um just incorporating some of the ideas that we had previously like uh having multiple face but
it's uh
i can plug you in

sounds good
a little sticky pad to stick on top of your uh television and you just say something to into that and it
finds your
the other thing is we might be able to handle the simplicity of a remote control and kind of put the more complicated
things into a voice control so it could be sold to both the younger market and the older market and the younger market
could use kind of the voi voice control method and the older market might might k exactly and might consider
the older market could use the simpler design with the traditional buttons and what not
's definitely an option technically i've looked into uh costs of uh touch screen methods and what not they seem to be uh you know almost as cheap as a button method at this point

um i'm not sure that's sincerely correct i think if you kind of take the example of a mobile phone that uh
trying to pass a portion of the device is not interchangeable whereas the surrounding portions are interchangeable
we could have the casing the the face plates
well hopefully some people have people coming t over to w to hang out at your house and most people have their televisions in the living room uh
sure
well have we confirmed that we're gonna go ahead with a uh touch screen um
interface
so these new lithium batteries they last twenty years even with the touch screen
those new ones


be interesting
we put fashion into electronics
yeah uh i i'm i'm in agreement with that i'm wondering how we're gonna get uh we put fashion into electronics onto this device

i'm hoping for a subliminal maybe half a millisecond as it turns on

mm hmm

well all you have to do is touch the screen and it automatically goes on yep goes into a sleep mode
i've put my files in the shared folder as well
okay
gotta plug you in
very nice for your first powerpoint it's lovely


fine
it needs yeah
cool
looks like you're in okay
there you go

right
does that mean i'm up i think so okay oh that would be perfect thank you
slide show up and running
or not uh
oh there we go perfect
okay so this is me um basically i was looking through some marketing reports that we've
got and we had a usability test where we were actually sort like watching a hundred people
use t v  remotes and see what it is that they're using and then they filled out a questionnaire about what they like and what they don't about their general
t v  remote control practices um pretty much through testing we were finding out that
most of the time everybody's used to using changing the channel turning it on using the volume m
the majority of the time that's all that's going on the other functions happen for some people they're important but the primary uses are
really really basic um and so big complicated remotes like one we saw in the last presentation
are really not the general public's use they're not using a lot of it they don't need it
they even find it frustrating when there are all those buttons that they don't know what to do with
and um we also found out that uh fifty percent of our people their the worst thing about a remote is how often they lose it and then they can't find
it in the room so i think what we were talking about with a pager or something will really come into play
with a lot of these people um there's also a survey about what they liked about remotes and pretty much they
all think they're hideous and not very useful and the younger demographics are all really interested in
voice recognition options i don't know if that's something we're ready to look into technically that's up to the design people
but it is s something worth thinking about especially since the younger demographic's obviously the one that's gonna keep growing so
if that's the direction we're headed in it's something to think about um but basically it really is the primary functions
and getting it to look nice which are
the standards so it's a good start for us
need to unplug this
need it back
there you go
oh right
we're not catering to the pensioners of the world i don't think so
right
right
uh
right
yeah
oh that could work i like that
yeah something very basic
right
is that only gonna be within our two hundred foot range then
okay
yeah
mm
yeah
k
yeah
true
making it just an option yeah
right
are we still thinking about this screen sorry go ahead
the uh if we're gonna do this touch pad screen thing it would be still do we know if that's an option technically right now to that okay
okay
we're doing okay
'cause it seems like an interesting option especially because then you could have like your primary screen just be these you know four or five basic functions you can have
menu options or something to have all these other complicated voice recognition settings things that you're not gonna
use every day and that a lot of people aren't gonna use but it is an option there for this hi tech market
that sort of re is the sleek thing we're going for
true
worth looking into
yeah
true
yeah
mm hmm
mm
yeah
mm just the casing
mm
yeah
right
mm
right
well in the publicity of a face plate on a phone is you have it out and around it is sort of emblematic whereas you're just sit at home so unless somebody comes over to watch t v 
true true true
yeah
oh yeah
true
'cause it would have a docking base
yeah

can we afford that
and will somebody buy it if we don't
right
for twelve euros
it is
fair enough
the basics
mm
'kay
mm
and oh yeah the the fashion do yeah
right and then you're dealing with ports and cords and
yeah
for now
yeah nice
um
well but if we're gonna use a touch screen where it's gonna come on like on your cell phone it'll have your your carrier provider name come up first like while it's loading and then it goes away perhaps it could be like a temporary
comes on every time you turn it on and then that's it 'cause it is a bit much to have it like engraved on the back or something i think
yeah
y
yeah you would think but
if it comes from above
yeah

mm
we're good
yeah
hello again

mm yeah
okay
okay

yes
yes
your project manager
welcome to the conceptual design meeting
for real reaction
uh hello again uh it's uh the same as the last time uh uh also this
time there will be uh three presentations and we um must uh reach a decision on
uh the remote control concepts um uh and at the end
uh i uh when i finish it off i have some uh input from uh a master class
i uh visited information

the the the the the concepts on uh we uh where we uh must reach a decision on um
uh our from uh are of two sorts components concepts and user interface
concepts uh the first one is uh really about the the the the the total package uh
with uh well we have decided to do a do the uh with a touch screen that must be a case around
it so uh it won't be uh uh as breakable uh how how about the energy can you uh
can you reload it or uh just have batteries which you must exchange uh the user interface concept
uh with the type and uh the the supplements so uh where to put what button
and uh uh i would say uh jans can you begin okay at the end uh i will take notes uh and at the end of the minutes uh will uh be at the shared folder
mm hmm



one one little question um about the the material uh a soft material for a remote control
okay yeah thank you
mm hmm
oh


but you prefer kinetic
okay
yeah but you don't move a a remote control too much
and that's enough to to keep the energy level uh
okay

okay
thank you tim

yeah
dynamic dynamic look

a little artistic
okay
it's soft
that's the material the younger people want uh ain't it
just like the watch from seiko
yeah
i i uh i would prefer uh both uh too
yeah combine them

rubber yeah
yeah
mm yeah
me too yeah

okay

mm yeah
thank you
yeah do your thing tim
bring it on





yeah

flashy
yeah
yeah but wood is not a not a material you which you build a a remote control of
yeah but never seen one
case oh a wooden look yeah
okay
yeah
yeah
would you prefer uh uh that you can choose the colour of your uh remote control or
okay

okay

yeah
okay

maybe you could use your remote as a phone
there are numbers on it so uh

so that you say um s p s s  and it goes to uh okay


yeah but you don't use that th games when you watching television i think

yeah okay
you take your remote control with you

uh great






oh okay
uh
i think we can discuss a little about the the three uh kind of revolutionary things uh tim uh came with the parental control the games and the voice recognition uh
there's n not uh too much decision on uh that one so uh i think that parental control is a good function to uh to put in the remote i don't know how you think about it
yeah
yeah
no but i think most people uh find it uh much more important that their children don't watch uh
sex or violence uh on the television and uh wait uh ten or fifteen seconds longer so they can uh
finally watch it uh because of that uh
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
well i think that's a b there's a big market for it because uh you yeah you read many times in magazines
same kind of stuff and you heard on the news that uh that he yeah they believe that children
uh are influenced by the television and uh well we're we're aiming uh to
uh below uh forty uh years but there are a lot of uh people will below forty who have
uh children in young age uh who who want um to uh not watch uh violent or uh
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah yeah
that's a that's a better idea
yeah
yeah okay
yeah with and one without
yeah
yeah maybe it can work with show view uh you you can control your video recorder with show view uh
when you tick in a number it will uh start and end uh recording but maybe there's some option that uh
that t uh the kind of show view numbers are violent and that they are blocked out
yeah that's true
yeah
yeah
i wouldn't put it in an optional device that that then then then it becomes too much i think
if we do it we we must do it in a kind of ways that like a profile a parent profile and a family profile and otherwise
yeah

yeah okay and what do you uh guys think of the games in the voice recognition i personally think that that becomes too much
it's more like it gets you to the functionality but
yeah
yeah
yeah
okay and games
that would
okay so that will uh that that that must be in it you think
okay so the games uh are in it the voice recognition are not and the parental control are
optional
yeah
okay
yeah okay uh but uh will there uh uh like the first idea uh from uh you can buy it without and uh with parental contr control or are we going to put it in and uh just uh
yeah
mm yeah
yeah you yo yeah but most often not
yeah


okay so uh i think we have decided on the things that uh from janus the energy
the combination between battery and kinetic the case will be double curved and uh rubber
in a fr flashy fruity colour uh that with cover is removable
the buttons will be uh touch screen uh but there may not be too many buttons and
in the the menu structure uh there must not to be uh
five minutes to go uh too uh too many levels and uh it must be easy to use the parental control will be incorporated but it must be not too complex and the games are in it so
i think we have uh we have decided uh okay
uh little more
yeah
like a like a moat or s or something yeah
yeah but you have that in the
yeah you use the
yeah it's already incorporated a little in that concept
okay
we take it to the other meeting okay i have a little w uh little chat to do and uh then we uh finish i went to uh a master
class and uh uh two things uh are uh are uh can come in handy uh for us
first thing uh is uh we talked about knowledge uh management knowledge engineering and uh uh
the fact that uh that uh that the idea of knowledge uh sharing and learning knowledge from other companies is
uh like that it's it's uh very hot at the moment so it's it's mostly for the management
expert to to look what other uh marketing or did i said management oh just talking about
myself uh w
what other companies uh had to uh also with the the the the marketing campaign when they put on a newer remote
just some uh yeah import export and uh
another one uh they're a ha they're at yeah benchmarking that's the word i saw
i uh couldn't uh okay uh another uh thing is uh there were there there was a survey and
um uh it came out that um people like to buy things from a single large
provider instead of those who uh are partnering uh with us so we must uh we
must bring it as if uh real reaction is uh is big company uh a trustful company and uh
it has m
okay

i had a i had another idea to put uh uh the whole the whole idea of uh real
reaction and uh uh uh a single brand and uh uh that kind of thing when you uh put
on remote you see a kind of a just like when you telephone you see a little uh animation real reaction
remote and uh with the with the with the motto we put fashion in electronics
and then you go uh
the
yeah but w th the idea from this uh thing is that we must present it as a as we are a a single large provider who will stand on our own
mm yep yeah also also but we we are uh
yeah yeah y yeah yeah okay but uh think about that kind of things that's what they said in
the master class n uh next meeting starts in
thirty minutes so uh maybe you can go to paris and milan uh once again
the master class franz mehler's
uh very special uh next uh session uh idea that you uh the the industrial
uh development uh centre and uh user interface uh will work together on a prototype
and uh will drawing it on the smartboard so that's a kinda new uh thing and um
the marketing expert will uh will uh ke he will be keeping busy with the product uh
evaluation but the most uh specific instructions will be sent to you by email
yeah the well uh dids this what i uh what i heard i
not in the master class
so you uh just wait for the specific instructions and uh but i think it was a very uh very good uh session uh gentlemen
i will thank you all
and uh
give me a good evaluation

cheers see you in a half hour
but keep an eye on your uh laptops for a real uh
yeah but th there's there's still the my uh instructions that you will work together
that's not my problem bye bye
the project manager always works alone
hello
um project manager i have something to tell you i have a little problems with my laptop and uh s s s so i had a little less time to complete
no a little problem uh big problem i just thought um it didn't work anymore
the entire windows uh
it it hung

during lunch yeah
he's the master yeah
wow

oh have you considered the option of using a solar panel
w nah
mm
yeah
yeah
yeah
okay
yeah


th th yeah yeah

yeah
um


yeah
um i think you should use kinetic as a back up
a combination yeah
okay yeah
psycho kinetic yeah
buy a fifty cents battery and uh

well maybe i have something in my presentation to uh to cope with that
um isn't possible to make combination with kind of rubber is or bendable remotes where you've got a or do you think it rubber casing yeah
yeah
um well d maybe i can ask it right now the question that i have uh is it possible uh of is it necessary to make a touch screen square it isn't i think yeah
we're we put fashion in electronics so maybe we can uh
mm yeah
mm hmm
oh yeah okay i i get it
okay
that's good well as long a as long as it's it's uh it's firm and you don't uh it's not bendable or something i th i think that goes too far
oh
okay
it might even bounce back when you drop it on the floor okay
do your thing

spongeball

it'll float
tables
ah
hey

twelve fifty uh
when your parents are watching some boring program you can take the remote and do something else
take it
ooh s
mm hmm

in
okay um the interface contents
well that's a just simple powerpoint mock up i want to m make it more as dynamic for you so i'll draw there but the main concept is um take one big touch screen
um always display the primary buttons clear and visible
maybe even li like this with uh u uses of a lot of space and uh make the menu structure
changeable so if you press um system that's yeah well m multiple system
options can maybe five or ten or or one can fit in or maybe even a step further
when you want to um
t um have some other options that are not programmable with one horizontal button and
um other buttons can may be displayed here if that's necessary and um well how do
uh do we want to look at uh uh f um yeah does a remote look well it's you've gotta hold
it in one hand so um the middle like all remotes have to be in a little bit small so
you can put it in
inside your hands and some remotes you can use with your thumb but i think that's too difficult for this one so you can make it s a little broader
yeah and here and maybe use your thumb
on the on the main buttons and use your other hands
on the menu structure so here are gonna be the program buttons one two three four et cetera
and the the volume control and program control maybe
and down here
um i added this could be one uh big l c d  um the menu structure
so you can use it in uh in this way
um
one thing you've gotta keep in mind keep the remote clear of too much functions at the same time um know that if you are changing the menu structure here um
and well i still believe you should keep displaying the buttons but if you're programming the colour of the t v  do
not display twenty other options that are possible just keep it as simple as uh as possible
and do not use too many levels do not have to select a screen first and then brightness and then colour and un plus
and um push plus twenty times but just the um uh just in one button if possible
and um well you kn you all know the t v  levels um channel one two and when you get to n to uh to
ten ye and want to go back uh well you have a problem just m most most modern t v s you
you press one zero and it goes to ten and else to one and through after that so the
s a button less and um things like teletext put them in the menu things like um
um
yeah
yeah yeah w yeah i i find i must trying to uh tell it is uh volume plus and minus and this is program uh plus
and minus uh
yes
or if you're watching studio sports on uh on seventeen and your wife is watching some soap on
two well yes i think that's a good idea but um well m my preference
would to be put it in the menu structure and if you're using that button a lot of times well of course the menu
will still be displayed on the screen you just don't have to play games uh in between but if you're really
switching between two channels you won't have time uh to d use the other options
um yeah already already told that
yeah that's my conclusion
well i agree just put it in the menu structure somewhere
um yeah um system properties um parental control
yeah
mm
um w well yeah
it it has to be fast you don't want to to go down and watch the news at eight o'clock and turn it on and wait twenty seconds for for uh the log on screen and then remember your code and all kinds of settings
mm hmm
why
mm hmm
you c may use like when there's uh x p  uh a simple log on d you just push uh one or two or three and if you push parents then yeah to log in
yeah and if you puts a ye
uh huh and if you w you push p children uh you don't have to uh log in but you can only watch uh children's channels or uh okay well
yeah
well maybe um some idea on that just make through a remote as it is
but make an option to insert profiles 'cause if my grandad would buy this remote he
wouldn't want to bother with all all the all the uh things to do just make it an option in menu
ins install powerful profiles or something
um b well still some question i have about how to incorporate those ones you're thinking about some channels they
uh cannot see but well i i when i think oh yeah for the f for all the standard channels
and only for maybe after ten o'clock uh in the evening violent films and movies uh
will come and uh maybe maybe some some timing uh will be uh needed instead
of uh of channels because if you're watching uh i don't know you're in the at day uh cartoons
will come up m on maybe friday night i don't know


yeah the disadvantage vantage is that someone will has to send all the show view numbers of the programs that they remotes and edit it all will have to decide uh
that isn't possible
well yeah you could say if parental control is only it it'll go from fourteen to sixteen with the page up then but
mm hmm
yeah on a separate menu uh option
yeah well yeah i
a mail too from management that it's very popular to use voice recon recognition but i don't think when you're watching t v  uh hearing loud noises from the t v  someone screaming one and you f the channel switches uh yeah
yeah
w you can put it on chip anyway so uh
as long as it's isn't a primary feature of the remote but uh
optional in
but how we do it
well i think also it's a good idea buts very difficult to incorporate so we should make it too complex
is t some menu uh function you choose parental control and maybe four files will emerge from menu
where put it on but uh how how it's gonna work uh uh will f be a problem
mm hmm well
ye i i think best would be uh to put it in and make it an menu option you can put on yeah and you can just uh s when you buy it you can select um personal preference parental control on and the password or something
oh it's a p yeah
well maybe you just have to restrict it to what programs where the parent says you cannot watch channel seven nine and ten and you cannot watch all channels after ten o'clock and there's just some little uh clock in the remote
no no it's very simple there uh th i h i've seen some of remotes who have a clock in it so the remote does doesn't transmit when it's after twelve clock yeah

yeah
yeah
well that's to put it very blunt that's not our problem just have um the parents buy uh some glue and uh it's not not a part of the remote
you have to f yeah uh or make it ourselves very diffic
yeah
yeah
okay


okay
oh
yeah i'm listening
um well
what i was thinking about is just a menu structure when you don't use it is simple and when you push uh system properties uh entire list pops up with e ev all kind of f stuff you can program

som some bench marker
oh
uh logo yeah yeah

yeah
well you can show somebody a logo for point five seconds they'll still remember it and it it l linger on every time you see it
very annoying
yeah
yeah i it's ok for f
oh for the next meeting right


um
stay here and

p 
ah no new email
okay
thank you thank you very much
yeah
uh huh see you
yeah here or uh
yeah if you got a no so stupid manager
hi





yeah sure
okay
uh let me see i think it's this one
ha
right uh well i'll be talking about the components
uh what i did was i reviewed previously used items uh by uh two two
uh different uh age groups uh below forty five and above and uh
i just uh watch what the differences are and i checked uh well what what d do we want and
how can we uh d aim a at uh the target group well uh what i found
was that a senior um
senior citizens uh
ye ah it's it's okay uh they well they like more the they like the traditional materials
like wood and and such more wood and chrome and uh uh they like uh straightforward shapes
um uh they they they they like luxurious uh styles where whereas the young and dynamic
they like a more uh soft materials
think of the teletubbies for instance uh uh soft and fluffy and colourful and well
uh shapes are curved and round y y you get the picture and uh they like sports and gaming and
that gives them uh the vitality uh so w well uh firs yes
yeah
no i'll i'll get to that you you'll see yeah
uh well f first off let's start start with the energy w i uh i had a choice between uh a few different uh
sources but uh the two basic sources that i found were the best possible were the battery
uh versus kinetic uh kinetic that's when you move something then uh it gets energy
i figured well that's ki kinda high tech when when you have a remote control that well when you pick it up it has power that would be actually very nice uh i figured well we could also use a battery that's a bit
yeah yeah yeah you c just you have to shake it around a little bit and then then it d then it has some more uh energy well y you could just go for a battery or you can go for both
yeah i actually did but uh the thing is about solar panel is you have to have l uh light
well sunlight preferably uh and you you could you could use normal light but uh you
wouldn't get the same amount of energy that you would from a battery or something
uh for uh ultimate b uh n uh use of uh solar panels you could actually use uh
you could use uh solar panels but uh you ha you'd have to implement them into uh the remote
control leaving you uh a bit less space for the interface
so uh so i i it it wo what's actually i i c just in f i've figured it out that well uh seeing that you'll always be uh within the l uh distance of t v  and the from t v  there comes a a a whole bunch of light
so it would actually power itself uh from a t v  but well you just take up all the space and you wouldn't
uh have the full amount of power actually used so i i prefer kinetic because
it's uh well the costs aren't that much higher and um ju just a bit
more high tech than than a normal battery i mean if
no but uh d well you pick it up and you press buttons and y well you
yeah well uh actually it is and it it if it isn't you just shake it a bit and and add add with power up again but what l what jarek said you could you could use a battery that you'd just keep it on the recharging whenever it moves and for rest you'd just add juice on the battery
exactly
and so that uh uh well f furthermore you you we uh checked
uh the cases we have uh different options uh concerning the cases you ha i you sim uh you simply add
a basic uh standard uh model uh it was kind of square and uh i figured that's a bit boring
so you you we could go for uh the single curved or the double curved um single curve it's just a well
uh you know it's just uh a nice curve or but but you could go in a in an double curves and that's
like several different dimensions that gives you an whole new uh effec
yeah that gives you a younger and uh more high tech look i f i figured but that uh we'll discuss later
what
you want me to draw in three d  uh yeah i ca i ca i could i could show you i could show you well uh let's say y uh you uh
let's say that's your standard uh
that's a bit your d standard design but you could actually go like uh something like this
and then uh in three d  effect you could go
so y you you just
yeah this is a this bit uh difficulty in i didn't take a major in art so but but you could have uh uh a whole new uh the back back the the the depth you could you could uh just play around a bit with you you don't have to use standard uh
yeah you could y it leaves more space for creativity uh that might be an idea but just
a well furthermore uh well uh plastic versus rubber you we could choose uh what uh what's better plastic
um or rubber i i ch prefer rubber because it feels uh yeah
yeah it's soft and it's that i like soft yeah yeah i mean uh
plastic uh is plastic also has that cheap feeling to it like plastic uh your your i usually associate
plastic with uh something that's cheap uh that's maybe just me but uh we could uh
uh oh talk about it later uh furthermore buttons uh traditional uh or a touch screen well we discussed it in a previous meeting so i figured i'll just leave it at the l c d 
and uh chip set well uh if we are going to use traditional buttons we could go uh with a simple
chip set but uh if we decide to go on a n uh um l c d  screen
we would use an uh we have to use an a advanced chip set and that would bring uh the necessary costs with with it
so that's something we th have to keep in mind if it isn't uh manageable uh budget wise we'd have to go over to uh to sim to simple buttons

yeah
yeah probably
yeah probably but but uh yeah that's that's that shouldn't shouldn't be uh that big a issue
i'll i'll i'll just add uh uh i put a big summary here so we could discuss it a bit uh what i what
are your ideas concerning battery versus kinetic
yeah you you you should we should a combination uh you use the battery and w charge it up with kinetic when you pick it up it charges up
yeah
yeah yeah i know
yeah i con exactly what uh what do you think you agree
yeah both
okay uh well that would bring the m m some more costs but i mean the
who cares right that's the project manager's problem
yeah well fifty cent uh uh why doesn't and then we have single curved versus double curved that
okay no we'll we'll just wait and uh uh plastic versus rubber any ideas uh rubber you
uh i figured it will be m rather than hard nah rubber c uh this is a casing yeah rubber casing because well if you use an uh d a touch screen uh it's just a casing uh around it so um you could go for plastic but i figured
i i i would choose rubber
well m i don't know no
yeah
that isn't

yeah that would cover it that that would solve the problem
so mm uh uh so uh so what are the opinions uh rubber or plastic i i i prefer rubber yeah you too you sure you you you seemed to hesitate a bit
yeah it it shouldn't it shouldn't flop over when you hold it in your hand uh no that that that that's gonna the the chip set will hold it firm in place and uh and and uh and a l c d  screen also
yeah it m might it might uh tra uh traditional versus l c d  well i figured
we we all set on that and uh then also the simple versus advanced well i figure if we go for l 
l c d  we we should have the advanced so that shouldn't be a problem okay well that's my uh
uh you're welcome



well the teletubbies sh
well you could you you could well uh
yeah



well i actually saw a phone that you could use as a remote so yeah
hey that might be a next step

well yeah
you take your uh remote with you to school
yeah

very nice




i don't know if it's worth uh the time and effort we are going to spend on it because well it's a simple function but it's gonna
take a lot of resources and a lot of time um to programming it because you'll have to start working with
the profiles and such and i'm not sure if it's actually worth uh investing that much time
and effort into it i don't know what



but well if you want to i i i if we in incorporate uh
the parental control uh let's say we do and and well whatever cho uh child just goes up to the t v  and presses
up for instance well uh nob nobody's stopping the child from uh
well checking uh the channel
but that
well i'm not sure because um for that to happen you d you will have to receive a signal from the uh remote control so it would yeah have to be constant uh constant signalling
what m what may be better is to incorporate an uh a separate device that uh that you can program
with the remote control and that uh provides parental control for instance and that's just an optional
uh device so there's n that's there's uh besides uh the remote control you'll have a separate uh
yeah
yeah that's true that's true but uh at same instant same happens when uh you have remote control so
but only difference is uh the uh the people buying the remote control will now get the f added feature of parental control and those people wouldn't uh necessary want it so you you'd be
yeah


yeah i can see games happening yeah
yeah that will be nice
well i don't know i i figure if you had two different remotes you could bo choose one with uh well
uh uh a receiver in it so you could actually easily uh build in
uh parental control but it would would be uh more expensive so a and that that way uh you could make
cheap model and a expensive model could ma make the uh simple model and the deluxe model uh for instance
yes they are yeah
yeah you you have some t v s any
yeah that is true that is true
well yeah you could you could easily you could easily you could easily to the mote control but you still have the problem about uh the television itself
yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah
yeah that is true yeah that is true yeah you could you could you could go like uh that that would actually make uh things a lot more easy you could just blame it on television and uh make it their problem
yeah i figured i figure we could do that yeah yeah sure
uh i'm not sure what marketing thinks about it but



user profile
well yeah you you could actually build in a function that you can program it yourself for the more advanced users
yeah which buttons do you want to in it because you can you can like build in a back forward button and uh some po somebody would just want to watch two channels
yeah you could you could m have people want uh want that
ah yeah sure



well if you if you have the l l c d  screen you can you can uh have a small logo i uh at the bottom and it could just stay there yeah that spins around or something
hmm
yeah yeah something like that a small icon



so we're going to work together right now

definitely
well thank you too

you wish m aye cheers
hey
yeah uh i'm not sure if we uh we because i saw something about individual actions
hey project manager
what was it problem
the laptop
it hang hung
ha ha
oh
project manager
you're our project manager



master
master of


i'm sorry okay go on



yeah but when the power gets low you have to shake it or something
uh and uh uh
hmm
mm yeah it's too less space


and when the battery doesn't work i usually shake it too so like slamming on it it's exactly the same

hmm
but are you going to draw it
the yeah
yeah
uh i c i can't imagine
i can't imagine how how how it looks like
yeah
design
mm hmm
uh

oh okay
okay
oh okay
okay
well i think uh we're going to sell tell ten millions of them
so uh i bet a big company in uh korea or taiwan like uh samsung can give us uh a big discount on the chips so
u usually chips are uh aren't more expensive than one dollar
so
that that shouldn't be a real issue i think

yeah a combination
yeah
like an uh aku uh
acu uh yeah well yeah
combine them
okay
of course fifty cent
rubber
rather hard
yeah
well i think that touch screens are generally square but it's the case you put around it that makes the shape hmm
yeah okay but if you have a square uh l c d  screen and you put a case around it that has uh like bulbs or that that covers part of the l c d  screen that
that's it's custom customisable and
yeah me too
mm yeah



yeah
can i uh do my thing it uh
expert map
okay uh
last week
i went to uh paris and milan for some trend watching
for marketing
our research and development department and i went to paris and milan
in paris and milan we uh asked different people uh differing in age
and in income uh the amount of money to spend um what they like
in design uh and material nowadays
findings our main audience uh so that's people below forty uh prefer the following at first the colours of fruit
very basic colours like janus explained um fresh colours uh
green red uh strawberry red uh yellow banana yellow
um considering material um

yeah they like spongy material like yeah a sponge ball like a s soft material janus m uh mentioned it also i think he did some uh
some findings himself you wer you weren't in paris okay like this
like big uh g flashy colours fresh it's nice i think
okay our secondary audience uh people above forty a forty years in age they like the dark traditional colours uh
yeah uh materials like wood that
no n j just j just a w
no okay but just just a wooden uh look
like uh you have those fake uh fake panels on the floor the that isn't wood anyway but okay
but that's our secondary audience so uh we decided to take
mm yeah the people below forty so that this doesn't apply
'kay the third uh there're some overall thoughts about new remote controls they have to look fancy
um they should be technological in innovative
that means uh there have to be fancy things in uh and easy to use but that's common
my personal preferences
we have to aim at a mu at the main audience and uh therefore use fresh colours
uh i'll i'll come to that in a second point here think about removable covers as seen in mobile telephon
telephone market to customise your own remote control like the nokia uh the removable covers
uh just put a red on it and go to the shop and buy a green one
uh a third material being used uh could well be stuff like rubber um
two advantages uh it fits within the current market trends and uh
it adds safety to your remote uh when you drop it so
uh to come back to your question i think uh and the people in milan and paris also think that uh the rubber should be pretty hard like uh
seen on regular mobile phones
actually they have a lot in common the phones and the
yeah yeah okay
yeah exactly uh in my second sheet of personal preferences uh we have to reconsider the speech function uh recognition uh it's very innovative innovative
yeah like something you you can see that the market is just screaming for new technologies like speak uh speech recognition and stuff but we have to keep the cost in uh in mind but it
yeah it it can be uh very expensive 'kay second uh building games like snake or tetris to amuse the younger users uh also the link with uh mobile phones uh
no but no okay but you don't use games when you're d when you're making a telephone call it's just the same
yeah
when you're at college uh no you al you also take uh t you take your ipac and go uh play games yeah yeah well i do that but okay and um
and third i stick with it the log in functionality uh with the slogan take parental control to a new dimension
that's it



yeah uh what do you think about a back and forth come up uh button l like in uh internet explorer

yeah okay but does it that is for uh going from four to five but if you go from two to eight and you want
yeah and on two that you can switch switch easy
yeah it is
yeah
mm no
that's it
okay

yeah
yeah but
what i see uh how i see it is you put it on the the remote and then you have like a windows log on screen with parents children
something like that and w when you want to use the parents uh option you have to
yeah ok
yeah yeah
yeah pu push parents that then then then you have to uh go to three digit uh log in like two one three and it's in
it automatically goes yeah
mm hmm
mm yeah
v violent t v 
yeah of course
yeah
yeah w it just has to be w when it's deliver out of the store it has to be just simple and plain but if you want to install it personally uh
if i got kids and i could choose between uh two remote controls one uh w with parent control and one without and i would would buy the one with
i th yeah

yeah

yeah but yeah but that isn't possible
yeah
hmm
yeah
yeah and
and and you know w uh when you install another device uh children can still go up to the t v  p pop open uh the thing and and and g
go to a channel
yeah yeah of course but
yeah
ah it's yeah yeah okay but it's just an an added feature feature
mm yeah
yeah like f voice recognition is too much i think but games it doesn't
yeah
that that doesn't c that doesn't co
yeah that that doesn't cost a lot of extra resources i think
yeah it's it's in it but too ma i i think so but
yeah
to put yeah to put it in always
yeah but t v s aren't capable of sending
yeah
i thought they were just
a able to receive yeah some but
yeah
yeah j just some rules
yeah okay but on the t v 
at least my t v  is a is a compartment which you can press and there are buttons uh behind it which you can use if you d if you don't if you don't have a
yeah
yeah
yeah of course
yeah
or j yeah
ah i have to uh consult my legal advisor about it


consensus
oh oh i i have one thing left maybe for uh jerome um the views
maybe it's uh handy to build in an expert view and a simple view
yeah like at in the experts view you have a lot of more buttons
yeah
mm yeah okay fairly enough yeah
yeah wh which buttons you like or not
yeah
yeah just leave the other numbers away
okay go on
a little chat


marketing
management yeah that's my function to okay go on


how i know a marketing name for our product
r  th r  to the third power r  three real reaction remote
mm hmm
bling

yeah yeah okay but it has to be like a split second because you have to put in a code also and
yeah

yeah
that spins around like all the time
it it's just like a uh globe in internet explorer
okay

who uh
who who gave you the master class ronald betenberg
okay thanks

ah
in the master class
yeah
me too
thank you too lord
'kay guys lot of success
okay
right
conceptual design meeting right okay so
right well um from the last meeting i was trying to send you the minutes but uh it didn't work out too well so maybe in sort of um
quick summary of the last uh meeting i can
quickly give you
what we what we had uh right so
wishing i hadn't closed the damn right so we had the fact that we're gonna have the the logo uh the company
logo in its uh colour scheme incorporated onto the the device the remote device
we had uh made our decisions about uh
made our decisions about uh
the device itself that it was gonna be simple to make it uh
enable us to complete the project in time we're gonna have uh effectively two pages a front page
which had the uh features that the uh the customers most wanted and then the uh the backup
features on the second page so that it could uh
meet the technical requirements and the customers wouldn't have to look at them too often only as and when required so
so basically what decisions uh have we uh made uh have there been any uh changes
right
three presentation yeah so yeah fine

okay
mm hmm
what would be the cost do do we know

mm hmm
mm hmm
with the printed circuit boards you were going for the
mm hmm
but are we going f r right
so are we able to make that decision now in a sense that this is the point at which we're discussing
that issue so would it not be best to rather than i mean one way is to do each
of the presentations and then make decisions going back to the various presentations as they were the other way would be to
do the presentation and then make the decision at that point in time
'cause at that point then you've got the details up there so if we wanted to know for instance that
the scroll wheel required the regular and what required advance then if we were able to see that down
then we could make the decision at that point in time and then that would be the end of that issue does that make sense

mm hmm
no the scroll wheel required the regular so the
hmm

okay the display requires an advanced chip the display requires an advanced chip which in turn is more expense
okay
down
right okay
so so we're going for p okay so is um
simple push button
mm hmm
so if we go for the simple push button so effectively we're going for the simple printed circuit board are we or are we going for the regular
mm mm but is there any other i mean okay that's true for
the for for that element but we have to take all el elements into consideration
and so if there is one element that requires the more expensive one or say the regular one
or the more advanced then that would have to be the same for all of them s
right
mm hmm
no

mm mm

okay
simple circuit board simple push button
okay w w kinetic you were you were wanting to go for the kinetic power supply
mm hmm and how does it get uh charged up
okay
okay so the speech recognition was are we going for speech recognition no 'cause that required the advanced
i had speech recognition requires advanced req require
oh so okay speech recognition you reckon then is s simple and so we would want it in as an extra because it doesn't appear to cost too much would that be
in fact it wouldn't really cost anymore would it
and then have to change all change everything at the last minute
okay s
sorry
yeah i've found that try and get it back
so you were saying the scroll buttons
mm hmm
well we're to go for the international market rather than a local market but that that wouldn't necessarily preclude
the one thing that you can often do with products is you can uh make small modifications
so you have your basic model which you would sell at whatever and then you could have additional
features in you know like a you'd have model one model two and model three and therefore you can sub divide
your market up but that's really where your field is
anyway you could add on for an extra package but on this basic one i'm reckoning that we're going for the basic model
to be discussed here and that uh you would have for future reference the possibility of adding in extra
features at extra cost to take care of specialist market segments
is that so so what are we deciding to do here
right
mm hmm
uh the fi yeah the finder function rather than as a speech function to find your remote okay
hmm
so you'd have a finder feature rather than a voice recognition feature and you were talking
mm and you were talking about scroll buttons
okay b
alright so we're just gonna have the the rubber buttons was that right
okay so not to be focused on
good in in flip it round in ninety degree a hundred and eighty degrees and have it up and down an upside down v 
so that would show that volume was going up whereas the one underneath would see the volume going down
right
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah you could have volume up and volume volume up down
and like that and 'cause the idea was to have limited um it was to have
sizable amount of information on it limited number of buttons 'cause it was sixteen buttons wasn't it
that were
okay
you know yourself


well you were just talking about you've got to be careful how you shape your buttons 'cause you're can mis direct people and i would've thought the functionality 'cause the people get cheesed off by things by having to read instructions et cetera so
 
okay now yeah stand by button no th that that incorporates the trend whilst at the same time not confusing people if you're looking for functionality
but what are they gonna be next yeah what are they gonna be next year but but th but okay
but you you can incorporate the tr if y if you change all the buttons then you've got the problem that this
year's fruit and veg next year's uh i was gonna say animals or elephants or w whatever
that means you're constantly changing your production schedule and you've gotta make different moulds and everything else so that's not a good idea i
would i would suggest
well
ah d d but if mm hmm well yep
was that in the sort of fashion sense that this or was the spongy feel was that uh sort of fashion it was wasn't it so the
mm hmm
rubber buttons require rubber case
uh so yeah the m the main problem is how f how frequently do the fashions change 'cause in essence
in the production you want things to stay you want to basically mint them out 'cause if you've got
fashion changes and that you're incorporating then it means that your stock is
um is last year's stock and therefore you're selling it or having to sell it at a discounted rate which you wouldn't want to do
whereas if you kept the product the same but you could have a difference from year to year uh it
seems to me that you could incorporate a fashion statement if you like rather than changing the whole
kit and caboodle you're just changing one aspect like like the standby button or something
like that and especially 'cause then you could make it something that
well you might be limited in space that yes well you two are obviously gonna find that out fairly
quickly when you move over to your kit modelling stage as to uh how much pl how much how much
how pliable is plasticine
hmm so you're talking there about uh changing
changing the casing
yeah you you could do a colour change so therefore you would yeah yeah i mean that's effectively what they did with the with
the mobile phones was to have some in blue some in red some in rather than all in black or you know which four
do you want as long as it's black but uh so

yes oh that's true uh that might no
well not necessarily because you could have your company uh we're we're meant to be finishing up
you could have your company badge and logo i mean a lot of um computers for instance like like on the one you've
got there it actually has a sort of um stick on badge so what you would al all you would really
need whether it you know whether the casing be w any colour could be any colour but that badge
would then have to stick out on top of it so that uh in a sense with a
with a logo like that because it's on a white background the only colour that it might not stick
out so well on would be a white casing
'cause you you know you're sort of you're badging it and in fact a lot of companies get somebody else to make them and literally just badge them
themselves with their own uh badge over the top and in fact the way they've got that there even if you had that on a
white which is the predominant colour of the uh the windows badge you'd
still be able to see it clearly from you know a white casing uh product so

it's uh in in the house isn't it i suppose
so don't change case change case colour and we're sort of saying no to that
yeah
sounds reasonable
if you're going for fashion trends like that they'll need t you'd have to have interchangeable cases so that you could or 'cause otherwise someone's gonna have to buy a complete new remote rather than just a case
okay

one one thing to cons one thing to consider is that in some ways you want
um by having a fairly standard case it means they can all fit together on top of each other therefore for storage
purposes in shops and the like and it makes it easier that you can if you can store them up on top of each other whereas if you do um
fancy things with it you then gotta put it in a ca a a packaging box that that does that
and the cost of packaging could be quite important vis a vis the total cost of the product
so but
no
mm yep
oh right
s so do you wanna go for curves more curves we're meant to be f we're meant to be finishing this meeting in about a minute or so
okay curved or double curved so it's single curved
yep
yes yep
so we've got spongy feel buttons as well have we as well as or w or was that
so it's rubber buttons so it's not really spongy feel buttons it's just rubber buttons with a rubber case right
and the standby button is gonna be different
okay so what what shape are we making the standby button a apple oh oh sorry


a red apple is it
sorry what was that last thing again there
right much option on that i thought you were going for a single curve and
alright
right so shape of buttons simple
okay so that's that i guess we should now go away and get these things
sorted out i guess you two are on plasticine duty or whatever okay
so um
okay
i think we all have a presentation again so if we go through those and then um
shall i go first again
i see this a little more smoothly than the last one

okay right let's get started um
basically the uh for the um i'll back actually
for the components design um next step is basically the the way the remote's
gonna work is still the same idea as before we still have the user interface which is all the buttons
we're gonna incorporate then there is a chip and still the sender so um
yes including the power s supply as well um i'll go on to my findings in each of
these areas uh first in the power supply we have the option of just the standard battery
um there's a dynamo any of you think of kind of like the
the old torches which you wind up um there's a kinetic
option which if any of you've seen those new watches which you kind of you power up by waving around um it just requires a
small amount of movement which would mean the batteries wouldn't have to be replaced
um that's one option but i think that was gonna cost a little more and then there's solar cells um as
a final option for the buttons we have um an integrated push
button which is oh just to say all all these are um supplied by real reaction so i guess for the
ease of for quickness and ease we should take them from at least like one of these options um
so for the buttons there's an integrated push button which i guess is just the same as the standard ones this says it's uh
similar to uh the button on the mouse for a normal for like uh like modern computer
um there's a scroll wheel
which is you know the new mouse has just got like the centre section which you can scroll up and down which may be for the volume you could
do do that um one issue for the buttons is depending on which material
we use if we use rubber buttons then it requires a rubber case so we have to take that into consideration um
moving on to the printed s
um that's on the next i th i think the there wasn't too much difference in the cost
that that related to the actual buttons but it does affect the printed circuit board um which is the next section
basically for the circuit board which is the middle it's just see it down there the chips like the like the workings
of the actual um of the remote the firm supplies a simple a regular
and an advanced um circuit board and there's different prices according to each so if we've got the scroll
wheel for one of the buttons that would require a slightly more advanced circuit board than if we just had
a standard um push button
um one final thing we came up with was some information on the speech recognition there's a small unit available
through the company um which obviously would be an extra cost but it wouldn't affect the size of the remote
too much um and i guess that would require a more advanced circuit board so there is an extra price
in that sense there is th sorry an extra cost in that sense um going to my personal preferences um
i thought possibly for power we could use kinetic um which is the idea of the watches um
that you move you move the remote around to power it up and this would avoid batteries running out having
to replace batteries and such like um for the buttons i thought
we'd probably get away with just having the standard um push buttons rather than the scroll wheel
um and for the circuit board again depends on which features we want in the actual in the remote
so if we wanted the scroll wheel and wanted the voice recognition um then we'd have to get a a more costly circuit
board and that's it
um i it kind of depends um if we're gonna have the speech recognition we'd have to probably get an advanced one i'm guessing uh but i don't know so that is something i'll have to look into
um that's a that's a decision for all of us um
yeah yeah
we decide yeah
um maybe w
um
yes
is there
um
we could do yeah um yeah we should
as i say it only specified that we need a more advanced circuit board for the scroll wheel it didn't the voice recognition came as a separate piece of information um
yeah if if you down um
it's just this bit at the bottom which i've highlighted but the scroll wheel requires a mini m minimally a regular chip which is in the higher price range
also the display's for something else which we decided against um but that bit
and note that the push button just requires a simple chip so that would keep the price down
'kay
so maybe just a simple push button and that would cut costs on the
did everyone get this on the speech recognition the um it was basically what we said before the idea that you record in a set
message and then it picks up that message um and replies to you so it is basically the concept we discussed
before um but then we don't know for sure whether it would require a more
complicated circuit board i'm guessing it would but got like the definite information maybe we should go on what we're certain of rather than
um if it's just the push button then it just needs the simple circuit board
so maybe that would be something separate yeah
okay so we'd have a simple circuit board and that would be an extra that would be in addition to it oh that makes sense
okay
yeah that makes sense so we'd stick with the simple circuit board and then think of the speech recognition as an extra
an extra possibility
okay um
um yeah i i thought so just for just for ease of not having to replace the batteries
um
it's um i think it works on the basis they have some kind of ball bearings inside it's um it's some
on watches which you you kind of you shake to power it up somehow the mechanism inside powers up
through movement so you'd you'd move the remote around a little bit and then that powers it up to use it
uh yeah i think did we decide it didn't affect the circuit board it just affected
it was just
oh no th that's what that's what i thought but maybe maybe it doesn't
um i think i might have got that wrong
it's it's just an addition thing it's um yeah
'kay
'kay shall i pass on to you now
i assume it would cost extra but
maybe we maybe we'll find out how much that does cost and have to decide slightly later
if you right click and then go onto a previous slide
okay right
yeah yeah
on the price yeah
'kay
i guess i guess we're going for the biggest market maybe not but
was it was it specified that we went for the biggest
so maybe the children's remote should be like a a next step but maybe i dunno for ours maybe we should
yeah
so you also said for going for the international market um that some some maybe older people might not like the speech recognition
s s so um
yeah yeah it w it would make it quite complicated where um ours at least keeps it fairly simple and then the
yeah yeah
yeah
yeah
yes yes
so maybe we could have like
yeah
yeah i i know what you mean so maybe we could have volume written on the side and then up and down on the on the buttons themselves
possible
mm
yeah yeah
yeah
yeah we got it down to not too many
um
are we are we gonna go through the design of all the buttons at the moment or are we gonna t
yeah maybe we should see yours first

'kay




well i dunno i i guess maybe fruit and vegetables may be popular at the moment but as we know how fickle the fashion markets are maybe
i mean it just seems realistic that the remote control market isn't the kind of thing which takes in
those kinds of fashion trends to something which is maybe more universal
we c maybe can imply a fruit shape possibly
maybe the spongy feel is something we could think about um
maybe still with a rubber design we could
um
oh yeah yeah one of the things were if you had rubber buttons then you had to have a rubber case
um oh no no no sorry it's if you use the uh rubber double curved case then you must use rubber buttons that's the way round if you have the rubber case then you have to have the rubber buttons to go with it
which makes sense
um
yeah
i suppose we maybe are limited in the fact that we still have to put the logo on the actual would or not
yeah
yes yes
maybe we could think of the the cases like changing with the fashions like the nokia phones where you could take the casing off the outside but whether that would be too much to incorporate in production whether that would just increase the costs make it more complicated
yeah the a the actual the sort of the look from the outside so where the buttons would stay the same and the general function of the remote would stay the same but you could change the the way it looked
yeah that's true
yeah
so it is a possibility um
oh okay yes that is
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah
and whether we'd have a big enough market to have this kind of like secondary market of selling the cases
might be something to consider
yeah
yeah i suppose where you you keep the remote hidden under the sofa most of the time
yeah less likely to
so then th th that would
yeah
it seems to make sense that we we'd just maybe stick with the standard rubber case and then have the standard rubber buttons as well
um
um
mayb
maybe curves give it like the slightly more aesthetic feel but the double curve wouldn't require us to perform miracles with the plasticine

mm hmm
yeah yeah so shall we go through quickly and just work out what we've decide on if we have to kind of

'kay so shall we quickly
we'll go for single curve yeah single curve
so did we did we decide on the kinetic power supply the one you move around okay um

oh we ca yeah yeah we'll still have the are we gonna go for the simple circuit board just to keep the cost down i th i think we can by by not having anything too complicated
um
um
and see we could always decide against it if something comes up that's just something to that we seemed to leave out
yeah it was just
'kay

we will go for the a a a apples apples
okay and then we're gonna are you gonna work on keeping the button design quite simple just like the
just working out what we're gonna do for the next time
um
yeah
'kay
and j yeah just keeping the sort of the labelling them labelling of them fairly simple as well fairly sort of self explanatory
okay
is that the end okay

thanks
yeah that's probably a better one to discuss it straight away
um i have a lot of the information there it might not be very clear
unless you want to plug it back in to yours
i think the scroll wheel um
yeah and if we're going for sleek and sexy i think a scroll wheel is maybe a bit kinda bulky i i've got um pictures well i've seen pictures with it kind of sticking off the side of it and they don't really look great
yeah a simple pushbuttons
hmm but
but the way that i interpret that um it doesn't seem to send out a signal to the telly it just it's like a parrot just rep reply replying to your message so i don't think it would effect our circuit board
yeah and i don't think you could really perform any of the remote functions with it 'cause the example that they've given there is good
morning coffee machine good morning jo it might be useful to say like where are you remote here i am jo
but i think that's maybe as far as that one could go
yeah just as a fun way to find it
and it says that i think it said the cost of that isn't too much
um i think it would be helpful to find it but i don't think it'd um
yeah i think so
mm hmm
i think
i'll just just check what it said
actually i don't think it really says anything about the cost but it says that it's already in the coffee machines so
like it's already kind of

um
oh that was quick um okay so very brief presentation um
from looking at the remotes that are out there at the minute none of them are particularly um sleek and sexy um
i haven't actually got the examples of the scroll button there um but there's some curved cases that you can see
uh a range of sizes uh all of them have a lot of buttons there um they seem to just have the rubber buttons
does that move it
it just seems to be skipping on without us doing anything
ah it's alright um there wasn't much more to say about that just rambling um some of the uh remotes that i looked at one of the models da did actually have voice recognition where you could um
where it was connected to the remote control functions and uh it was quite uh a swish model where it can
control uh four devices t v  cable satellite video d v d  audio
um so that's a bit of competition there so
i mean maybe it's better not to try and compete with that sort of thing and just to market it as a completely different um
like different viewpoint as a kind of finding your lost control rather than trying to compete with the functions um the scroll buttons as you've already mentioned um
there's examples of those but they don't look as sleek as other models and there's no real advantage and because it impacts on other on the materials and the price it's not great um
yeah th there was a specialist type of remote that we could think about um
there was children's remote where um they just had a very limited range of buttons and they were b uh bright and colourful and um you you could program them so that they could only look at certain channels
um but i don't know if that's really in our field but that's something that's out there
hmm

hmm
okay right well that's something that we can be aware of
um
i think because there's already um very good voice recognition technology out there and because ours might not cover the same functions that the leading brands do it might be a good idea to market it as a um finder function
yeah
oh yeah
different languages might not be compatible
hmm
yeah 'cause i think you program um this one yourself like to say like whatever you want to your question
hmm maybe unless something else comes up
um yeah i think um i think we've decided that it's gonna increase the cost and give no real kinda extra benefit and it's gonna decrease from the sleekness of it
hmm um and just to be aware that there are kind of specialist functions and specialist remotes but we probably don't want to focus on those like such as the children's remote
yeah um there was a mention just as kind of a warning about button design
um just to avoid ambiguity so it gave the example of
say your volume buttons for up and down they might both have a v  on for volume
um let's think how they did this
i'm just gonna check so i do this right
um what did they say
um i think the thing was that if you decide to do this to have triangular buttons um somebody might look at this one and say oh well this triangular button is pointing up and that's the first thing that they see
actually that can't be right can it oh well no they might see
yeah they might see this pointing down and think right that's gonna turn the volume down whereas the actual button's pointing up so the function is to turn the button up
so be careful what you put on the buttons and be careful of the shape that you make them because they might be kind of two um
contradicting kind of shapes
yeah
um and i think that's all i had to say for that
um so what was the decision on the um design of the volume button
oh okay





i think if you start making the buttons fruit shaped it might make it more complicated to use
yeah
maybe just one button say the standby button is quite kinda separate from all the other functions maybe that could be a little apple
and then that wouldn't get in the way of like kinda one to nine and it wouldn't confuse the numbers
hmm s
but i suppose as long as it's quite a subtle design um even if the design kind of changes
it seems like you're gonna have rubber cases as well as buttons
and that you can make them curved or double curved and that would be the kind of sleek and sexy look
oh right that fits doesn't it
right
and that would fit in with what we want wouldn't it for the spongy feel to have everything rubber
hmm

yeah and then you could have oh but you still would have to have the logo on every new case but you could have like pink cases for girls and red ones and things like that
hmm
but we are supposed to use the um company colour scheme aren't we we haven't really seen that yet
it might and we might be able to do both but it might clash with certain things
hmm
well if it's for young people um like the phone generation that sort of thing'd probably go down well and the market research has been on that side of things hasn't it

okay so if we just went for one colour of a rubber case
did we decide on the rubber case the spongy feel or did we think that that might go as a trend
uh we haven't really talked about uh the curvature of the case there's flat there's single curved and there's double curved
i'm not exactly sure what these things look like

well it says that
i'm not exactly sure um i'll show you
the remotes that i've got see how uh
let's just get that bigger
see how uh the one oh i'm not plugged in am i that doesn't help shall i just turn it round for time
hmm
um it's not very clear up there but you can see some of them have got kind of bulges like the second one and the end one uh where there's a curve there i'm not exactl i don't know if a double curve is maybe it comes up slightly or
but um it is a kinda sleeker look if you've got curves in there
definitely a single maybe a double
shall we go for single curve just to compromise

yeah
and the rubber push buttons rubber case
um and we don't really know much about the colour scheme or logo yet do we but possibly a sticker
yeah yeah and and the voice recognition we can use that can't we just to find it
without affecting the circuit board
yeah that sounds like it wouldn't do too much harm in a couple of years uh what sort of shape do we want
yeah so it's not too wacky
um i think an apple would be a good recognisable shape if you start getting into kinda aubergines and things it gets a bit weird
vote
shall we vote on it anyone got any suggestions right
okay ah well it could be red
yeah 'cause we wanna incorporate a bit of colour if we can once we find out um
yeah
yeah that seems pretty straight forward 'cause most of them will just be kind of mainly circular or like very plain
uh just to keep the shape of the buttons simple
ah just the uh shape of the buttons
yeah

yeah
okay
mm hmm
mm hmm
'kay
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
so are we going for the w are we going for the simple one are we
okay
yeah

mm
i suppose we need we need to find out what circuit board that requires maybe before we m make a decision
oh yeah i suppose so yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah
just
just just for the call and find thing
'cause it's s it's separate isn't it it's not part of the
mm hmm
yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah and ours is quite a cheap device so i don't know how much we'll be able to put into it
yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
okay
i've i've got some things to say about possible design things from
trend watching
cool
right um i've been looking at some trends
in in sort of basically fashion on top of doing the um research
into the remote control market the the one that's the one i talked about last time that we'd sort of asked
people about remote controls and what what was good about them what was bad what they used and we've also
been looking at sort of fa sort of fashions and what people are wanting out of consumer goods at the moment
so we've had people in paris and milan watching the uh fashion trends
so
so just to summarise the most important things which came out of the remote control market investigation
the most important thing was that the thing sort of look and felt fancy rather than just functional and
second there should be some technological innovation and then third and l less important
than the other two there should be an ease of use as well
and apparently the fashion trends are that people want sort of clothes and shoes
and things with a fruit and vegetables theme um but
um the feel of the material should be spongy which is contrary to last year apparently i presume it must have been not
not spongy last year so
we need to emphasise the fancy design with on on our remote control above
all else and then also try and add in technological informat innovation which could be our sort of find the thing
with a hand clap and then we need to ma sort of make it easy to use that's as a third priority
so perhaps um fewer fewer buttons and functions as we've as we've discussed and then
maybe find a way to incorporate these trends so that we sort of capture people's imaginations
so maybe we could make the buttons shaped like fruit and veg or the the buttons could be spongy
uh somehow maybe we could make them out of rubber rather than sort of hard plastic and then sort of
even wackier than that we could maybe have a fruit or vegetable shaped remote say in the shape of a banana or something
like that
right so that'll be it maybe a banana or courgette or something
how how far we actually want to go along and sort of follow the trends do we think the trends are particularly important for this type of gadget or or you know do they not matter that much
yeah
maybe yeah
mm hmm
yeah yeah
mm hmm
yeah i'm not
yeah
i'm not i'm not sure what what what the sort of timescale we're thinking of selling the product over is i don't know
yeah yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah
yeah
yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah
okay
yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
that's possibly it
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah
yeah i mean it's people say that it's the look they want the fancy looking thing but i'm
yeah i'm not convinced on whether having changeable covers would be something that people would buy into i think with the mobiles
it's the you know it's a communication device people see you with it all about and
i if it
yeah
i think
mm hmm
well it was different last year the trend was different last year apparently it was not not spongy feel
but
i don't know whether the trend will change i don't know whether it's one of those things that
like sort of having all fruit shaped keys that that probably would go out of fashion very quickly whereas just the fact that it was a rubber case is probably less less of something that
y you're gonna end up hating in a year you know
yeah
mm
okay


when you say d when you say double curved what what exactly does that mean
okay
no you're not connected to me anymore

that should come up
mm
mm hmm
yeah
right
that's what i was trying to work out
shall we
yeah
okay
yeah i think that think that's a good idea
rubber
rubber buttons and case
yeah
yeah yeah
okay and then are we going for sort of one button shaped like a fruit or veg
don't know maybe just
yeah
that's ru rubber buttons yeah
yeah reasonably spongy i guess yeah
yeah okay

yeah
apple
yeah
yeah apple apple a a qu quite a big one as well a big apple uh
could be a red apple yeah
either don't mind
mm hmm
mm hmm
okay

looks like it
right
'kay
yeah
yeah mm
yeah
mm
yeah
he has had it certainly yeah yeah he's been emailed it while ago
now he's gone
oh really
excellent
we should have these things in our area you know we don't have high tech things well i guess there's telescopes but that that's that's different though isn't it that's not no

yeah that's right although you oh it isn't actually used all that often these days i think
gosh
right aye
right gosh
and you miss all the the body language and things yeah yeah
right
right
right

right
right
oh right gosh
yeah
yeah
that's very artificial though isn't it yeah not very sensible yeah right
yeah
that must be really weird is there gosh
yeah gosh well mm hmm
great
do you think sorry i i shouldn't intervene probably but well the um isn't it that if um it's a region of the spectrum that's u
and we can point at it and then it is a sp a sp spectral f f
feature and that isn't
you think
okay alright okay okay okay

yeah

yeah
i think it's a feature um because in the s sp spectrum it does that and it does that so it yeah that's that is where it breaks so yeah
oh you want to s split that one and do you into two yeah yeah uh i'd agree with that i think
yeah
thanks
but if it had been there um you would've
had it as a feature
yeah because you haven't actually listed explicitly um that you're not going to include it
l line ratio is after abundances
so
oh i see what you mean um
well
no
yeah

um
well i mean you could look at this this spectrum and spot that um th l lyman alpha has been damped 
that is a n spectral feature
oh yeah no that's true

different redshifts yeah yeah yeah that's true
yeah but
but you're guessing in a way though aren't you so
mm that's a that's a tricky one certain certainly
wouldn't you
wouldn't you have all of it
right well th yeah th that's in the the manual so
i g i guess it is
i
and that it is altering the spectrum isn't it i mean is a ch
change in the s spectrum of
background objects
uh is that right
yeah
no
yeah i think so too in that
m
that's actually an ionic species isn't it actually not a a spectral feature as such o on its own
no
b b why aren't you marking it then
uh huh
well that's p what i'm p pondering really um
yeah but this is um species of cloud it's a p
a particular species of cloud not just a general cloud isn't it so isn't that different
okay th
then i guess not then yeah
and
but it's in this s sp sp sp sp spectrum of another object though it it isn't the spectrum of the clouds yeah
that is true uh and he could point at it that's true and say that is
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah yeah
yeah
yeah
uh yeah
i'm not sure actually i th i think i would mark it
and
and that it
it is a region of the spectrum and they're actually using a region of the spectrum
as the data um
but if you both want not to mark it then fine don't mark it
mm
right
you have to s speed up we'll go p could be here all day
well i y
yeah i don't think you can
yeah uh i don't think that's a feature
really it's a process isn't it

well
isn't that a process
it's a process isn't it
well it i wouldn't
have any of it i think i think all of that is um just that is process
isn't it
yeah
you think
um
you don't think that it

actually is abundance really in a way
i'm not sure but
i'm not sure yeah
yeah that's right
uh i
well but it
isn't this an elemental um abundance

that you estimate actually using a number of lines is it it isn't just one discrete
line in the spectrum is it b
i'm not sure
well if you t
two is an ionic species and it'll have a number of

lines in the spectrum and you'll uh estimate
on the abundance all of the s species actually use the old lines
they haven't been if it's yeah
i think so yeah
oh well what's new
okay well then have it in yeah yeah okay
what does that mean
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
sorry what's the i can't see

right

yeah
yeah
i wouldn't i think now probably
well h  l  was a line there really isn't it so
yeah
yeah i think so
yeah exactly that yeah exactly that

yep
technique yeah the network is an instrument though isn't it
it
it's e v n  isn't it
well it
isn't all of
this is an instrument if you have it all isn't it
i think so
yeah
but um
which it is uh i think
that's what i think
oh i think it's uh um s s s starting with um eu european i think
uh yes
just in europe
but it's actually merlin and all the i um international logs in europe all
hooked up into one instrument basically yeah
yeah
yeah
hmm
did you i thought it was a process and that it it wasn't included
yeah
yeah
really
well i would argue about that you see because i think that i mean th that you only extract that after you actually model a sp spectrum don't you
yeah but have a component though as such
yeah g um c
yeah that's that's what i'm thinking that
it's actually really um after you actually model the s a spectrum not just actually looking at the spectrum yeah you think
y
yeah
yeah but um component it is m means it's an element actually in the model though
well uh
the excesses yeah but um the component isn't
i think i would yeah
yes yeah yeah
i
i think actually pretty early on i'd have thought
where are they
uh only just
i
interesting because on the hour it yeah
no
no it is yeah
well people do though don't they i mean it's pretty s stupid but they do
yeah i think so
yeah
if you're having ultra loom this early on then i think you have to have here
i don't think so
but t y are you arguing not to have anything with object in it though
so there goes

and you s speed it up as well i think so
and something to fidget with
okay
see
on your marks get set go
such a long time since i've done these
at the beginning we did um
we did a training set didn't we and then compared to see
we probably did
and supposedly decided on things and then we did th all the rest of them separately
yes i think okay yeah but you convinced me
no that's true mm hmm
it's the length of it really
but we had
that's really hard yeah
mm hmm
no
yeah
and we we had a manual which we haven't got here do you reckon if we get a copy would that be useful
are we allowed to leave the meeting now it's started
can we get ben to print us out one
mm okay yes now we're moving with the headphones

yes he's he's been e emailed it yeah otherwise we can go onto our system and get it
yes let's say something rude
i oh top
but no how little work we did
i'm doing that at yes
yeah they have got a
conference thing haven't they
in the a t c 
i had to fly to germany to do a teleconference the same as you did for the interview and they fly you to germany and
put you on a four way teleconference with three people in chile and had they asked we could have done it fine at a t c 
and saved me having to to go to germany for a day but
they haven't got that far
mm

and mine was even it was different again w we had it was a four way split screen with me and three other people
and it just stayed like that and i had the talk on a laptop in front of me and they had the talk on their laptops and i had to tell tell
them when to press the button to turn the page it just
yes if you see towards the top left of the image you'll notice and luckily olivia had warned me it might be
complicated and so i had something with without very many um n not little flying in and things
because that would just make it really difficult but i practised the talk yeah standing up in front of it and pointing to things and
you're sitting down in front of and you could see yourself but not only could s you see yourself you see yourself bounce back two seconds later
by the time the signal had gone to chile and back so you're like oh did i just do that and then you reacting to what you did a while ago it was a really daft situation
lovely
and then we can start fighting about
yes let's
continuum flux or continuum
mm yes
flux on its own wouldn't be a spectral feature i think it should probably just be continuum
if it was continuum luminosity you probably wouldn't it ooh

okay it's my part
oh
i think i think we've worked

yes and i'm pretty sure i'm bottom anyway so even on one we can tell
'cause i would fight for line being a spectral feature as well
it's a bit hard to mark on this let's do that
the ones we want
yes and if neither then we'll have to put something else
and i think you're probably right soft component is a spectral feature
ooh well if you don't no yeah go ahead
mm hmm
pi
you can point to a soft component
yeah
is it

uh now is a feature part of spectral feature
i think you're right there as well
'cause it it's not just absorption but it's not just absorption point five k v  it is actually something in the absorption that you're seeing
if it was a
a dip in absorption or a
a lack of absorption you would put it in because we said we would put describing words
mm hmm
you would get a pencil
that's two
ah there's one with the equivalent width i think you're right that we we weren't gonna mark the equivalent width but we were gonna mark the lines
broad line and that should be a and nebulae
as a source type
i can't remember should we see when the manual comes so let's come back to that one um
yep


i what we're doing about that either
select a
yeah that seems reasonable

yes um
breaking the power law index i think that's probably a you can point to it but equally it's not a it's something you've derived
so what's a breaking a power law index
mm hmm yep
okay
slight depression of the continuum near the lyman limit i think you're right there as well
but we're supposed to say w
yeah i if it was absorption at h  alpha that would all be one or absorption at five thousand nanometres would all be one anyway
because it was at a certain point
but this is near
yeah i think you're right it's it's near rather than at it's not

let's mark that then
yes
is that k  clear oh
mm absorption
yes and you're right there as well
tell you who's more awake at this
mm hmm an absorption feature

thank you
there is no steep soft component but our two k v 
mm
yes you could i tend to miss out things if they're too long
um
you would point to it yeah yes i think you're right
should we go back to number five
but yes nebula mm hmm

i think it does we weren't matching a h  two regions because it was a region i think was the argument for that
line again line in ratios but i remember we weren't gonna mark line ratios but we were going to mark 'cau we're here where you've got equivalent width of h  beta orbited
ratio is different i guess mm
i guess it's similar
don't include
is that the value or is that the word
don't it in include the derived property
you wouldn't include line in that okay
the one to keep yeah
damped lyman alpha absorbers i think that's a spectral feature even though it's
you wouldn't mark the source type
here
yes because we don't want it underlined it shouldn't be highlighted so yeah m
mm hmm but it's also a i i if we have
but th but you also absorb them by y you observe them by their spectral feature what were we doing for things broad absorption line quasar for example we were marking the broad absorption line as well as broad absorption line quasar
so i think it should be the same as that if it's defined by a spectral feature we should mark it
here
you could point to damped lyman alpha though
because it says here spectral features we're now referring to a type of source e g  quasar
um not a bis specific type of source but i think still the the spectral feature ge counts even though it's m a modifier of something
what do you reckon bob
how does it work i don't know what which doesn't help
mm hmm
y ye
but that doesn't mean that it's you could still say that's damped lyman alpha and that's damped lyman alpha
you could say all of that is damped lyman alpha
but isn't that j always the case with something that's not particularly
mm hmm
it it if it was if it was some other spectral feature and then absorbers
would we mark it
but
but we include modifiers of source types we would mark we're not marking absorbers but if it was a damped lyman alpha quasar
then we would mark quasar and we would mark damped lyman alpha if it was broad absorption line quasar we'd mark it yeah so it's just i guess whether damped lyman alpha is a spectral feature
in itself which i would probably say it was but then i've never looked at i one


mm hmm
it doesn't have to be something that's specific i guess y you know we we say a uh big blue bump or a soft or a continuum and we include those
that true but w we have included c power law though well no we included p steep soft component sorry and here we included breaking the power law because of the break
mm hmm but there's still some degree of fitting and it's steep you're saying you know what's steep and what's shallow
let's have that for now then you if if we change our mind later when we go through we can always come back to it and say
yeah you're right
and absorption again
right what have we got different here
hmm it's
yeah it's that one and this one here oh we were including feature within spectral feature
okay
i think i just missed it i think it's not as if it's a although it's four widths half maximum it's still the s the line within it
silicone two is an element rather than a
in this context
rather than a line these are the lines
i guess what you w
if wasn't in there then you'd have it silicone two lines at but without with the i think that means silicone two derived from these two features
okay
mm


lyman alpha forest clouds
lyman alpha forest you can point to on the spectrum
so we haven't basically we just haven't got a a rule for
spectral features within or referring to s types of source when we're not bother marking the source
so are we marking h  two and h  two regions for example
oh that's true but b yeah but i guess it's not it's not defined by a spectral feature though h  two region whereas
lyman alpha forest is defined by the definition of lyman alpha forest clouds is that they have lyman alpha forests
but someone's l someone's looked at that spectrum
i don't think we were making diffuse diffuse emission or
um
hmm
mm
it's a modifier of of clouds but i don't th don't think if we're including the
i think if we're not including nebula and clouds we can't include
perhaps we should've done
but we haven't done for the whole thing so i think maybe we just need to put under don't include diffuse emission
but then we still have to decide if we don't label the source what do we do about the spectral features that define that source
i if we have for example broad absorption line object we mark that we mark broad absorption line in that
it's an but just to know this is a lyman alpha forest cloud we're seen lyman alpha forest
but it's still a spectral feature even if it's not it might be a spectral feature i not in the cloud but it a spectral feature in the quasar the lyman alpha forest
okay even if not marked
no one else can read that sorry okay so th lyman alpha forest again
and that definitely is a spectral feature on its own then 'cause it doesn't even say lyman alpha forest clouds
each helium two optical depth i think that's elemental species
oh oh we marked the same lines
what have we done differently
'cause the property of the line they're gonna we're gonna have a lot of these and we weren't using line
what was the one we didn't do before line ratio we weren't doing
was talking about l lines okay
line feature need that

there's only one difference here
no no they are the same otherwise quite impressively that one's the same
and damped lyman alpha data
i can't even but if you said
if you said the spectral dat
the continuum's spet mm
but if it's a damped lyman alpha spectrum you'd mark damped lyman alpha because in the spectrum and and a da is equivalent of spectrum

that's because it was talking about s but if it's saying silicone two line
levels the new word

i think you're probably right in the case of it being data
mm
well
if it's an emission line data
mm if it's an emission line data would we put it in
but if it just said em but if it just said emission line we would
it the emission line is strong the emission line data shows strong
then uh i think it's the same actually i th i think it's data isn't even needed
it's inconsistent with the damped lyman alpha at more than the ninety nine percent or the damped lyman alpha feature if you put feature there rather than data then you'd mark it but i think data is equivalent if
yeah
okay that's think enough
given that we can argue about it for ten minutes it's probably not that clear cut
damped lyman alpha systems and uh it shouldn't be either of them it should be damped lyman alpha
in red whatever that is spectral feature
and that shouldn't be there at all
and i've done it twice
is that clear enough
flat spectrum
we were including modifiers including broad line quasars non broad line quasars as well so i think we should probably include the flat spectrum with your q with your quasar is a very different from steep spectrum
we're ten percent of the way there

continua
oh gosh it will be here forever remarkably soft ionising continua
you're right though i think or or continuum
the absorbed continuum mm hmm yes
oxygen shouldn't be there that's not observed
heavy element absorption lines i think should be there
now what else is different
mm oh thank you and that one

you're right star forming galaxies are distinct
that's yeah derived probably because you were doing seven thousand of these an hour
you mean that
if it was lines from h  two you'd mark it
blue wing flux what were we gonna do about flux
doesn't say
yes it's the amount of stuff in the blue wing so i'm happy with that
line peak
i think that should be marked even though it's talking about increasing line peak it's also talking about increasing excess blue wing
should actually be excess blue wing flux
anyway
i think line peak is something you can point to
no but you can't you can't s also point to increa increasing blue wing
what
mm
okay

light
ye yes

right neutral hydrogen gunn petersen absorption
i think all of that's a spectral
feature
it's basically a way of saying the gunn petersen t it's a way of saying the gunn petersen trough though
which if you just said that it's gunn petersen absorption from neutral hydrogen rather than
i if it was a t if it was hydrogen absorption you'd mark the whole thing if it was hydrogen align you would so you should mark if it was
or h  beta absorption it's a marks the kind of spectral feature doesn't it
but so is h  beta absorp uh emission as a process from h  beta but it's still this is a process from neutral hydrogen
i guess what i'm meaning is neutral hydrogen should be in there and the fact that gunn peterson comes between it
is just a pain
mm
mm hmm
okay let's just cross everything out
blue shifted absorption
i think it's a modifier of the thing and so it probably should be there
as in we're putting weak and strong absorption would count so i think blue shifted should um
that's talking about the line isn't it
so that should be in
yeah that's talking about uh
strength rather than
it's not the uh abundance of it or any derived property it's just the strength of the lines
i guess perhaps it is
um let's make a decision
i guess it could be abundance
yes that's true i think you probably should then 'cause we will put in our align strength uh if it's a f  i of a two line strength we would definitely put it in
and i think that's what it's referring to even though it's not
it's not saying
two
its lines
it's an abundance i it's an element i guess but it's
but it's a strength rather than abundance i think that's still looking at the amount of flux coming out of the out of all the f e  two lines rather than
in general we haven't if unless it's specifically saying it's a line but i guess the question is just as specifically referred to a line and i maybe it's not clear enough to mark
let's not mark it then
well line narrow line if it says it f e  two line strength then we would mark it 'cause you're talking about the line of it rather than the ev element
the word line should be in there or
yeah i think they mean l
i think they mean the line strength rather than the f e  two abundance i think that's what they probably mean but it's just not very clear
b s  bloated star that's a
yeah
um take out line
and that's just the wrong
that's just the wrong colour as is that
i think you were right there
yep you're right
and you're right there as well that's a physical process
yes that was one i wasn't sure about 'cause infrared and if it was mid infrar uh if it was you'd put it in
that's just the wrong na that's just this should be a source name
i don't know w
yes i guess the problem is due to what does that m mean i presumed it
is it okay right 'cause that's one i just didn't know what it
uh i thought it was a catalogue
mm
h  alpha i think should be marked yeah
yeah you're still detecting a line even if you're detecting it from broad band filters
um
broad band
broad line region you are right
and now align nebulae okay we'll just go back and change those you're right
okay where was it started here um
why did it so we mark
um we have got nebulae marked here
oh yeah okay modifiers with them which is give a yell if you see one
so damped lyman alpha absorbers shouldn't be in there
but then i'm i i p i probably use that rule so half the time and just forgotten to use at other times
mm
yeah
yes i i'm sure i've followed that rule sometimes and just forgotten so let's take that out um
lyman alpha forest here
but lyman alpha forest should be in here because it's not talking about uh m it's not modified
damped lyman alpha data

data i think we should keep in
because it's would be the same as feature
or spec spectrum i think data's the same as spectrum 'cause the data is a spec m
final view bob
okay
mm let's take that out

and this one comes out as well
okay so we want nothing
there
didn't it
yeah
right
we're there right
h  alpha detection
but i wouldn't is h  alpha broad brand it's a line
whether you detect it

h  alpha emitters are not
a distinct class of source i don't think
line
mm hmm
but i guess if you're picking out a spectral feature even with a broad band or narrow band then it's still a spectral feat feature
if you're picking out a line what however you pick it out
line on its own
i think there's gonna be a lot of those which makes life simpler
yep
absorption profiles i think that i think the whole thing should actually be marked
even this complex how far should we go
comple just absorption per
um
lyman alpha forest line blanketing or lyman alpha forest line
is it a system
v l b a  is an instrument oh is it

is a network but is it
yes
v 
v l  b very long baseline array v l b a  if it had an a  on the end it would be the ne instrument
yes 'cause it ta it takes an image so oh but then a m research group could take an image okay let's oh how much of modifiers are we putting in
from one point six or from european
or just um v l b a 
he's using capitals but s
okay
uh huh
okay

that's just broad band isn't it broad line emission
so that shouldn't be marked
radio loud objects it's not ve it's not a m mod it's not an original system m
anything ending in object we don't include yep
so none of those
yep
now we've both marked line ratios here
and that's the same
continuum
and there it's different because you're talking about the ionizing continuum which is a pre
yeah
i think you can point to line pairs
and that shouldn't be in there
yep scribble away
you're right there that's all one big spectral feature
and nebula shouldn't be marked
what do we do back here
what did we do back here we did mark nebula yes
it was things that weren't distinct like yeah
mm hmm yeah it's a difficult one but if we're gonna stick to it let's stick to it

the the
and i think we need the i think we would put stop putting the in we could get confused and you're right there
oh yeah
line blanketing you think y
we had line blanketing just now and we included it i think we sh um

where was it
don't think n lyman f forest line blanket we took blanketing out
and that's all the same
yes yes it is
red and blue components
i think you're right there as well
yeah i think i in the same way that you can point to
the soft x  rays or or the hard x  rays you can point to the red and the
hmm
but we're talking about the c the continuum though if you have a galaxy spectrum though you can say there's the blue component there's the red component to the spectrum oh i see what you mean i like it comes from adding two different things together
i can see that yeah
yes
but if it said red or blue excess rather than red or blue component i guess the problem with
mm hmm okay
let's
if you modelled it with two parts one that had a a ha a harder and softer spectrum hubble in hubble deep field south
i didn't include it although it does apply to the telescope but mm
let's keep it in

anyone remember when
let's start at the beginning
oh excellent
um
hubble

no wait the top one i think you should include
possibly with flux as well though
and then yes the whole thing

well i said radio galaxies now what did we p we say about acronyms where part of it was useful um

um
but i don't think we should mark high red shift in that they are just red shi but yes wh what did we say about acronyms where
yes i think you are

seyfert one point eight and one point nine galaxies
you wouldn't say we're talking about yes

i think they probably are
inseparate and it's just the and that annoys
mission line feature we're gonna include

galaxy when it's a process yes
ah now this is one
where it should be this one but what if you'd un if these are doubly underlined has it just plotted the top colour
yes
okay because what we want here let's just mark what we want and mark that but with also broad line
i can't write
we changed it so that you could yeah because quite often uh an object class is defined by a spectral feature
like broad line radio galaxies
broader lines i think

list the wrong wrong colour for a few things oh it's all here hyper luminous galaxy
mm hmm
this is just a colour issue
ye
yeah they should all be and that one
i s m  it's diffuse

so it probably shouldn't be in there
oh no
what we doing about nebula again i've forgotten
okay yeah
features
flat spectrum radio quasars

strong drop in the continuum i think you're right there
i think you're right again that's just the place
um we're not doing emission line when it's a modifier of objects are we
the question is are emission line objects a separate class of source i think they are
yes you're right
and seyfert galaxies w should be one you're right there

i got three seventy
right
we did yeah
yeah we did two of those didn't we
i think we did two training sets and then we had at least one meeting with you where we talked it all through

yes
yeah
i'd say no but i d i mean i thought we had basically the same ideas to b i don't remember ever having strong arguments about what should be in what group or it was just the rules about things that s yeah
and what counted as wha as for the spectral features it was more confusing what counted as a spectral
feature and we had a long discussion about that but i don't remember sort of arguing from different sides and converging just sort of
piecing out what would come up and agreeing what we'd do
it probably would be but i don't i it's been a long time yeah since we've done this
yeah that would be handy sign off
we did send it to him yeah
yeah

there's a cool little count down clock that lets you know exactly how long you've been meeting as well
no we don't at all
yeah but they're hardly in our areas uh
yeah i did as well
no
it's a very strange interview feeling as well because you can't see them while you're giving
your talk because they just show usually they have a camera on you and a camera on them but during the talk part
they have a camera on i believe them 'cause i could see that guy reading a newspaper halfway through my talk and then they
had a camera on showing what my slides were and so you forget that they can see you at all
and so when all that was over they were answering me questions and the view switched again i realised they were sitting there in the interview going
so
yeah
and you can't say looking over here like o
yeah
yeah it is really strange
mm
excellent
right shall w shall we dive in in the interim or

mm
no you wouldn't do i think i'm do i think i'm working out who's top and bottom um
yeah i'm happy enough with that i don't feel strongly about it
ah ben said he he left it out on purpose which is reason
yeah i'm pretty sure i'm top uh
right
right yeah i think that's probably right as well
okay next
okay so here we're missing soft component on the bottom

there
if you get line i get soft component
yeah
you can point to a soft component
yeah
it's a big bump in the soft bit
it c uh yeah i'm not fussed about that they both mean the same thing
yeah this is the this is the thing you point to yep yeah that's the thing you point to and this is a ph a physical mechanism so yeah i'd say
two down two hundred and fifteen to go excellent
mm that's definitely two you're right
i think that's true
alrighty
what are we missing broad line yeah that's true you get that
uh
i don't remember what we were doing with nebulae
we weren't doing like h  two regions and stuff were we
i can't remember actually
yeah yeah
yes
mm we were doing descriptions that made things separate classes in which case i'd argue for elliptical i think
my god i've just gone mad with the underlining here
yeah i
yeah that's the thing but you wouldn't know it was a p yeah
the parallel index is something you desi derive a break in a spectrum is something you can point at so
yeah b that thing there
and if i did it again i'd say a slight depression of the continuum and possibly well 'cause you can see both the slight depression and the lyman limit but we're supposed to say the descriptive words of the features so
mm hmm
yeah but they would be the same they'd both be the same spectral feature whereas here they're two spectral features there's a lyman limit which you could see and then there's a slight depression near it but
yeah
do you have a sense about that
yeah
excellent
yeah okay
uh huh
that i didn't mark because it's the physical process of absorption
not the the thing
yeah if it was there's an absorption feature or absorption to see it the spectrum at this wave length
but when you say for example the the quasar is absorbed that just means the quasar is behind a a bunch of stuff
so that's describing something physically rather than describing the spectrum itself
so
thank you
i don't remember what we were gonna do about things that weren't there
it's not something you can point to
you could point to it if it were there
marked it yeah
yeah
huh oh yeah yeah what were we saying about nebula source types

no nebula counts doesn't it
right
yeah
yeah but that's line ratios
but
uh line in in line in line ratios is modifying ratios it isn't it it's it's not talking about specific lines a line ratio is a thing
right
yeah
yeah
yeah yeah i mean you wouldn't you wouldn't include abundances or line strengths yeah it shouldn't be in
i don't think whoop no oh i see what you're doing you're circling the one we like right
oh sorry um yep
uh right damped lyman see again that's uh these are source types the um i mean it's not a source type b
but damped lyman alpha absorbers are th are physical things not spectral features
ye
but uh you wouldn't be able to point something in a spectrum and say that's a damped lyman alpha absorber unless you'd
yeah you could do
but we wouldn't say absorbers were a type of source
okay i'm not certain about that but i
hmm
but
d don't with damped lyman alpha observers you them a variety of places along the line of sight so you have to know
if you look at a quasar and you see a bunch uh if you got a bunch of clouds of gas in the way you can see these things and but you wouldn't be able to point at one of them and say ah that's a damp yeah they're gonna be at different red shifts
i don't know how they do th that but
yeah
ye
well no but you see them in all sorts of different red red shifts it's like the the lyman alpha forest sort of
and i'm not certain i would
i would mark that
it's a tricky one
um no i wouldn't because it's they're physical things not spectral features you can't point at something on a spectrum and say that's definitely a d damped lyman alpha some i g and i guess it's because they're modifiers of this source type and we wouldn't mark that source type
we wouldn't mark absorbers no
yeah
yeah
hmm it's tricky one
okay
okay
but we weren't going to include s descriptions of spectral features that were based on fitting were we
have we
steep soft component yeah breaking the power law is something i'm not certain of steep soft component is something you can point at in a spectrum and say there it is yeah yeah
it's tricky
yeah that's grand yeah yes

um again i'd say this this is a physical process not a spectral feature
uh
yeah

uh i don't have k  star but i should do
wait where
okay
what's wrong with broad h  alpha
right
yeah
okay
yeah
yeah that's true yeah
yeah that's true
oh no we're back to it again
that's true but lyman alpha forest clouds are source types we aren't marching marking
which we don't mark yeah
but we can just be consistent
and i don't think we are 'cause that's not a spectral feature in the spectrum we're looking at yeah
but saying that isn't the same as saying we've seen that in a spectrum whereas a broad line quasar someone has looked at it and they've seen a broad line
but if you're discussing lyman alpha forest clouds they could just be discussing the physical object which we aren't marking
because they weren't i don't know
anything blobby i di i didn't mark yeah
yeah
i w i remembered not marking nebula or clouds or
yeah
mm
yeah
i think we just have to decide whether we're doing it
yeah but bob's saying maybe we should be uh including nebula and clouds
but we haven't for the whole thing
yeah
but that's 'cause we've to know it's a rather broad absorp absorption line object we have seen it
uh
yeah
yeah let's keep them
nope and here
yep
mm hmm

there that's derived you're right

oh rubbish excellent
uh you've got line brightness temperatures
yeah yeah we are
yeah i don't think line brightness temperatures counts
'cause it's not talking about a specific line
so yeah
i don't think that counts

feature right
mm hmm
oh no yeah they're all the same
yes excellent um damped lyman alpha again
systems
that's a modifier of data
i mean that's that's a description of the type of data a d
i really don't think that counts
i wouldn't but you would
i think just because it's got a spectral feature in the phrase you wouldn't for example when we were saying silicone two levels we didn't mark silicone two
that's that's got nothing to do with the spectrum
but what this actually means is we've made some measurements based on damped lyman alpha measurements and they tell us this answer and this answer is inconsistent with that answer yeah i don't think that's right
hmm
m
i wouldn't but because it's a modifier of data

oh feature absolutely b but
mm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah
okay
yeah
alright
take it again but systems should be out yeah
mm 'kay you've done it again
yes

right source type
did we have a rule about this
mm hmm
yep that's true that is true
are we excellent
just hitting the half an hour mark

see that i that's talking about the the flux of kin of ionising photons rather then the continuum of that spectrum so i don't like that one

oxygen abundance yeah
mm
i'm happy enough with that
blue shifted that's okay with me i don't care
yeah you can have that as well
there you go
next
uh
i think they are
i don't know why i did that i don't like that at all

yeah could be that i was a bit sleepy lines from ions

you can't tell the difference between a line from an ion and a line line from something else
well you'd know where they are in the
well i guess yeah i dunno yeah yeah yeah that's true
that's true alright

yeah but the feature itself is blue wing flux or if it was said blue wing feature we'd mark feature hmm
yeah



possibly don't know

ah uh
you can point to it but can you point to a line peak velocity shift
well you can point to blue wing flux 'cause you have your line and there's the blue wing flux but if the line peak is increasingly shifted you'd
mm there's a system issue again so we should be consistent and keep it right

yeah
mm
mm

i think i might agree with you
'cause this definitely shouldn't be marked
because that is a process not a
a
and if that shouldn't be marked then that shouldn't be marked
right
oh okay mm
yeah
hmm yes okay
yeah i'm not sure either but um
b oh yeah either that if that shouldn't be in neither should either of those
mm yeah
a feature
what do you mean
is it
uh
we've marked thing have we marked things like
yeah i don't know if we've marked things like silicone one
throughout
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah if we don't mark it though we definitely shouldn't mark these two should we
do you agree with that
if that's true then their leaving out the word line i don't should mean that it shouldn't be marked but
but i mean we know what they mean like
yeah let's leave it in
next
uh
oh is that what that means
oh yeah
okay
mm hmm
seyfert two oh yep
you're right
radio loud counts yeah
yeah
yeah
okay
that counts
yeah yeah
yeah the and this shouldn't be should it
m m does those count as modifiers active we definitely include active
so
it's a k kind of elliptical is it
a e  two is a kind of elliptical what i don't know what the j  means

those can does that not mean a a broad band detection
and does that count
uh h  alpha detection
but don't we say we don't do that
ah i'm right look don't include modifiers of regions or systems e g 
region systems that's why i wasn't doing it
g ah look at that

yeah but b uh modifiers of regions or systems is the
yeah we could always change this if we think we're right rather than going back through and
based on this but we could change this rule rather than changing all those things what's the what was the appropriate thing to do at this point

right
right right yep
'cause you might have followed that rule right
alright
um
yeah
yeah that's fine
damped lyman alpha systems
ah we're back to damped lyman alpha data
okay
i
i do i still don't think that goes in but
yeah i still don't like it but
i don't have passionate feelings

yep
yeah just cross those out





oops
excellent so what were we looking at this page for anyway it was for something else h  alpha detection
uh
broad band detections is in don't include
oh so it would be a narrow band detection a narrow band imaging detection alright good
no they aren't
yeah
yeah okay

okay yeah
right
uh this is another systems thing
okay
yeah
no
um
yeah absorption profiles i'll go for why not
yeah take out the blanketing
has this
ah right
yep
yeah v l b i  is uh a net uh it's it's a v l b i  is it's a technique it's not a yeah
what's it's called something else isn't it the v o 
yeah it's called a v l b a 
this is
v l b i  network image so do they mean the v l b a 
european v l b i  net is it in it it's an intstru group instrument not a research group
yeah
yeah
it's only supposed to be proper names but i don't
yeah is that so this whole thing is an instrument you say
oh
oh i see i see yeah
so is this like it's a subset of the v l b a 

right
cool
right
oh
that is a source name you're right
yeah that's just
mm hmm we say something about objects and i think it's that we don't use it
ye

yeah but we shouldn't have done
so that's it yeah

yeah that's fair enough it's certainly not a source name
yeah that means that's a proc it's a process or it's a it's a type of photons that's not the continuum you're looking at

sure you can yep

mm nope
neither should that
excellent

have we agreed on that
we only agreed that so far we've only agreed that we can't include spectral features modifying nebula but i don't see yet where it's written down that you can't mark nebula yeah
yeah but the see there's so many different kinds of nebula i think is why i wasn't doing it
yeah if we're going to have them let's have them
what's different
oh yeah um don't mind
mm hmm
you're right
there
source type
line blanketing
sh i no i don't think i did i
so that yeah did we
ah

um
we did just have it don't know it wasn't that far back was it no it wasn't that far back
line yeah we took blanketing out so i don't think that should be in

is that it yeah
uh that's a source nine
isn't it
yeah
mm
yeah yeah i think i'm right

oh yeah
yeah
mm the soft excess you can definitely point to on an x  ray thing you kn you know if there's one there or not you could say that's that so
you're saying you wouldn't know it was soft unless you'd
w oh yeah i see what
mm
but results from spectral
give that for red and blue components but i wouldn't probably give that for soft component because a soft excess is a uh i mean that's an x  ray thing like a break you say oh look there's
mm yeah yeah i'd take out red and blue
which means maybe we should take out soft but it's such a basic sort of you look at a spectrum and you say that's a a soft excess it's a soft
yeah it's just a t
yeah yeah yeah

that's probably true yeah
um hubble and hubble deep sent to us
yeah
yeah
so should w did we have a soft component earlier so we sh should kill it
no
yeah
there it is
right
alright
mm d yeah okay
yeah that's fine i'm happy with all that
yeah
yeah that counts
do we ha did we s make a decision about radio galaxies 'cause i think
they are discussed as a separate source type aren't they
radio galaxies
it hides that yeah yeah you're right
yeah
yeah
where part of it's useful i think you're supposed to mark the whole thing aren't you yeah so you're right

um

it's a sub classification of seyfert's would make a s study seyfert one point eights oh do they

you're right yeah
yeah that's fine
uh yep
yeah galaxy and galaxy formation doesn't count
and yes that counts
but in
yeah
right but i'm on the
yeah

mm
yeah
mm hmm
yeah i don't think that should go in

don't mind oh up here
yeah
mm
is it or is it oh right and q s o  is not yeah you're right
yep


the i s m  isn't a source type is it
we're now including nebula aren't we
mm what have we done features
mm yep

okay
nope
yep
we aren't doing emission line objects
oh no we aren't doing that either you're right
mm no they aren't are they
yeah

yeah anything to do with objects so nothing
yeah
yes
hmm
did did you guys actually had sort of um the interaction or discussions while you we doing the annotation did you have had stages of clarification or i suppose you did right mm hmm
mm hmm
so did you feel that it was some some kind of some process of convergence like that initially had quite different ideas about the phrase types and and markations and then eventually you came up uh with some kind of rules that you set up between uh the two of you or
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah i think so okay i dropped a so did dere derek and ben has the um the file that they this manual or
yeah o okay
okay right it's printing it out as well
i actually haven't really thought about like uh marking or not marking who's top and who's bottom i think maybe that would make sense for you guys to know i don't know

yeah
okay fair enough
so so you sorry um just for the convention you you you marking which uh which the annotation you think is is the right one okay fair enough

mm hmm okay




would there be other cases where you would actually mark an ab absorption or
mm hmm
mm hmm
cheers yeah
mm hmm mm hmm okay
is that the nebula
was it the nebula thin yeah
um so so can i just ask w w now you just uh aligned d uh sorry you circle the word in the in the outline which didn't
right sorry ok oh i see okay mm hmm
cheers i see
that was easy

the the
i it it wouldn't count as a source type or
yeah yeah
mm hmm
hmm
um sorry can we just go back th uh one page did did you resolve the the li the different um segmentations like uh the main problem was
oh sorry i i thought it was a problem of like uh one having underlined the entire oh sorry no no i i se okay sorry yeah i see
so from the perspective the named entity recognition task so i th i think th there there was also this one guideline of saying for example if something
uh is sitting under a negation right the there was no um damped l  y  alpha something then um
we then i think the convention was that we still that you still would mark that right so it's more like uh a s it's uh uh
it's uh sort of like a quite literal task that's really like finding these kind of uh these types of strings uh rather than
really referring to the underlying physical reality which i mean sort of like if if you if you were to resolve these kind of
uh cases in order to put them say in a database or so then you'd probably be right in this case right but uh th given that the kind
of thing is that that this named entity recogn task is is a much is a much more uh literal thing like really just fin finding these kind
of strings i think in this case um i w i would say this is probably an entity yeah




um so uh just about changing rules i mean in a sense you also want to make sure that the annotation that that they the agreements
that you arrive on today that they're consistent with what you did before right so uh i mean this really only displays uh th those cases where you
disagreed but if you sorta like change a rule now on the fly then that might be then that might b uh create inconsistencies
with the
yeah

just out of curiosity this narrow and broad band that that refers to the type of spectrogram that you have like t on the type of filter or is it oh okay yeah okay

mm hmm
oh was it actually possible to doubly underline things um
i don't know wh which one it would display then
i i actually didn't know that it was possible to have these so you you you allowed these kind of embedded uh annotations right okay
mm hmm okay
mm hmm


that's pretty good that's nearly a third
uh yeah fine now
oh it's not liking us it went that a way
computer adjusting oh
uh
okay so
right
you ready back there

uh okay
welcome everyone um this is the kick off meeting for the day um we're the new group uh to create a new remote control for real reaction
as you can see our agenda is to open up the meeting um become acquainted with each other
um have a little training on tools uh create a plan discuss things
and and we only have twenty minut twenty five minutes total
okay the new remote control is to be original trendy and user friendly
that steph is your part is the user friendliness the originality um is gonna take
all of us um the trendiness we'll probably go look at for some marketing research information
from you sarah um and we'll get on with it okay so
we'll have a functional design individual work um with meeting
and then conceptual design t and then detailed design
okay right everybody's supposed to try out the whiteboard kate why don't you try it first if you can either bring your things with you i guess
and while you're doing that we'll try and figure out how to hook these things on as well 'cause we're all gonna have to be able to walk around

uh i do not think so i think it's just to try out the whiteboard

ah

uh huh
okay
great and the characteristics
uh huh
okay
fantastic since you're handy as well why don't you do yours next steph
i think it's to get us used to using the pen
uh no
a mouse y
oh
argh rat
not a mouse a rat

and your favourite characteristics of that animal
oh okay kate

oh a fish
oh okay fine
favourite characteristics
'kay
so they have team elements
i'm afraid i'm with steph
and i think your pen's running out of whatever
but i'm afraid i take the coward's way out and the cat's looking the other way he's hiding
um cats are sometimes very independent my parents had cats uh and they can mm decide for themselves what is best
okay
now um we have to get down to the nitty gritty of
how to make this and this remote control has to be sold
um we're to sell it for twenty five euros with a profit aim ultimately
of fifty million euros that tells you something about how many um
we have to sell on an international scale um would be an awful lot of these
would be like what a hundred million of them um to make twenty five euros on each one
and to make a total profit of fifty million um the production is to only cost
twelve and a half euros per item
now if they cost twelve and a half you're selling it for twenty five you're making twelve and a half
euros each um and we're to make a profit of fifty million that's t uh
can you do the maths and how many are we selling
mark up
okay

yes 'cause our market um is international and your problem is has to do with
marketing of you know you gotta know how many we're going to be selling to know how big a market
you have to target and who is that
to give you a pretty good idea of where you're looking
something like that
okay
that's fifty million euros in order to make fifty million euros and you're only getting twelve and a half each
that's a lot of selling
two four
to be fifty be four million you'd have to sell four million
okay
right
experience with a remote control any of you use of remote control for a television or d v d  or something you're both nodding all three
well
i've seen some remote controls that are for more than one device at a time but i also have heard about them not working well or not well co ordinated and you wind up working with this one for thi this three and then this one over here for another
and they don't always talk to each other
don't know
okay are there any um ideas for the remote what would it be for and what group would be be for
we have to think about that one


okay
mm
okay
yeah um i know this sounds like it was very quick but the
i think that's the industrial design is the first one that's kate for the working design
and user that's you s steph for the technical functions design
and for marketing the user requirements specification i think there's going to be a lot of
we have to help each other and work through this as a group and i think we all you know
we like our kitty cat and our rat and our fish but i think we all have to like each other um
to get this done uh as it says we're gonna get individual instructions but uh
i don't think they allowed a lot of extra time so i think a little bit of less of this and more at do
will set us in good stead do you all agree
alright um then i don't see any reason to prolong it and f we
should finish this meeting at ni right now and go into other things alright so
this is the end of the first meeting thank you all
uh yeah if i can pick up with all these bits and pieces hang on
uh right so you want an animal and the characteristics of that animal do you have to be able to recognise what animal it is um
only animal i could thin i could draw
its a sort of bunny rabbit cat you can tell it's not a bunny rabbit by the ears um i suppose it should have a mouth as well sort of
right yeah
um the favourite characteristics of the cat um the whiskers i think um because they're the easiest to draw in fact i'll give it some more
oh and the tail
yes um sure it's not to test our artistic
it's a mouse
no it's not a mouse
it's a wombat
a what
a webbed foot webbed f oh right


gosh why didn't i think of fish that's even easier to draw than cat



that that that's the sorta product we're talking about one that will work for a in a home environment for a t v s and


i think one that works would be good
mm
mm hmm
mm hmm
'kay

are we all gonna draw a cat

that's not a mouse y no
it's a ratty
a ratty
it's clothes that's it's clothes
it's a ratty with a with a with a very long tail
i love whiskers
uh they're intelligent and they're cheeky and
uh fantastic pets and very friendly and they sit on your shoulder and whisper the answers to your homework in your ear when you're doing your homework
a shark
it is true that you always sit around you know you're sitting on your sofa and you wanna change something there's five different
remotes and one for the d v d  and one for the video and one for cable and one for whatever
else but i presume this is t i presume this is just for television
i think one in b bright colours would be good
i think one that doesn't have lots of superfluous functions like i've got one at home that has
well apart from the obvious channels channel up channel down volume
you know subtitles mute there's a lotta buttons that i've got no idea what they do like
mm
ooh closing the meeting
that was quick
mm hmm
is this okay
i know
thanks
mm this is very representational fish um i like them because they're sleek and they have a lot of freedom but they also do n uh swim in groups so
do you have a favourite one


uh yeah i was just wondering if that's the um
if fifty percent is normal
b yeah um i would think would be more like sixty percent
but um let me i have two thoughts one hundred fifty percent
and and your question is how many do we have to sell
at twenty five
mm hmm
yeah that's um
so that's four million of them
yeah
and if we make
mm hmm
yeah
four million
hmm
yeah
mm hmm
y yeah

we could make a hello kitty
themed remote
yeah we could totally go for the japan a mation well i mean there's also the cachet that um uh the japanese make great products electrical their industrial design is very good
yeah
well that's a really good point because i think one of the things that being somewhat computer literate
we tend to um go to menus and then make choices you know so if it's like an uh volume button
you know you can go in and say mute or or volume we don't need to have like the l the numbers if we also
have uh uh channel up channel down
mm we can make it smart like an ipod you know make everything menus
okay
okay oh that's not gonna work

oh alright
okay
okay um alright
i'll just put that there uh as you all know we're here to create a brand new fantastic
remote uh i'm nick debusk i'm the project manager
uh we'll just get started with everyone kind of letting each other know who
they are and what you're doing what your what your role is um
go ahead
'kay
okay
um so we've got our opening our our agenda is the opening
uh acquaintance which we've kinda done uh tool training project plan discussion
and then closing uh grand total of twenty five minutes we have here
um so we are putting together a new remote control um
we want it to be something original um of course we're a not only a electronics
company but a
fashion um conscious electronics company so we want it to be trendy um and we want it to be easy to use
um
we've got the functional design conceptual design and detailed design um which basically is is the three of you um
and
w uh well um functional design um
um do we have um
any ideas of of maybe d let's just throw out some ideas of what kind of remote control we want to have and then we can go into how we're gonna design it and
and how we're gonna do the detailing on it
so we want it to be um a t v  remote or i i mean do we want it to to do other things besides just be a a television remote
'kay
mm hmm 'kay
i i think yeah yeah r universal remote um this is my first uh go round with creating a remote control so i think we're all in the same boat here
um
okay
so we should we should set our remote control up to where it has a uh
like a tracking device or or like a a
it makes a noise there's a button on the t v  that you press and
'kay
yeah do we want so they're kinda like long and rectangular do we want something crazy you know we want something new that's gonna stand out a m a modern so our remote should be
'kay
um
okay so yeah so we want it to be sturdy we want it to to hold up to somebody's
child you know throwing it across the room or as you said people kinda throw it so ball shaped
uh you know if it were ball shaped maybe then it
'kay um so we want it to be modern fun sturdy
um
so our form and our function um we want it to be um
easy to find
um

what else
it what else do we want it to to do so we want it to be universal
it's something that we're supposed to sell for about twenty five euros um
and
you know goals for profits are i think somewhere around uh fifty million euros what they wanna make on it so
'kay
so marketing you know how maybe uh
marketing you could s find out what is the most universally um appealing remote control out there
'kay
um

do you guys have any ideas for what it should look like maybe we could draw it up on the on the board over there some ideas
we want it to be a b a ball you know we'll draw up we'll draw up the ball and maybe th um where the buttons are located

uh huh
how would we go about um
making you know getting rid of our weak points what i mean would we just have a flat spot on the bottom of the ball not to put you on the spot but
what did you say your title was again
you're the the industrial designer

okay

yeah
it's not new it's not innovative it's you know everybody does long remote because it's easy it's it's stable um
so if no go ahead
something with a grip
yeah because even i suppose even with the ball
it's it might not be the easiest to hold onto um
so perhaps the the joystick the the keyboard idea
might work better but then again people like to use one hand to flip and one hand to hold their soda
so maybe maybe we
i feel like i'm just shooting everything down here uh um
yeah
okay so unfortunately we've got about five minutes here
to come up with our um remote control idea and start rolling with
it um we've talked about our experiences with remote control and um we've got
a couple ideas um
let's see here
what if we had what if we had not only um say we went with the ball the
ball function um but maybe we give it sort of grips
along the side s
um to make it easier to hold on to so
you know um s so it's easier to hold onto that way course
that'll then remove some of our our ball unless this unless this part were raised
so say the cover flips over and covers that part
so the grip is
no that wouldn't work either um
but if we're gonna make it flat on the bottom then that eliminates our ball anyways so if it were flat on the bottom and then had the
sorta grips on the side here i guess
um
and then
flat uh
and then we have the problem with the hinge
so if we're flat on the bottom it's not gonna roll away it'll stay where we want
mm that's true
so we don't have it flip open
we just have a ball
okay so then we forget the ball it looks
cool but it's really not it's not functional um so we've got our
sort of keyboard kind what if we flipped it around here so that it were
um
sorry that doesn't look anything like what you had there um so it's up and down you hold it this way
course then it's it's like the rectangular again only with a couple of jutting out points but it's one handed um
yeah
yeah
yeah because it doesn't have a cord like joysticks do
is it possible to have it to where it would work with a like a sensor on either side
so that either way you're pointing it it would work
more expensive and yeah
'kay
um
true
'kay
are we out of time okay well just to finish up should we s go with this plan start making some
are good ideas what are not
uh
must finish now so and then marketing will look and see what uh what people want
okay and project manager will design a better meeting for next time around be a little bit more prepared and uh alright good meeting
right i'm manuel and i'm the industrial designer in in this project
um in the functional design phase i'm i'll be dealing mostly with the requirements
um we'll discuss what the prog what functions the the product has to fulfil
and so and so on um i suppose we'll work pretty much together on that one um um
in the conceptual design um i'll be pro mostly dealing with properties and materials um of our product
and uh the detailed design in the detailed design i'll be concerned with the look and feel
of the product itself um so we're pretty much working together
obviously on the design front here okay

mm
mm mm
right
so

mm
well there are of course certain restrictions you can't have it be any form and fulfil all functions
at the same time so there are always the some restrictions we have to apply here um however
um one question is how stable is that thing supposed to be that refers to the material pretty much
um what are we gonna build that thing out of how sturdy is it gonna be do we want it
to last longer or rather have people
whatever have to buy one every half a year

right


right one problem you'd get with this design is um the ball is a nice idea because of it's stability really
but of course since it's a ball it'll roll so we'd have to have it flat on one side at least
down here somewhere take away that part that's one of the big issues also also
you risk the hinges here that's that's um a problem
that's that's interesting of course but that's of course a weak point yeah
e no no uh uh
n n
uh i'm your industrial designer so i b well the point is
that
well maybe i dunno the shape is perhaps not the most ideal
as as stable as it is there must be a compromise between um stability
and design here so
mm
mm
well with the one handed design you also have the the problem of the size w 'cause you know from cell phones they can be too small so if the remote is too small it if it's small it probably looks better but
may not be th as functional
so for that there's
so
the question is also i dunno d do you really always want to open that thing when you have to use it
it's probably going to lie around opened all the time anyway so i don't know if a lid is a good idea
from stabil stability point of view uh it certainly is but also you
have to face it and take into account the more of these things break by accident
uh the more we sell so it's don't make it too stable
uh
to the other design
it looks cool
uh functional
right right
question is what makes those game pads functional w i think that's pretty much the form for
full hand so it's a round shape underneath that makes it comfy right makes it nice
so that's the essential part except for that i think we'll not probably not get a get away from some longer
design
'cause you also have to know which way around to point this thing
you know all that dif batteries right and
batteries go weak as well so um after a while you have to point it towards the uh
towards the equipment you wanna control with it right so have to m
show which is the front which is the back
i suppose you could do that o of course the more technology you stick in that the more it'll cost so
course you can do that
i mean of course it'll be evident after a while or if you look at it it'll it'll be evident which way around to point it since you have the the numbers
and the and the the buttons and stuff but um it's rather about an instinctual thing
like you just grab it you don't have to s look at it you know which way around to point it otherwise the design of or the
the point of putting two sensors on both sides um would probably work
mm
let's obviously
alright

hiya i'm ryan um i'm the user interface designer um likewise i've three
different roles for each stage of design um the functional design is looking at the tex technical functions of
a remote control um in the concept design the user interface how the user
reacts with the the product and the detailed design um sort of like the user interface
design what they might be looking for uh things like fashions what makes wha how we're gonna make it special
that's about it
yeah

yeah well uh s function of remote control is just just you know change channels is its main function
oh right i suppose you c try make it a universal remote for could work on all sort of electrical
products in in one person's house but you know they all sorta have the same role changing channels volumes and then programming
i think they all work on the same prin principle as well sorta like i don't actually know but is it just infra red is that standard
ye yeah

um one thing i thought of with the remote control is you always lose 'em
so if there's a g a way of finding it quite easily i thought that'd be quite good quite a good feature
oh you can get those key well you could whistle or make a noise and it'd beep
yeah
generally all remotes are sort of quite similar in their appearance
just long
yeah black usually
yeah
i think so
maybe sorta spherical or something a ball
yeah
people i thought maybe because people always tend to throw a remote control about the place to one another if it was in a ball and maybe the actual controls are inside or something
yeah
yeah
yeah
it could be cased on the outside and t everything could be inside
ye
small
i'd i could draw sorta the ball idea
my original idea was just simply
sort of a sphere where maybe you
this is where it's connected together and then when you open it out it could fol it could be maybe flip like a flip phone and then when you fold it out the middle
maybe a hinge that'll have to be the strongest part of it if that if we did use a hinge or if it was just two parts and then you'd have
just sorta you you you know your buttons
thing is inside i think sometimes remotes have too many buttons so maybe as simple as possible um as few buttons inside as possible
um i dunno what's the idea for just something maybe if you ha if it had like if some kind of
like light or something or lights around it it's looking a bit like something out of star wars at the moment though to be fair but yeah
that was that was a sorta simple idea i had and then you know you could about
right it would almost be like a ball so that was just just an idea i had i don't know whether anybody else has other ideas
yeah
yeah
maybe f yeah
yeah that's g that's a good idea
yeah the idea it didn't have to necessarily be f a hinge that was just one idea though
yeah

well i i suppose that things become design but i mean i
i was trying to think of like the design of others i can't think of anything other than a long rectangle for remote maybe small sort of fatter ones but there's nothing being done sort of out of left field yeah
yeah
yeah
i think definitely doing something different
is a good idea
i mean maybe design something that's sort of like uh i suppose not everybody's everybody's hand's the same but something that would maybe fit in the hand easier
yeah with a grip
it still might be hard to it still not the ho easiest thing to hold yeah
like yeah
yeah
it's d yeah i think it's definitely got to be a a one handed a one handed job

yeah
but then maybe to go back to the to th s something along those things then
yeah
put it
even if you designed it in some in a way that you know isn't a rectangle but still pointed in a direction that had definite points so if that's your thing and you got something like that instead and there's your s you kn you know which way you're gonna pointing it
um
does it say what does it say for n it says on there what we need to do for the next meeting i think
t
uh uh um
okay i am corinne whiting and i will be the marketing expert and in each
of the three phases i will have a different role in the function design phase
i will be talking about user requirement specification and this means what needs
and desires are to be fulfilled and i'll be doing research to figure this out in the conceptual
design phase i will be dealing with trend watching and i'll be doing marketing research on the web
and then finally in the um detailed design phase i will be doing product evaluation
and so i will be collecting the requirements and ranking all the requirements to see how we did

mm
huh

ours too
mm
ch
like a tracking device
mm
be good
lot more modern
maybe like user friendly like a little
you know where you can use both hands like a little keyboard type thing
mm
mm
mm
also since we're partners of the international remote control association maybe we wanna make it something that would globally appeal
that's more on the research end but the marketing
yeah
and maybe as far as design goes maybe we could have different ones for different target audiences 'cause maybe one won't apply to all of the countries we're targeting

futuristic





mm hmm

'kay i'll draw something what my idea was just to have it be kind of like a
keyboard type shape you know like video games l so but maybe i mean that would be kinda big and bulky we could also try to do the hinge thing so it could like flip out that way i don't know
that's my idea
yeah
mm yeah
true
mm
that's fine you're the boss you're allowed to
yeah
looks cool though yeah

mm
right
yeah
sorry to interrupt but we have a warning to finish yeah
mm
great


can i close this
oh okay

there we go
okay here we are again detailed design oh come on
well ah s forgot to insert the minutes but it's about the same thing we discussed before uh
could open that anyway think
other design anyway we took as we took w we took rubber as as the material last time
we also that you're just busy with it took the advanced chip to t uh implement the advanced features well
we discussed the design no sharp corners we rounded it off like you see on the other screen which is fine
um we agreed that the colour should be b uh yellow and black yellow in the back because it's m
trendy more trendy than black anyway so then we ca yeah
we agreed that we would implement both the l c d  and speech recognition but i'll get to that in a moment 'cause some
changes in the finances have
left us implications anyway so so like i said we had no insight in finances no prices but we have 'em now
and it's bad anyway
we are
oh prototype presentation well first you guys built the prototype so you could could present that but um let's see what be handy to do
nee no you just go ahead and present the w we'll scrap it later because

what
oh that's
hasn't changed that much huh i didn't expect anyway you just coloured it
mm hmm i like the menu
mm hmm
and i suppose the the the yellow is not printed on the on the rubber it's it's part of the rubber i suppose i think that's more i think that's more durable anyway than printed on to
oh yeah
mm hmm
okay
yeah
okay now it's my time to ruin everything well not ruin everything but no
nah finances that's what we have here what you drew
we have battery power we have advanced chips and the sam the sensor the sample sensor and
uh for speak recognition anyway so which you see the which is de o one of the most expensive parts
so well we have sin one curve a design rubber design
and we had a special colour suppose yellow is a special colour so just half a euro
for you have pushbuttons and an l c d  display you have the total of seventeen euros in
production cost which is higher than the twelve and a half that we are permitted to use so
easy what do we scrap well think i had the best solution that i came up with is just to s take out the speech
recognition
because the l c d  has more support on customer side there are ninety one percent of uh the people or something like that but ninety percent who favour an l c d  display and only sixty percent that favour speech recognition i think it's also harder to
so i ju i took that out so and so it's still stuck with thirteen so i had to take out the special colour i suppose and yeah i didn't see anything else i could take out
yeah i could take out the push buttons but we need those so generally what i came up with
in order to be cou to to have production cost of twelve and a half euros spe scrap speech recognition
and the separate covers can account for the if people want it we'll just then we'll do it in black
we'll just deliver it in black have the it has all the function that it's supposed to have and if you want it if you want the custom design
then you can buy the separate covers you make it d orange or whatever you want
it was a big issue but
i'll just go back uh let's just let's see what okay let's just see what we no we we have to be under twelve and a half it it's not uh the project is a no go if we go over twelve and a half so
i think you that's what you were ass assigned to do really to to see how b th both those work together so i think yeah it's i think it's y one of the it's a good way to um
to help people uh to make to keep the product trendy too just keep you just make new covers for the for it
like we agreed before and everything that's left is is the basic function that
uh that we want our product to have because the expensive parts are in either the advanced chip but we
need that for the l c d  display then again we have the l c d  display which is also expensive b yeah but those go together
and yeah we could take out the curve
could we could take out the curve is that an option
for you
yeah

i think it's it it does ruin it but the fact that i t took that decision or t
took this example actually not really decision but the example is because we do offer the
um the possibility of adding your own custom covers so you can change any colour
you want so it's just you deliver a basic remote control with a possibility to change you into whatever you want
you can take plastic but i d it's something that's stuck into my mind is that something that really came forward from the marketing research
is that people like the the the the squishy feeling of the spongy feeling of the and
it really makes it also makes it different from the existing remote controls because they're all plastic so which in in
turn rubber would increase durability because it doesn't break
i al like i said i lost the speech recognition and i lost the special colour which would make this black a black and grey yeah that's that that that's enough because
i guess those are the basic colours so oh
i think those are basic col
they want to
to ensure the profit that that's th that's the order we're just uh we're the project team and we got our our orders from the pro
from the boss of our company which say we don't wanna spend more than twelve fifty for this but that's not for our
that's not our decision to take we have a budget of twelve fifty per product so
stick that i don't think it's really bad either i mean if we we have the the backup of or the backup design thing
to have i think they would do th i think they do like because yo we you we agree upon that the
that the the the cover thing was a nice idea because p you could have all sort of designs while at the same
time just manufacturing one product one basic product which you could turn into any any taste you want so
i think it's the best solution to make those cu custom covers
for the design aspect and keep the functionality between of within the th the boundaries of the
your f uh your budget so

well i don't think yeah is it worth is it is it does it mean anything to the customer like it like we don't care we don't care that you had to
true but we did we didn't get that so i think it's it should either be a pack maybe we sh that should be sold in in the s in stores with with a standard cover or something but
they could but uh
it's an option but yeah it's true so actually uh it's not that much of an increase but yeah we cannot
contact them it's just the order that we got so that's what we gotta go with so it's either
one fi just just to get it f just to get it through final it's either turned into plastic
drop the squishy feel make it make it more breakable um or
turn it yellow so
it's uh something we have to decide on
i say lose the curve oh that's true we could lose the c yeah i forgot that sorry uh the curve so that's just this one just d this is the banana curve
so this would this would be straight
no uh no that would be a curve inside the thing i guess no would ju then it would just be a straight remote just like like that
which would yeah turn it into something far more ordinary we could make it yellow then but
you second that you second that we lose the curve
okay yeah
so i think it would be a good idea to keep the curve to separate it from the rest of the remote control world so to speak so we keep the curve
so the only only solution is either to use the l y lose the yellow or lose the rubber and i'm in favour of keeping the rubber because it has more more advantages than the colour yellow has
mm hmm
yeah um i guess people are willing to pay for that so i think we can take that option and just with uh with the idea in the back
of our head that you can customise your remote control so i think that would still make it a nice product okay we're final
on that so it's too bad we can't make the whole super thing but anyways
we're here um yeah
this we discussed just now
that's just now just we could just discuss how the project went i mean was kind of
i sort of expected that everything would turn out this way but because you yeah everything cannot
be for free we didn't i think it was too bad we didn't have the financial info the last time because
that was i th it was really essential really to ma because we spent uh uh entire stage designing
a product of which we had no idea what it would cost so we just put something i think it's
really nor not in stroke with reality actually so

yeah
yeah i think would have been materials would be ok at least the last meeting i would have expected had to have that so i suppose
yeah let's see if it sells i mean i suppose this sells because it's very very extended but
i suppose it sells because it's good i mean it's got everything for the for the reasonable price because we didn't know what it's gonna cost anyway

okay
have been met okay
yeah

they're stuck under menu
for the menu i think those are totally met because we we really took them for the they have the feel they want they have the simplicity they want i think it's very uh very well met either two or one maybe
i think we took that everything they wanted into consideration so it could either be a two or a one
one and a half
just create our own option
yeah
it's perfect even for deaf people yeah it's i don't think it's perfect but we did everything possible to to get it back because if it's stuck in you couch you can see the light maybe you can hear it but i mean we tried so i think it that's that deserves a one
definitely

i'd use an remote control
it's pretty straight forward uh huh
i think but we didn't even there was no issue on making a manual actually we didn't really discuss it but
i don't think it takes no it really does doesn't take time to learn i think we took it s it's so easy we have so little button everything speaks
for itself really so i think that's yeah we didn't it's either two or one i guess maybe it's a two because
d uh the l c d  is a little is a little new and there is there are some option hidden under the menu button so
i might make this a two instead of a one i guess
so just make that a two
you can use the l c d  in a good way i think so i think it's perfect the w where it is what it can do if it useful i think so
no y i mean in the l c d  screen the small screen what does it display
well i thought it was i thought it was i thought that people wanted previews on their i'm not sure if that even possible but 'cause it's this requires a quite quite a bit of band width i don't think it's possible really but
the they didn't really define in what should be used for
but i think in for example like t v  guides i think that's that th that you can transmit through it and everything just for extra information on your programmes
but also things like like like menus or p how about preferences of your uh with configuring your remote control for
favourite your favourite channel for example how do you configure that so that could be done by l c d  display i think it's good
no maybe it's not a one because it's we're not using it perfectly we didn't give it i don't thing over discussing now we gave it
enough thought though i think we d should just lower this maybe maybe it's a three though we could've used it more effectively
probably

yeah we are using it but it's not it's not poorly used but it's not efficiently used i think we could have ev even lost
the selection button and uh done everything via l c d  selection it's now it's just extra
to illustrate im uh extra features but okay
can you talk to remote control well it can't talk anymore so we scrap that
oh yeah just to be a prick but of course you can talk to your remote control it doesn't do anything but you c you can talk to it
well we did take everything into consideration of course uh the shape i shape is i
i think we yeah i think that's okay
yeah special co but we took into consideration the fact that it's customisable to the fashi
we don't have it we do have it it's just sold as a package it does it's not part of the basic product
it that that's what i call trendy i mean the shape is trendy the the sh the the functions are trendy it's just the colours that are not supporting the basic model because you ha it's just not affordable at the moment
it's possible but you have to pay extra for the for the possibility of having it in a f a different colour

overall score
one two three sixteen
two two point some two point something
two and two thirds

it's okay but that's yo m mostly it's it's influenced by the fact that we didn't have enough resources to implement speech recognition 'cause yeah that gives you a seven which ruins your your average
without that it would be like under it wouldn't yeah it would be under two so i think we have even with this it's reasonable
well i think it's two is okay
yeah two is pretty good
definitely
yeah i think it's probably i i do admit that we d did miss a little or didn't sp didn't talk talk enough about the possibility of the l c d  display we could have used it more efficiently we just didn't think of it that way
so like i said changing channels everything hidden in your l c d  display so you just need the navigation buttons to do everything
i think we div i think we did very well uh ev even if you look at this score we did quite well it just looking for improvements what what you could have improved so
they sh they should get kids and just stick 'em in t v  and say change the channel
i don' think so uh it's just not it it's not affordable or your sh you should lose the l c d  screen probably but i think that's i think the l c d  screen is more worth than speech recognition
definitely okay that was that
so that's the final product without the speakers i guess let's see what was left in the the another one

hmm yeah we evaluate the product
general project what's i in for example i thou i thought we were pretty creative
in what we created we took the whole new approach of making exchangeable cover for example which
i thought was pretty creative because it was never never ever listed somewhere
well
anyways yeah leadership is up to you i mean perhaps i screwed up because i d put a put a speech
recognition into it but that's not for me to decide i think we did pretty well as team work though because yeah was very hard
to work with one another if you cannot communicate in the meantime because when i got the when i got the input for the financial results
initially of course i wanted to contact you say look this is you're doing the wrong thing you're s you're wasting your time
now because we're implementing stuff that we cannot afford so it would be better if y if there was more communication
between uh because that's that's what would w you what you would normally do either call or email someone so
that was too bad con was impossible here anyways
it didn't have or didn't knew what they costs or whatever there was just too little information about what things actually cost and if you could
use them so that was a little unclear i suppose i think a smartboard smartboard is pretty cool
i think uh s especially for design issues it's very easy just to give your give your thoughts a little
it's easier to share them
it's a little less it the response time is le it's very bad it's good to visualise everything but i think the response time should could be a lot better
definitely
yeah it's true
no you don't have to no you don't i jin i didn't check the finish button i just you just ditch it and you can copy
it or whatever uh only if you uh check the notes or press done then
it um then you can then it exports to word automatically but it's not necessary to check either one of those two
you can just preview your p you can just preview your page in the in the programme
okay before starting a ne a new page okay that could be b
okay
yeah okay
that's
yeah it's understandable okay any new ideas yeah more communication between
between uh that's the thing i noticed that communication is very um very important because if you get
new information it's essential f for the other team mates to know that as soon as possible because
you would avoid making doing extra work because you were doing extra work now uh m working on the on the speech recognition
you have limitation both on the technical on the d on the design side so i think that could have been better
but that's i think it's more of a a setting here that you cannot communicate than uh than somewhere else so
yeah i think so and l less p less spam probably i'm not sure i i'm not sure you got spammed as well but i get spammed like every t every
two minutes there was a there was another email about master classes or something so which were totally useless actually i thought
i should probably look into them but they were all useless so i just
oh okay

i didn't have any uh more information it's just always the same here so that's that's kind of a
it would change but not for me so i'd i had no extra information to go on that one than what you give me actually i couldn't do any research myself or i see that's yeah w i could have done a little extra work probably then
but i was busy enough anyway so
any new ideas found or is that a 'cause uh yeah it's well probably is
i have no clue that's like oh but it
should i if the project is evaluated and it was it was in b within budget we should celebrate so
uh okay think that's about it uh
i'm not sure what we should still do though uh t let's see what all your tasks were finished right what you ha from your assistant so let's
okay i should i think i sh i still have the the total report to finish up i think we took very little time now because
yeah we're in agreement everything the design is okay the one thing we missed though
we don't have a product name
how about you cook a how about you cook up a product name
just oh think of a catchy name i'll be working on this until the beep until it beeps so
what fruit
you don't want it to resemble a banana it's not yellow anyway it's not yellow anymore it is curved but
no it's
hmm

real reaction future r c 
step into the future of of remote controlling your t v 
no that's a that's a catchy slogan
control your remote control
i go for future r c  probably
something like
it's short f
real reactor
uh that that's
that makes me think of different products than a remote control really
i'm not sure real reaction in a real
real reactor
didn't notice
mm
i take f yeah take a banana
hmm
no not like that it should be it should be longer because it's not a product name that you f print on a box
just write out triple like a word triple r c  triple stripe oh triple dash r  dash s s c 
yeah

r  dash c 
dash triple r  or triple r c 
how about do both
sure if it looks stupid
uh i think that the the r c  together takes away the the the image of it's a triple
uh the first the first one looks like it's a triple remote control but it's only a single remote control and it's especially on the triple r  that's important the real reaction remote
yeah triple r  yeah you can
yeah triple r 
banana remote
i think we're all in agreement about the triple r  i think triple r  is cool
and it looks cool when you print it in font looks pretty cool
just like this just and you just print triple r  it looks doesn't look bad it's short it's okay so have to write my report now i guess um
um
yeah so we have everything we have the product we have the costs we have the possibility
of everything okay i think it's adjourned retire to my lair and finish the
report
that was a short meeting
but efficient though
probably see okay goodbye
could you guys draw me a picture of the final design to put on the cover of the report

uh we don't have any changes do we so no

it's basically what we agreed upon but just a little bit more specified
uh s
final design
basically in what we discussed cover and buttons will be made of rubber yellow colour black components
as you can see right over here we chose a different type of colour for the menu
a bit darker yellow so that it com really shows in this keypad
if you put them all black it's not really that good a contrast so
probab yeah that's the be
and it i guess it's more easier to just paint it on the rubber than to uh
so we have it's a bit round shaped that's what we had uh
we chose the buttons to be uh teletext okay button favourite channel and the mute so that's basically what we chose there if you have anything to add please interrupt me
oh
that's pretty much it
oh sorry
i'd say that too
uh we don't really have a extra function with the speech sample which you can't do with a normal remote control which people already do so
well i'd i tend to disagree with you on that because the trend issue was a big issue when we started designing this so can't we just basically extend it to thirteen
okay
yeah we do
we could take out a curve indeed
i think the colour is more important than the really the curve because if you just end up with an entirely black remote control
so black and grey is okay
which we can fabricate okay
no we basically
we need to stick to that
but they don't
well
and if we
so which curve is that ba that's basically that curve
so we could u still have the comfort
i second that

no that it would turn out to be a pretty straight forward remote control so that's not really that
i would
yeah i would say i would agree with you on the colour because that's an extra option an extra service we can deliver for a little bit of more money so we can always do that
which is basically what we discussed
yes we could have
well i hope it sells
which are basically accessible through the menu button
yeah
which is not an option
to make it that way yeah
mm yeah
and it's pretty straight forward you have a navigation no keys to navigate through the l c d  menus so
one i d no actu
no it it is pretty straight forward
yeah
yeah
well basically the menu options indeed but
no
yeah
yeah two or three so
you can seven
or we could say it
or we could say neutral we 'cause we scratched the
c
no we don't have the colour so i
yes but the end product so

maybe we should go with a two then because it's not perfect because we can't do it initially but we
yeah
overall score
ten sixteen
divided by
is two two third
there's
yeah if we make it into a four as in neutral because we didn't implement it so we can't say that we that it's really not well implemented we come out on a average of two one eighth
so which is pretty w good it's at least on the positive side so we could definitely have done better if we've had more resources but
yeah true


so did you

yeah
and we could share information which we received
yeah
although for actual design i'd say the response time should be a little bit higher because
the digital pen was definitely better to draw my ideas and to
further elaborate on that so
oh can you okay
yeah well it could also possibly be well is it a more real time information base so we can all see which information is available to one another
well i personally did not have that but
that's probably your l description but i also didn't not really but still you had that as well is that we finished up the design and then we checked the website and then there was just extra information
there was a little delay in the bit of a c
crucial delay
how much time do we have for this anyway
yeah champagne
product name
the bana 'cause it's not yellow anymore
well uh i was going for the r c  deluxe but it's not really a catchy name or anything it's more
something with our company name can we do anything with that
maybe there's something on the website which will help us out
the reaction deluxe
is that a name or a c campaign yeah
or the
the real reactor
you should write it down as a an option

so that's one option
should i write the banana down or
sure
well i
uh do you mean it like
you mean it like this
dash c 
like a c  right now or a dash in a c 

is it triple r c s no
well that's another option
okay so which ones are we going to scratch
definitely

i say this one as well
triple r 
triple r  it is

yeah sure
i don't really know whether we can save it as a picture or no
sure
network places

i wouldn't pick that one no
sure oh
i see you later
i think it's more or less the same as we had
no much s
no no no not at all
hmm
yeah of course
that's uh the integration story again
no uh this is just a description of what we see there so
speaks for itself
hmm
i d
yeah
hmm
hmm
huh

okay but there's another problem
but there's another problem if we take another cover for instance black then we also need another button frame 'cause black and black doesn't work obviously
huh
huh yeah
hmm
hmm
right
i agree
mm hmm
or say let's lose rubber take plastic
yes
although we are demolishing a little bit the style but
yeah
can we then not also uh change the material we take plastic for the basic cover and
we can put those to the to the other covers
that's true
but okay
but what do you then suggest we'd lose because we have to lose two things and i guess
yes
okay and that's enough
hmm
hmm
perhaps we should make m
huh
perhaps we should make clear to our customer that we had to do this to stay under the cost and that's uh they know that this is an option and that we had to drop the option to stay under the cost that they know that
perhaps they decide tha
of course perhaps they uh no but perhaps they think uh okay the cover is such a nice idea uh let's that that then they uh that allow us to make some more costs
we ca we uh we can at least tell them that
you don't know that
huh
no i'm not uh talking about that cost but the one that g has given us the order to design this we could at least m uh make it like this like you said and then tell them okay we had to drop this and that just that you know it is an still an option but not for this price
exactly but
hmm
i'd say lose the curve and the colour and
hmm
hmm
hmm
oh
i agree
no
hmm
yes
huh
hmm
me too i felt a bit blind throughout the project because in the beginning i had no list of available materials and then i d had not list of available c finances so
hmm
hmm
hmm
one
hmm
manual
i think the l c d  display could be a little bit more difficult then a normal remote control but then again it's for young people so
yeah i th
exactly
no that's true
i think it won't be a big problem
ah um
with the more important functions on
mm hmm
mm hmm
the menus uh
things like brightness and uh those kind of things we've put in the menu because we have no buttons for those
yes
mm
yes
nah it's not really only an extra no menus think about
hmm
but
m
changing covers is also trend that we followed
mm hmm
mm hmm
hmm
six
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
hmm of course
mm hmm
but i think for this price this is it's really a reasonable product it's a good product
oh
oh yeah but if pep people really want speech recognition then they must be prepared to pu to pay more because it's cannot be done for this
hmm yeah
ah but for this price uh you cannot ask that you cannot th think of that
no it's not
mm hmm
oh it's also more attractive
hmm
yes
hmm
hmm
yeah
huh
hmm
hmm
hmm
that's the same thing that i had in the beginning everybody was using materials that s i didn't have so
oh
hmm
hmm
hmm
mm hmm
but there's uh also one problem with this i noticed uh you have to finish a page before going to a n
oh
okay i saw that uh
hmm
yeah but i made
okay but i made three pages and they were not finished and when the third one was finished i wanted to download it and then it was not possible anymore because you have to close all the pinnits uh the pages before going further
exactly so we cannot work on more than one page at same time that's not possible you have to finish it completely then download it it's then start a new one that's not very uh handy but if you know that then it's not a problem

hmm
mm hmm
ah
well
hmm
huh
yeah
yeah
mm
hmm
hmm
hmm
hmm
no
okay bring out the beer
i have no more email my coach is uh being very silent now
no we haven't think above about that huh it's better than thi i think than a serial number sony uh t r  something uh f means nothing to me uh
like fruit names

uh at least it's not something with numbers numbers are so meaningless to the people i mean
real reaction
real react
the real reactor i don't find that uh that bad at all
yeah because our name is real reaction
i'm looking for things in the name so that the first three letters are s the same r e a  r e a 
the triple r  real reaction remotes control triple r 
yeah
yeah that
i think
triple r  doesn't sound
yeah
ah
i think i like it like this more
hmm
mm
i would huh i would lose the c  and just name it triple r 
it sounds like uh thinking about two different things and combining it i would just say triple r s triple r 
that's also short catchy
banana
yes
did you do now
yeah
yeah
yep
mm hmm
the boss is always the last one to go home so
see you in a minute
okay
can't we take this one
otherwise we have to do it all over again
is it okay if i try is that okay with you
i'll put it back in a minute
okay it has been saving something but where to i don't know
oh can i say exp yes i can export as j  peg
okay can i not put this
wherever i wants
my document is the wrong one huh
i cannot
i don't think so
document and settings
that's a pity that means that we have to gonna draw it again
are you gonna do that okay
that
yes
okay
okay
okay
yes that's correct
okay
no oh it's export
okay
oh of course sorry
hmm
hmm
mm yeah
okay
yeah
hmm
yeah
pushbut
special colour yeah
yeah it
the p
and the p
what
but uh the and
yeah the people
spongy yeah
yeah
and
but
but
the people want to pay for for it so why why uh do we have to keep us uh uh um on the twelve and a half
yeah
but we can take a risk
okay yeah
i hope the people will like it but
yeah
yeah

the first sheet
yeah
yeah
yeah that's better
yeah yeah
yep
yeah

and i want to do that
yeah

yeah
but
let's um see um
um
let's
uh
oh
hmm
okay let's eval evaluate uh the product of us
our design um i have some uh a method a requirements
and scale of i uh will pre present uh some statements and we will
decided together wha what if it's true or false and uh then we see uh if the requirements
of the user are fulfilled or not
and i will
uh make a new blank sheet
so so the buttons the look and feel i thought it was okay but the advanced uh settings um screen audio and channel
we are not
oh the menu button is it
hi oh okay
then it's all uh
s it's true
yeah
so d
oh wait uh pen the p
oh yeah it's red okay but
look and feel is everybo it's true
so
anyone and the next one uh yeah when it's lost uh you can find it it's
yeah and it's
and it's yeah
to that's okay then and the next one
how is that uh w we had we don't have an uh
manual yeah
but i think that's a part of it but
yeah an l c d  it tells a lot about uh
yeah
so it's a one or a i don't know
for the advanced uh settings
no okay that uh that's true
oh so it
takes no ti
yeah
and the l c d  you have to see it
um mm
oh it's a little bit
learning
okay uh yeah it's uh a little bit same but it tells you or not
but wha w oh yeah what are we uh
displaying on the l c d  screen just uh only the channels and or
what uh
oh in the l c d  screen
and for a channel selection uh or that's not
yeah i thought i thought too but yeah
but
maybe a t v  guide or something in your l c d  uh
yeah
yeah it must be clear then what what what for we use it
yeah
yeah
yeah indeed
so everybody's agree with an uh three on it it's
w
yeah
yeah
yeah i
a three
ah nothing that's
a seven uh that's uh
yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah
not with the speech recognition uh yeah all the trends and no colours uh anymore so
yeah uh um only in the curves
but the colours we don't have special colours on it
yeah but we yeah we don't have it so d
in the end product
now
but it's not a one
yeah
oh
oh well
oops
oh it's a two right
on the last one uh that n that's all
overall it's um
ten sixteen
three uh two two point seven or something like that
i don't know why
six
um
so we can say it's it's the product is it's okay
y not
yeah
woah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
 
yeah with
the scale
yeah
with an l c d  screen
yeah you can make 'em another one

yeah
yeah

favourite channel
yeah i know yeah
yeah you're working separate
yeah
yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah direct uh communication with yeah
yeah
my handwriting is little bit yeah
yeah
but th that's
yeah okay
no you can
done and then it's okay
oh okay
okay yeah
okay
oh
hmm
important to mm
yeah
mm
yeah after
after five minutes uh
yeah
email uh
it's
yeah


i want one for my own
yeah
yeah my personal coach i
what
yeah name
or fruit name
fruit name or something like that the banana remote or something i don't know yeah it's the form of it

yeah but
i don't know smart no
ma it's maybe it's not on the network of uh the rest that one is

okay then we'll overall two points yes
yeah
mm

hello so are you d what were j you guys discussing
okay did you find anything new
mm hmm
great great
come on
what's uh here
and there we are
what the f oh yeah uh
it doesn't do what i want it
okay fine that's too bad yeah i have to start our
'kay
okay go again well second phase conceptual design it's fine everybody knows what we're talking about
so take you past the minutes of last meeting again again you get your three presentate to see what you came
up with so too bad we don't have any finance information apparently so that's too bad so
then we'll just have to d uh have to go on you know the information that we have to make the make final decisions on uh on a conceptual design
so
here we go anyway last w last w what discussed last time you all remember that that we have to keep the electronics
size in mind same goes for you we have to have an easy design with big buttons which are durable and there are
people actually spen willing to spend money to do to get more features and uh among those features l c d  screen and voice
recognition are very popular so we have to make a move on that area i guess s especially
s when when the new uh component is applicable in our uh product we'll be fine
anyways well teletext wasn't important and that's what i took and the consumer yeah we aim for young consumers
so that's fine and well actually we yeah we did need some more data on finances
but w yeah we still don't have that apparently that's too bad yeah we need to im de we are going to implement
the beep and the flash thing to recover your remote so one of these interchangeable covers apparently which will
make it a more fashionable product so anyway
guess we'll have to do this after the after the you give your presentations so i'll just close this one now and let's uh let's see we have a lot to tell you had a lot to go on so uh how about you go first



okay
does it provide enough energy
also if if we were choose the the l c d  option would it give enough energy okay that's the just assume it takes
well i'm not sure if it's shaken enough because
no i don't think so because uh watches can go on kinetic energy because they move all the time but i'm sure t i mean remotes lie
still i think like ninety nine percent of the time so i don't think that's a really good the other
alternative were solar cells i don't think that's applicable because
i thin why why shouldn't we take a basic battery
why not i mean everybody everybody knows how to use that it's it's common so and it's available everywhere so why sh mm i think better
yeah but it's
yeah uh it wasn't it wasn't in the options a rechargeable m module actually
okay yeah b you c of course you could place re re chargeable batteries but that's up to the consumer himself so
well mm it's not in the list so we cannot choose from it so
okay will just take regular batteries
okay we'll get back on that later just
but what were the implications if you if put more curves it it's gets more expensive okay so i think with with the extras that we had there it's two curves i suppose okay
also decreases okay
okay
more than one curve uh yeah okay we'll just go uh
'cause it yeah i'm not sure
we'll discuss that later okay we have so i think we can rule out um i'm not sure we can rule anything out we'll do that when y when you get your design
no wood i wood's not an option well it it's stylish but we can yeah but you can change your covers anyway
yeah is it keep in mind that it it's it's uh it fal uh remote controls fall a lot on the ground so you don't want it to break so either have rubber edges or a rubber remote control is very durable but continue
don't have to be un breakable it's p it's a it's not supposed to ju yeah break after one use i mean it they they fall a lot so
well you have for if you if for example if you take hard plastic if it falls it might crack and rubber uh kind of softens the fall
i'm not sure if it's the it's the entire cover you change uh it's could be
you know what th we're focusing very much on the covers now i think it's just w now we're going for the basic design if we wanna expand our options f be fashionable then we can get changeable covers but i think the basic thing let's just rule out wood for now and continue
we're definitely focussing on the younger people 'cause that was our main goal
okay okay we will
mm hmm
mm hmm
evident yeah o of course we're gonna use but i didn't i didn't go on the thought of a scroll wheel actually i'm still deciding on
what what what could you use it for maybe for volume control channel i think that would be annoying because it might accidentally scroll
onto another channel i think a push button for channel would be better i mean it for volume control it's it's a smoother motion
you can just increase or decrease but not sure for channels will be good
i don't think so i haven't i haven't taken it into consideration
i don't think we really need one
but why do we need it
if we don't need it why put it in your why put it in your in your if it's if it's not something people are looking for or is useful
are they
yeah but if it's if it's not useful i don't think it i don't think it gives an extra function to the remote anyway
what you what what'd you get on the l c d  screen is it expensive does it
and how much more expensive is that or
no absolute numbers but it's just more expensive and takes more room i suppose in your in your design
don't think it's an issue okay oh let's go for let's say because it is uh very hot in n our target group i think we should take it take it t to consideration to build an l c d  screen in it
okay
which basically has the same functionality but lacks the l c d  screen okay we'll pick a we'll pick from uh we'll just combine everything later
mm hmm
once again i was would ask you if it's expensive but apparently you don't have any data so
well what d what was exact what you got on the on the new component
that's small so we can implement it so why why if it's small and we can imp why shouldn't we
and there's um get your mar marketing report what was uh the last number of how many people were interested in voice recognition
although it's hard for different countries of course
but you have to programme it yourself i suppose with your own voice
more than sixty percent of the people would like voice recognition
if it's small if it's fits if if people like it why not so
yeah but we got some data on people that actually are int are interested in that and i don't think a scroll wheel offers new functionality whereas speech recognition and l c d  screen do offer new functionality in your product
uh i think so because if i think we're specially w if you're going maybe uh if you have the two editions you wanna wanna give out probably you have one with uh with speech recognition and
um
yeah hold on a minute were were you we're finished or
oh
because if there's something that
'cause have did you have all the materials or everything that you desc
okay so uh just just go for design for now just m have a seat for a second uh
we'll combine everything after this
why is it s why is it squared
why did you pick square or uh not square but why is it yeah sharp corners

looks like a star trek phaser
it's true
yeah or okay so just yeah you can rest it on your finger okay
mm hmm
no it just uh it's a curve inside a thing so
it's on the back
yeah i think it's okay
keys are probably the n the number keys i suppose
okay
well you can work on the actual concept or actual design later with him but
well i think what you have to keep in mind is that um you're moving the the the number keys
from the top uh in the the simple design you have them at a top and the uh complex design you have them at
the bottom so it would that would give us a totally different design so which actually making a whole different product
instead of two different models i think it would be very expensive to produce two whole different products
so

yeah uh or for example why did you pick the mm the numbers uh all the way below and the and the channels and volume control
okay
that's fine that's fine
just as long as you tak took it into consideration what people would prefer uh okay if you all agree i'm fine with it but
okay

yeah i think we'll
i think we're going towards the deluxe edition anyway because that seems to be what the people want but let's see what's what they want now
mm hmm
that's mine
no you should send it to the f to the folder first
okay um let's just assume we go to forty one

mm hmm
mm hmm
i think so
okay
okay so we're definitely going for rubber
let's just go
uh huh
nah i think we're in this case you're losing the the focus on the young group because we're that's what we're focussing on so i think the spongy feel gives us rubber
yeah w th apparently
yeah apparently yeah maybe also yeah i tend to disagree with with uh with a sharp form i suppose it basi if you're uh saying fruits and vegetables maybe it's supposed to be a little little more round
yeah for exa maybe like uh like a pear or something
that's what we're doing
mm
i think shape is is important because they s they really extend
yeah but now you have your your like your star trek phaser thing shaped control so i i th the edges are really really sharp i'm uh not su
or maybe just make it make it up into into a low a smooth curve instead of just less sharp twist on the outside

i think i think there needs to be a little i think it's too too sharp the edges are too sharp the bottom is fine of course if it's square but maybe just th make uh the top a little round it off on the sides so i mean y
that would be two curves
one cur you could also make the curve go through of course but that would make make the top round
but let's see titanium would give us only one curve so but we're not d we're not using titanium
right we did so
just doodle something on the board on the left
well actually we're setting ourselves apart from by technology alone actually
so that let's see what you're doing
oh okay i don't think like that not not really the curves on the on the side of the remote
okay now i uh of course now i understand why they have more uh like um
why the curves
um decrease the the um the size the electronics that can be inside so okay
i don't think the outside would be called as a curve really
i think it's for all the basic well looking from the side anyway well if you see what i have to come up with some designs fast anyway so


okay
well you shouldn't focus on the mostly on the covers because lot of things we came up with shouldn't be too really too much shouldn't be too focussed on the covers because it's kind of an idea of our own but we're not sure if we can actually make that
that's the one thing i'm also afraid of with this one because it the edges are really um they might stick out on the on
the side for example if you have a basic design a little m a little smaller on the on the s on the edges
you could put more covers on it y one one with square or um sharp corners if you want to so m
just round it off a little i guess because so we have more options i suppose
i think so because it looks leaner and we should just go with that anyway you have all the time in the world to make to make
the final design in a minute with him so so we decided on what what did you guys wanna know again because
this is um anyway i'll fire up my thing so so we come to a decision
uh what the
ah
yeah
okay anyway uh energy we choose regular regular batteries
the chip is advanced because we have the advanced features the case it will be the material will be rubber suppose
wouldn't the b the design we talked about uh user interface type

well i think we took all the components separately what we want um let's see
um supplements i'm not sure what they mean by that anyway um
apparently you guys you should work together on the final design both on internal and external design
so
yeah you should you should probably find out how the product will fall into the market how uh what's gonna happen with the final
design as we have it now so yeah of course you've got your specific instruction as usual
so wanna spend some more um i think we're in a pretty much in agreement actually
which is good so
lef let's see where the pen go here
yeah uh open your thing again let's see what if you can come up with anything new um i'll just do a next one
so what would give us your ne your design would be the lights would be on top right uh one on each one on each side
is it is it the lights for for finding the finding remote or lights that it that

yeah i think that should just be a simple led or something like that that's not that important of course it just like a matter of a noise  a beep if you pre that you just know that that there's context so i don't think that's super important but
hmm

uh sh oh
let's see i'll just make
one light here
and just make it red now but it could be any colour so
okay whatever fine anyway what do we have here m i'll make it um are we gonna use square buttons or round ones actually
personally i would prefer round ones
yeah for
okay
okay i assume it for so we take a r take a round power button right here
whatever uh back to black
uh not too big though
see this would be good
um let's see
are these for any extra controls
okay

okay if we go for for round buttons in general do we want to the menu key in the middle to be round for example if you let's see put it this here i think we'll go with the triangles that come on
triangles are good
yeah they're a little too big now but
anyway okay so do you want for example a
round button in the middle or square one
i'm not sure uh i just just came up with it
this aligns nicely so
okay we'll just take the take the round button suppose uh oh the square button sorry

i suppose so
okay
so there's our numbers think we need an extra button here of course for yeah like you had for the
higher numbers
and you could include a button here for the mute i suppose
for something else just to
mirror mirror the effect with this that's not necessary because it you can take this away but there it looks like there's a hole there just to mirror the effect okay so we have a few
nah i think it it would be nice to put the logo here for example if you have some buttons here
we could put a logo here because it's very always in your field of vision if you're watching it the l c d  screen blah blah
well we could we could include either here
or here for example but you think here or here
i know
no we could put this one as favourite channel for exam
what are these for okay
what
you're accustomed to eleven
my uh okay have it your way i mean think this looks rather like like there's something missing for example i mean
why wouldn't you include a 'cause there is a um a piece of electronics under there
anyway so why not give it a function let's say i mean could be anything but th
no i don't think because this is a zero but you want zero to be mis aligned with the rest anyway so this is the basic design we wanna have um on and off what are we missing
if it looks um
okay so we want the remote to be the s the side view actually what i'm gonna draw so
um
probably think you want the curve to be here so have your finger under here like this i suppose okay
just gonna be sh
yeah want this straight or what let's keep it at this
so it would be like this
do we want something interesting with it or see
would give us a light here maybe it's boring you want it curved or what maybe you want
should like this
will give us design problem because we have
it can be curved okay i think so that's why i asked you
okay so
oh crap
yeah oh
anyway so you want to a little more like this
and just s s
stop the curve here or continue it
so we have our l c d  screen let's see
in
bana it's banana vision
so you have your l c d  screen right here suppose
um that would make
we use the colours now but
um

you got sponsor now you get a free one with every pack of chiquita
so it would give the buttons here
i suppose i suppose we can put um let's see
um
uh i suppose we can put the batteries in here because it has the most space for example
i don't think so because it's the biggest part of the uh of the uh
let's
i think it's possible i think it's the best place yeah you could also put 'em here but
okay so we put the batteries here

that's fine
yep blah
um any other com what what are we missing here something a speech recognition um
where do we want the microphone for example to be on the side or on the or for example on top like here
to be
okay i w thought maybe it's either be here or because it's mi it might interfere with the transmitter i'm not sure but
'cause transmitter would be here
why uh once again like you said the component can be somewhere at the bottom while we wire the microphone up there anyway
um yeah it could be either be here or make a double microphone
i wouldn't mind

it's able to talk to you
a speaker sensor
i think so it i think it could
yeah i mean it could be a all this stuff could be integrated into the l c d  screen which you could navigate with this i suppose
navigate through everything if you have i think you sh i think the advanced options should be i think it sh the
advanced option could also be integrated in the l c d  screen of course because you don't have to have a button for everything you can just navigate
through th m your menu that you have here for advanced options with this think that would be fine so that's
w m would be making use of the l c d  screen
mm
beep
um so the flashing of the beep we have well anything we could yeah but you could put a speaker or something on on the side for example
for how do you draw that again
uh whatever looks stupid
i think this is pretty
i think you have to stay here because we are supposed to five minutes to finish the meeting oh like my
the info that i got was that you're uh we're gonna work on our own because you're gonna do the market market uh
analysing i'm supposed to do the little work on the year end report so the project report
hmm okay i think we're everybody satisfied with the with the current design we have so we're s
supposed to be rubber i think well i think the the remote control is gonna be black because we we forgot to talk about i
mean the the company colours are important apparently so we have the logo up there so are we gonna base
colour is black
and yeah of course we could use yellow buttons or yellow navigation or whatever
yellow but yellow control it's
okay
well don't don't stick yourself on the covers right now
but don't stick yourself on the cover because
nah
yeah but the info i think we should go with uh with the company colour because what specific info that i got from the project board so i think we should go with that
they want something trendy
i think we should th then take it take yellow take what you c yellow remote control so let's see if if we can do the led onto it

uh oh
you know what i'm not gonna do this that's up to you guys
you doodle a doodle us a nice nice design for for the next meeting we'll be done i think we're all happy now
yeah
stupid scroll wheel

'kay
i'm not sure uh i really i'm no i have no clue what we could use the scroll wheel for
it takes space a lot of space and it could
i'm not sure if it if it has no function why even put it there and th that's just so much things that make it look flash
i think channel selection would be annoying because it just c you could scroll past the channel or
hmm
no r no scroll wheel okay um i don't see anything missing really yeah we should too bad we don't have the finance we could've
yeah it's i'm not sure if we're if we're gonna get finance anyway because i thought we cou i thought it was gonna be an issue
at the first time we started i thought it was gonna be a cost issue which material we were gonna take relative to the advanced
chips or anything so you just do whatever you like and uh doesn't care what it costs
i think we're rubber is not expensive definitely
you can make rubber in any colour in any colour so i mean you can't make yellow titanium but you can make yellow rubber
uh yeah we can make uh for example it's just something you can click on it like uh that's but it's not som not apparently that's not something we're working with in the basic design so
yeah it could be it can be done for e
well i had just a little bit of time so i hope it's something uh we can work with but
hmm
well i heard that there was a new uh component speech recognition
component which was pretty much up to standard so we might use that i put that in
my drawing but again i didn't not have that much time so
okay that's just super let me just
uh
you need to start it up first okay
okay what t
okay yeah

is that enough because i don't really see people shaking their remote control before using it
no
and what does the hand dynamo oh sorry
oh
curves being
of the remote control itself okay i was thinking along the line of one curve i'll show that in my design
so we'll get back to that
okay i t i'd go for plastic because i have a couple of curves in my design well g let's just get back to that
no wood's not an option no
yeah but it doesn't have to be unbreakable because we do need to keep selling these thing
okay well that that's definitely true
because it well ru will rubber actually protect the remote control itself because it
yeah but then you buy a new cover but rubber
okay
yeah of cour
yeah but there is a is it really necessary 'cause a normal push button can do that job
yeah but why would we use it

perhaps i have t i have two different
okay
i have two designs one including uh an l c d  screen wh which is basically the deluxe edition and then i also have a standard edition which wi we can also choose to develop too
exactly
but we'll
yep
basically it
oh i got
i got an email that it's relatively small
yes let me just

get back
well they b they basically can have speech recognition i mainly focused on the l c d  uh aspect
'cause you wanted to see them right
so this is basically the deluxe edition
i j
why is it square
it 'cause it's designy
it's basically it has some futuristic
potentially yeah i don't really know but i just thought that uh in normal remote controls you have like smooth curves and this and that and this is something new this is something different something fresh
and basically what you can see here is that it has a little yeah let's say gap which you can put your finger in
so you can you can hold it really comfortable that's basically the idea
or left hand i doesn't really matter
as you can see this is the remote control
uh you can't really see it that well but this is the l c d  screen so just imagine it goes that way
then you can see you can hold it in your left or in your right hand and i also made a
quick image 'cause i did not have that much time
of the standard edition
which has basically the keys are pretty much the same
yeah i had to do this really fast so excuse me for the uh inconvenience here but as you can see the keys moved
yeah
so these are basically the two types we have so if we were to select the l c d  screen the transmitter here you can see the light i
well we can shift that but normally as you can see there we put the uh number buttons right on top
whereas because we had the l c d  screen here we had to move them downward so what you could say is that
because these are basically the functions you use the most so if you hold it in your hand like this you put your finger in the gap this is the m most easy part
bit
for zapping cau because people are zapping most of the time
okay so that's pretty much ha which i had in mind as you can see here this can be spaced for extra keys which is the design thingys
yeah
speech recognition
then rubber would be the best as a material indeed if that is the uh
it could be a c it could be a cover but it's not our focus is the young audience so let's stick to that
yeah but that's just more a se a seasonal a trend thing the idea now
is is is that you can uh put a cover on it for example with fruit like a
shape or whatever but not 'cause a n next year it will it'll be something
completely different and then you have your apple shaped remote control which is not trendy anymore so
i think that's more something you can focus
well you can s
what you can do is smooth the edges indeed but that will bring extra c expenses
well we've got we've got like one curve here
for the gap
and we could have one here
no no no no no what i'm just 'cause you mentioned that more curves the more expensive so i'm just taking that into account
well we picked rubber right
so basically what we can do is m make these edges a little bit less sharp but the problem then is that it will start to resemble m the remote controls as we have them today we were looking at something fresh something trendy
okay
okay so that's basically silly
but isn't the f the fruit like a cover thing because we
no but
but if we put that directly into the design we limit ourselves extremely because it that's just for one seasonal trend
okay so that's well that's probabl
you'd just like it to go a little bit more like this
okay
did you present e everything you wanted to
okay
uh we still need to decide on a couple of things you you needed to know

are we all in agreement about the well the primary structure of the of my design except for the edges like the keys there
yeah
to create a kind of disco effect when you
that was basically what w
light for the finding of the remote we can also use one light for
showing that the signal is being sent but
so we have the teletext we have here we have the mute
l c d  screen this is the on off button
speech recognition i where did i imagine i did that pretty much over here so that you could use it like this
and speak to it then you have the uh extra keys for teletext mute two buttons which can be pretty much anything or nothing we can also just not use them
main controls and a key pad
will be fine
yeah but that would this was just in the design because if you i had a square design so i had square buttons but in that case the round buttons would be more appropriate
yeah the left one is teletext and the right one is mute and these two buttons are or not necessary or
yeah the triangles would be best indeed
i personally think that a round b button looks bit silly but
does everybody agree on that
you prefer a round okay

yeah you can but it but it's not necessary becau
we could put our logo there
oh that could be that b
well now it's getting a little bit too crowded up there so is your
so it can basically be the button down below or one of the four buttons up there because
one of the four is better i suppose
because it's a little bit confusing to have twelve buttons down there because you're only accustomed to eleven i'd say

oh we still need an okay button
well you could also shift the two buttons to be nicely aligned
oh we're pretty much missing an okay button but we have a button up there which is still free so
yeah pretty much
well i think it looks better curved but that's probably uh
it can be curved because that yeah it's a little bit more trendy to be curved
hmm
but it pretty much looks like a banana already uh
it's fruit yeah

or they can design their own cover
we could set up a a marketing uh agreement
won't that be a problem with the l c d  screen
yeah but the l c d  screen probably needs quite the chip
okay
okay that's not a problem okay

i think we get the idea
oh basically the idea that i had was it to be pretty much in combination with the transmitter 'cause you can talk to it like this
well the email said it was a quite a small component so i don't see that
it's a
well the
yeah but do you actually need the remote talking back
beep
at the back yeah like that or at the side
which is
so what's basically edi the editi idea sorry now we need to stay here and work out that
well i suppose we'll
pretty much
yeah but when you use covers it basically easier to have a n have a neutral colour on the base
no we're designing the remote control now but taking that into consideration it's better to have a neutral base colour than to have a flashy
it is more trendy that's definitely true
oh where would you like to put it
uh you could use it for the channels and for the volume but it's has no real added value
yeah but if it has no function then
basically out i don't see the
do you have all your answers okay
yes you can colour rubber yeah
did you manage
okay
ah hello
no just uh ask if if he could manage
i have a lot of new information
hey everything alright did you manage
okay
do you have a lot of new information do you have a lot of new information
that's true

huh
alright i have a lot of new information i have a complete list of uh everything that we can use all the components that all av available i have no i still don't have any finance information but at least we have a lot more to go on now
yep that's right
let's see where my
presentation is
okay um this i mentioned before every feature for our remote control needs to have their own operating electronic
devices we need to take care of that then warning uh there has to be a chip in our remote control and the chip requirements
uh needed for a normal button uh is just a simple chip uh scroll wheel and l c d  is
an advanced of course this is more expensive than this so we have to decide on that in a minute
the available uh components for energy are we have a basic battery a hand an uh dynamo
like in uh old torches we have a kin uh kinetic provision then you have to shake the remote control to get
the energy and we have solar cells i suggest that we uh decide on that one uh immediately then i have all lists
so
my personal uh fav favourite is the kinetic provision because uh i ha
i think so yes
yes
yes because i had the information uh you take uh the remote control you pick it up at least two times a day so then it's already shaken and gives energy
or
think
hmm
hmm

other options are solar cells hand dynamo and basic battery

only basic battery okay but i think this is not a r

yeah
yeah but i think this rules out our unit our rechargeable unit this is really a really basic battery a normal battery
huh
okay that's uh okay
okay but then we don't offer a re chargement function that's what it says
exactly alright right yep next one is curving uh we can make a model that has one curve two or three
and uh uh th uh the shape of course uh the more curves the more expensive exactly yes
hmm
hmm i think one curve is uh fine
more expensive more difficult to make
exactly and i believe even that the r the number of options we have on putting things in it
uh goes down with exactly material i have to offer a plastic rubber
wood or titanium uh if we choose plastic we cannot choose solar cells for energy if
we choose titanium uh we cannot use more than one curve
but we don't have that so fast
mm
mm
okay
no
but i think wood is not an option either
okay
hmm
okay my personal thought was uh rubber because i had an email i believe it was from you uh f against falling
hmm
okay uh
mm
yeah
mm i think we have to decide on this anyway uh because if we make removeable covers it has to be one of those mat materials we have no more than this so
mm hmm
mm hmm
okay
alright then i proceed but i need to know after this meeting so interface uh i have four
things to offer pu uh normal push buttons of course um uh we have a lot of expertise on that one we
have a large history our company on push buttons scroll wheels uh those can be pushed as well although that is more expensive
um liquid crystal colour display and um
what is this okay and if we use rubber i already mentioned that we can only use rubber buttons so rubber can only match with rubber which one of those are we gonna use push buttons that's b uh i think basic
huh
no
i think the channels
oh
yeah
huh
huh
hmm but
huh oh ah so but it looks cool mm no
oh ah flashy and yeah
i think would be cool scroll wheel it's not that much uh if we take a normal scroll wheel without the pushing then it's not expensive we can do that
think
ah we don't need it but it's uh it's design a design thing
i think they are looking for that of course we have uh a young target group so they might find that attractive in a remote con
okay so push buttons we will use uh l c d  screen
is that s
uh i only know that if we are using that we need ano uh an advanced chip in it and that is more expensive
i have no idea i have no absolute numbers i only have
yeah but i don't think room is really an issue

mm hmm okay electronics uh the first one is the chip uh that's no longer an option it has to be an advanced one now 'cause
we have the l c d  screen then we have an infrared sender i think that's basic we cannot do without otherwise
it's not s a remote control and we have the sample sensor and speaker the voice recognition thing are we gonna do that
or not
i only have uh uh relative information
oh how did you
that goes also for the scroll wheel by the way
hmm
yeah
hmm but don't we have any w uh information about scroll wheel scroll wheel if people would like that that's strange because that's the same story it's it's not necessary like an l c d  but it's just it adds something to the design
hmm
no
oh that's r
but i think uh we now already have to uh implement uh an advanced chip so it's m
no but that's that's okay
there is still time
yes this was uh the last m s  i have a clear picture

hmm
hmm i agree
hmm
hmm
no yeah uh i agree
okay agreement
mm hmm
that's true
hmm
hmm
oh that's true
mm hmm
mm hmm
but i think according to my information this would be two curves
we have one left and one right and that disables what was it again
it's some it's something that we cannot do then

okay that's not a problem that's only for the titanium we don't have
yes
then w yeah but we don't have that so we have
we have no
but they uh
they th these wha are what they call the curves this side this side this is how they count
no no this is what they uh what they mean okay that's not really a good
it's like this
hmm
hmm
hmm
hmm
yep so i can uh qui oh i can quickly make a conclusion
of what we have decided so far
hmm
hmm
me too
hmm
hmm
i would prefer round but doesn't matter doesn't matter
that's not a big deal think
hmm hmm
huh
it can be curved
yes
i would curve the whole actually
i would curve the whole like um like it hangs over your hand a little bit
then it will bounce and you don't drop it so easily
yeah something like that yes
yes exactly
i think continue like that
then there's also enough room for the electronics
yeah
let's make it yellow then uh
maybe once we can make a special edition in according with chiquita
have ourselves sponsored
uh but it's a good trade off for them if they can have their logo on it
mm hmm they might wanna be the first ones to uh
oh perhaps they can use it
or give a special edition uh with with
mm
i think this is possible
huh
it doesn't matter you can actually uh place a chip for the l c d  screen and at the bottom and and wire it doesn't matter
i think on top
mm hmm

it is i believe also able to talk
i have a sample uh sample sensor and the speaker sensor
uh the speaker sensor we already have but s i don't know what they exactly mean by a sample sensor could it talk back like uh g uh give confirmation or something
i think it can i think if you have a a speech recognition component then a s speaking component is not that hard to to put in either
hmm
hmm
hmm but
mm hmm yeah
hmm
hmm
mm
hmm
we already have a sound component by the way for the beep
so beep
hmm
i'm not sure i should be getting new information i guess
yes
but we have
any company logo we have yes but and yellow
i would change i would take a yellow remote control to have it flashy to have it it's for young people
need do be different
hmm
but we need to be different
mm hmm

huh
it's either black cover with yellow buttons or vice versa and i would say take a yellow cover and black buttons
to be different
yeah we have so many colours already
so
oh no that i think it's good thing to be different than
well
mm hmm
i still don't have my scroll wheel though uh that's nah that's true
no forget it
no look it
no that's not my point it's not because it's functional but it's just to add to the design to have it flashy it it has no function i agree i agree
oh so many things have no function just design
mm hmm hmm
mm hmm
let's vote on it then we don't have to talk about it any longer what do you want in or out
okay you are out of course you are okay clear

i have all my answers yes
hmm
hmm
hmm there is i have one question
hmm
hmm
i only have one question with the material but i don't have information that we've chosen rubber
no but can we make yellow rubber i think so
okay
mm
okay
hmm
yeah sh not quite
you will see uh
woah
yeah
mm uh nothing special uh
yeah the for uh the trendy uh stuff
a little bit i uh now will show it
okay
yeah i had the same it just uh
shuts itself down and
oh

yep
mm uh huh
i bet
oh okay

um

yeah a rechargeable maybe
re rechargeable basi
yeah
yep basic
okay
okay
but
but
it dep
but
yeah
yeah
depends on the user
yeah
yeah
no
no

are are we focussi focussing on on the
but
but
not that but are we focussing on the uh younger people or the elder people younger okay yeah that's okay nah that's



but
but th the younger people my investigation turns out that the younger people want a little bit uh material that that is uh spongy and uh
so
a sc
yeah
yeah you get

no
scroll wheel uh i don't know
yeah that's it
yeah
for the future
yeah
yep
yep
um uh
the most of them um
um uh more than uh sixty percent
yeah mean of uh seventy percent i think uh i'm i have to look it up
no
no only
ah i don't know

on the most spee
but
yeah for the future
yeah
people
ri
so only r right handed
but it but it's only right handed then not for the left or
where
wher
oh in the back okay oh yeah yeah
okay
oh yeah yeah okay yeah yeah yeah
yeah i thought it
well it it's yeah
yeah
yeah
no it maybe it's better to look uh what the people want so i can uh show my uh investigation
yeah maybe it's better
especially for young people
um where is that where is th

oh uh
yeah
mm i forgot that
okay now it must be there
yeah here it is
oh yeah
okay uh the investigation turns out that the most appear uh people want um
um uh look and feel likes is uh uh the s the same as before but it must
be w a little bit fancier than uh the the look of it um the second
important thing is um the it must be uh technol technological
uh innova vative so that's the l c d  screen is perfect i think and not uh
yeah tha that's uh very important
and a third thing is
um yeah it's uh should be easy to use so not not too much bu buttons and uh channel selection i think that's uh what you showed is uh perfect
and what the pe young people want is uh in paris and and in milan
uh it showed out that the fruit and vegetables are uh are trendy th they you s you see it in the clothes
and everything and um the contrast uh of it it must uh the the buttons
must a little bit spongy material so uh rubber i think uh th that's the best
no so we are uh we were focussing uh on the younger people so the elder yeah they wanted a little bit of wood in it and uh that's uh th that's not uh important now
yeah
yeah but
yeah
'cause uh n i i i i thought uh it makes a young uh classic remote with uh
yeah that's why i i d uh
decided
with a fruit uh
cover ov or something like that uh
yeah in in form of an uh vegetable or an uh fruit maybe
and
oh where is your
a trendy
here he here you can put a

uh maybe it
but
yeah
all uh veg uh fruit and vegetables are round so it's better
yeah
two
but it
but it's that that's for the comfort it's it's not for the trendy thing of it
yeah okay yeah
so the no
we m
form




yeah
but you can make uh if you want to use a fruit in uh in uh
uh
hey you
you can make it like
like this
well
oh
as a example but
i d
hmm
yeah
yeah
yeah
and speech w recognition are we
we
little uh voice uh
record and a uh no
yeah
form of fruit it's better
yeah
yep

and what about oh
what about a button for your uh favourite channel
uh yeah with the extra controls uh
uh one one set
yeah you have to put it up uh
one of the four uh it's better than i think
it's a favourite channel
what nee uh one of the four uh
it's better th

yeah
hmm
mm
why
yeah
uh huh
yep
yeah
perfect
yeah it's perfect


yeah
okay
top
w
on there
no
mm hmm
beep
oh
yep
okay
ah that's fine
round
wh
why
it's the colour of a
but the you
the young people want uh a trendy uh remote control so colourful uh is
yeah

you have the basic colours blue green red
oh it's okay
yeah colourful you you
yep
yeah
yeah
oh yeah
you can
ah may
but uh uh scroll for a channel s selection or volume

ma
oh okay
oh okay
out

i have to call this in a form
ah
but we ha w we don't uh use our reco uh we uh removable cover no huh
maybe maybe later maybe we can uh

yep soon as i
get this
okay this is our last meeting
um i'll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting uh and then we'll have
a the prototype presentation um
then we will um do an evaluation uh or we'll see what what we need to have
under the criteria for the evaluation then we'll go through the finance and see if we
fall within the budget
um then we'll do the evaluation and then we can finish up after that with um any changes that we'll need to make or hopefully everything will fall right in line
um let's see minutes from the last meeting um
we looked at uh the the trends we had uh the fashion trends that
people want a fancy look and feel it was twice as important as anything else um they liked fruit
and vegetables in the new styles
um and a spongy feel so we were talking about trying to incorporate those into our
prototype um they wanted limited buttons and simplicity
um then we looked at the uh the method for
coming up with our own remote um looking at other other devices um
the ipod we really liked the look of that
um we also had uh the kid's remote for a simple idea um a two part
remote which was what were were originally looking at uh and then um there was talk of
spee uh speech recognition um becoming more uh predominant and easier
to use but i think we've still decided not to go with that then we looked at
the components um
the materials for the case the different energy sources the different types of chips um and made a decision on what we were going to use to make our remote um and basically
how what were making for the prototype so i'm going to leave it at that and let you guys take over
the prototype yeah do you need a this
okay

very nice
mm hmm
what but what's that button
uh 'kay
'kay

would you like to uh
well done
well luckily we are going to find out
or not luckily um do you have a marketing presentation for us
i think it's definitely different than anything else out there so if they think that what is out there is ugly then yes i would say i would say most definitely it's bright
it still has your traditional black
yep not angular
mm
yep

yeah something more modern to go a a modern colour to go with the modern form
yeah
i would say
four
very non committal four
yeah
mm hmm
s scrolling through and selecting a few
i think that's a one

so if we incorporate speech recognition into it then it could
and it is quite bright and
uh
yeah
but if we do go with the with the speech recognition then it then our scale goes up quite a bit i think
probably two you know if we eliminate the fact that you know it's impossible to guarantee that it's not gonna be lost then
i'd say two
with the speech recognition which of course may
be changed depending on budget
which which may be cheaper than speech recognition if it were just a

some sort of proximity
pray that you don't accidentally lose that piece

okay
two
it's
but there's not a lot of yellow there's not a lotta yellow course that wasn't really we were kinda forced to take that colour
i don't know that we are that innovative to tell you the truth
if we added the screaming factor then we go up um i would say we're probably at four
we have some spongy yeah
no
yeah because it's only got what these parts are the grips and perhaps the back side the bottom the underneath on the back
probably a four at most
possibly even a five

if your fashion is b is carmen miranda you betcha
it's true
seven is
two point
two point four
something
and what what is the acceptable criteria
is there like a scale that we have to hit

alright then
okay well let's see
now we get to do the budget numbers you didn't know that you were gonna have a budget
but we do
okay
so i have here an
yeah
we want a fifty percent profit on this oh you can't really see that very well
twelve and a half euros is what supposed to cost us okay so
well let's see the f the
wonder if i can make this
what the

oh it won't let me do that
okay
alright so at top i don't know if you guys can read that or not i can't 'cause i don't have my glasses on but
so we've got the energy source there's uh four five six categories
we have energy source electronics case then we have case material supplements
interface type and then button supplements
okay so
uh first of all energy source we picked battery
um and how many batteries do we think this will probably take probably
some e either two or four
two
like it
excellent
this is consumerism alright so for the electronics our choices are simpl simple chip on print regular chip on print advanced chip on print sample sensor sample speaker
'kay we have one of those
'kay then the case is a
probably it's double curved
case materials are plastic
um i guess it's two since one for the top one for the bottom is that right or is it just one
maybe it's one because of the
'kay
i guess it doesn't matter 'cause the price on that one is zero which is nice special colour
interface type we have pushbutton scroll wheel interface integrated scroll wheel pushbutton and an l c d  display
so we actually have the l c d  display
and then is it the integrated or is it
yeah
'kay button supplement special colour um special form special material

or titanium they cost us all the same
well we only have one button so really we shouldn't be charged we shouldn't be charged anything for the the button supplements
um
okay we're gonna leave that one blank because we run on a l c d  and scroll so our total is fifteen point five
which i believe is
by three euros over

so the only thing better than um a banana shaped remote is one that you shake
yeah 'cause the
well 'cause we have to have both right
mm hmm
so we may not need the l c d  display
well there we go twelve point five
okay
so we just remove our
screen here

besides look at what the l c d  does to our lovely remote
back to the design room boys

okay so the costs under twelve point five euro was no we redesigned
it now it's yes next slide project evaluation
uh project process satisfaction with for example room for creativity leadership teamwork
means new ideas found um
so
i guess that
let's see here
i think that perhaps the project evaluation's just supposed to be completed by me but
i'd like to hear your thoughts

uh h what did you think of our project process

good
yeah i think
we st we started off a little little weak our leadership was quite weak in the beginning um um
but as the day went along we had more idea of what we were doing
um room for creativity there was that um i
think we tried a lotta different things and um
i think it was um interesting as you guys brought up more um information and studies that we were right on with a lot of those things
um you guys worked together well as a team and um the means
which was the whiteboard and the pens
i had some problem with the pen i think but minus your p
well

have a we have a list of employees that you would like fired
okay n new ideas found um
yes for the remote maybe no not f for
technology
alright closing costs are within the budget project is evaluated
um complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary that's it
and i still have to do my minutes for the last meeting
actually
um so there will probably be another
questionnaire coming up
and then we'll have to check with the main boss whether we can what goes on after that but that's the end of our meeting
can try to plug that in there but
right that's what we have there that's plastic plastic covered with rubber we might
uh add some more underneath here maybe give it give it a form i mean you're supposed
to hold it like that but um just if you grab it take it from somewhere so yeah you have some rub
yeah exactly use both might as well think about
th think about the button as well like either put either one one on either side or
not do it at all it's a quick on off button that's um
yeah i think it's pretty important so you don't have to fiddle with that
right um that's not um i'd say a bit smaller would probably be nice you wanna play with that over there there you go
right


i'd say when it comes to the ergonomics the form and stuff yes that's definitely more beautiful than your average however the colour we don't have a say in that
that has been that has been dictated pretty much by the company so uh to answer that honestly i
would rather say like uh we have not solved the problem completely with the ugly remote because
the colour is ugly definitely 's nothing you can say about that i mean i much prefer
something like brushed chrome with that form but
right
right it's different you don't want your uh
three feet huge l c d  dis display in your living room that's hanging from the wall to be controlled with something like that
yeah

yeah
it's very intuitive i think yeah
s give it a one
right
right
so that's a one
something that big and that yellow you just don't lose anymore

oops
hmm
well what
s
mm
oh yeah you probably
mm

y you could add an extra feature actually
which makes this thing
raise hell when you remove it too far from the television
we could add that but that's nothing we have thought of so far
yes
it's it's
um the it's based on this anti anti theft technology for suitcases and stuff where you have one piece that's attached to your luggage another piece that starts beeping that can't cost much
so that can also easily be integrated because these things are small enough to to hide so you have one piece you have to glue somewhere behind your stick it behind your t v  and the other
right that'd be tough then well also your remote would uh alarm you if somebody stole you t your television yeah ran off with it without taking the beautiful remote control
let's add one of those features and say yes
two
uh

it's all just
it's all just stolen technology when it comes down to right right right right
yeah not really


right
yeah well you have that kind of sort of
it's not a one though one would be the whole thing
to fold and stuff
yeah
so that's a four at most
y yes more

well the recent fashion is rather displayed in the in the l c d  and the way you operate it than the form and the colour but it definitely is

i'm impressed i can't do that without a calculator

fifty percent you're kidding p
it's too much
um
uh

battery
two
at four it's gonna be too heavy so that that's not our problem people can change it every month
they won't know until after they bought it

that's the advanced chip on print yeah
double curved yes
plastic
n no no that's just one
it's just one mo single mould we can do that
exactly right
that's not a special colour it's a specially ugly colour but it's not special
s
yes unfortunately
we could of course make the buttons wood say mahogany or so
mm hmm or titanium
uh just

yeah that's too much
it's hard to believe
so we'll go for the hand dynamo huh

i mean let's let's face it it also depends on the software on the on the television you can have the the information that this thing transmits be being displayed on the on the screen so s yeah let's take away the
yeah yeah
right
right we may not need it
there you go perfect


okay the
so we can just
take away a heck of a lot of the there you go
central oh that's just yeah
there you go oops
there you go one more criteria
fair enough
great
yeah
just half a day you have a remote there you go
super super
well that's not my fault that's obviously the people i work for uh that work for me uh they've just you know
heads are gonna roll believe me
yes yes

the prototype discussion
no
there is our remo the banana um yeah
basically we we st went with the colour yellow um working on the principle of
a fruit which was mentioned it's basically designed around a banana um but it would be held
in such a fashion where it is obviously it wouldn't be that floppy 'cause this would be hard plastic
these would be like the rubber the rubber grips so that's so that would hopefully help with grip or
like the ergonomics of it um but all the controlling would be done with this scroll wheel you have to use your imagination a little bit
and this here represents the screen where you where you'd go through
and the the simplest functions would be um almost identical to an ipod
where that one way ch through channels that way th other way through channels volume up and down and then to
access the more complicated functions you'd you sorta go you press that and go through the menus it's that that simple that just
represents the infrared uh beam
that's a simple on and off switch um i don't know we could use the voice t that blue bits
should be yellow d that that'd be where the batteries would be i suppose and um
that's about it it's as simple as you we could make it really is there anything you want to add
yeah doesn't make much make much difference you could work left handed or right handed i suppose
t the actual thing might be smaller yeah
just the on and off
yeah
it's you know it's flimsy 'cause it's made out of heavy play doh but

and whether or not it would fall into the cost everything i suppose with the scroll and the l c d 


yeah
i would
it's bright it's
it's curved it's not there's no sharp
angles to it
some people might say it yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah i think that was the main aim one of the main aims that we had
uh yeah 'cause we've we've brought it down to basically four controls most common which are channel and volume and then the other ones are just a matter of just going just scrolling further yeah
yeah it's bright yellow bright yellow's hard to lose but um if we were to if we were that the speech recognition that we could maybe just use that solely for the the finding thing that was what we'd we'd mentioned
just just to use to find it when it was lost but like i said like i don't think you'd lose something so yellow so easily and it's not gonna fall like a rectangle would slip down behind things that's gonna be a difficult shape to
yeah maybe in the middle again three or four or something
i mean you know loo losing things is one of those things that people can lose i mean a million ways you can pick it up and walk away with it and then you've lost it
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah true but i mean d just those whistling clapping key rings you have they're cheap so it can't be that
expensive
yeah
yeah
stick it on the t v 

yeah
two
i'd say so uh don't get many mo remote controls with
screens on
yeah it's stolen technology but we have
fa
'cause it's stolen no maybe not



yeah as much as as needed i think
yeah
yeah
yeah
on the
yeah
be what we were told and they'd say yeah definitely
is that some long division no

just i'm sure there's a
no i can't do long very impressive
yeah yeah so you'd been going a long time dividing that it's two point four two eight five se it just keeps going on
two point four two basically
charge about three hundred quid for it


we're advanced chip are we
yeah yeah

s
that's
yeah
and then
i'd say the integrated
mm

remote control
no that's getting a bit
tiny
yeah i'd ignore that

if it w
what if we completely took out the the one single button we've got on and just had a scroll wheel interface and the l c d  display i suppose the l c d  c  display's the one that's pushing it up a bit though
yeah
yeah
yeah you could maybe take out the l c d  dis display even if it if it comes up on the computer itsel on the t v  itself
uh that is possible yeah
there we go
screen make it a bigger dial easier to use even easier to use then



that was just we ran out of yellow
there you go even simpler
yeah for all those fruit lovers out there
yeah

i think we did yeah i think we did quite well um
yeah right from the start of the day
we sort of knew where we were going straight away i thought
yeah we've used the whiteboard



technology used
excellent




pretty impressive

kind of a banana
i do
okay you guys are gonna help me do an evaluation of the criteria
um
okay
so first i'll just discuss some of the criteria that i found just based on the past
trend reports that i was looking at earlier and then we'll do a group evaluation of the prototype
and then we will calculate the average score to see how we did
um so the criteria we're gonna be looking at are the complaints um that we heard from the users who were interviewed earlier so
we're gonna be doing it based on a seven point scale
and one is going to mean true that we did actually achieve that with seven being false we did not achieve that
okay
so for the first one we need to decide did we solved the problem of the users who complained about an ugly remote
mm

mm

yeah i think the colours detract a little bit
that's true
yeah
um okay so do you think since we
this was a a sign criteria do you think maybe we should put it somewhere in the middle then does that sound good
what do you think three four
five four is fair okay
okay the second one did we make it simple for new users
one 'kay
okay um do the controls now match the operating behaviour of the users
i'd say that
so one yeah
okay
okay um the fourth one how about the problem of a remote being easily lost one of the number one complaints
whether you want to or not you're not gonna lose it

okay
that's true
mm

annoying alarm or something yeah

so are we adding one of these
two features gonna say okay
so we're back to a one or a two two 'kay
okay are we technologically innovative
from ipod yeah
but for remotes yeah
two three
but how many remotes do you see like this not so many

really okay that's gonna hurt us okay um spongy material
'kay
and lastly did we put the fashion in electronics
i'd say we did

'kay
alright now we just gotta calculate six eight twelve sixteen
seventeen divided by s
eight

well i haven't done math in years
what two i dunno
okay we'll say two point four two
right
how does that look
it's been a while
oh no they just told me to
pick my own criteria and have you guys evaluate it basically
so that's that

oh my god okay
yeah we'll go with that
not too shabby

right
oh
bright yellow



it'd look really lovely yeah


leave it blank



perfect





what's the blue part oh that's the batteries okay

looks more like a banana



trying to fill in some time there
good teamwork


minus your powerpoint fiasco
no i know i'm yeah incom

mm kinda

we might have a while though
right so
start of the first meeting uh
right so agenda of the first meeting where we uh
we have twenty five minutes for this meeting we uh are to
get acquainted so does everyone want to say who they are
that seem sensible
and i'm alastair and i'm the project leader alright okay so tool training um
project plan so does anyone have any uh thoughts
as to the tool training that uh is required
neither am i
oh i see so we shouldn't really be
oh right okay so so we have the project team which is to um basically to come up with
a new r remote control device uh we have uh the starting
base was the original which has been in existence now for a period of time
and uh our idea is to uh
to make the new remote control device uh more user friendly than the previous one and to
to be trendier to be with it and therefore to uh to get a bigger market share
and bigger audience so um method of doing
this is uh split up as you can see into uh
the functional design the conceptional design and the detailed design so um

in each of these uh phases we'll uh basically be handing over to yourselves the designers of this uh
this device and uh having uh meetings so that we can uh during the course of the day um come up with a
better better inst implement than we had before and therefore um have a successful uh conclusion to the day um
and you'll be doing uh various designs uh throughout the day to meet
this end so we've got tool training try out whiteboard uh
so we will um right so everyone's to uh supposedly uh draw their favourite
animal over on the white board over there i guess this is uh make sure the whiteboard works
so uh i don't know who wishes to go first do you wish to go f have a first
bash at uh whatever
ah uh
but now you you uh you'll move out from the microphone and the camera i take it that
i would i would guess so or
technical problems i mean you designers are meant to come up with these sort of things

next
i don't see as there's any need to there's plenty of space i mean whatever
exactly
we've had more time to prepare over this side so we've all stuck our bits and pieces in our pockets
the three pens are underneath
you get marks for artistic impression
so you're just doing the face



right um well i've not actually had too many pets
uh over my uh time 'cause to be honest with you uh
i'm not too keen on them anyway not to worry so what my daughters have got at the moment is they've got uh
a few fish and so hopefully um won't prove too difficult to draw uh
as you can see that my artist artistic work is useless as well anyway um
and uh one of the best uh things about fish is that they don't really take uh
too much looking after because uh with most of the animals if you're going away on holiday or whatever
you've gotta spend money or get a friend or whatever to look after them for you whereas if you got fish
you just gotta put the food in a a a dripper feed which feeds them over the uh couple of weeks that you're away and uh
change the water every couple of months and buy in a few plants so other than the fact that they keep
dying uh fish are uh are not are are are reasonable pets
in that uh they're low maintenance
right
okay uh if we're still all with us right okay so
work has been done on uh
this uh project where by um twenty five euros
is uh the uh expected uh selling price that information has come from
our marketing manager here so
we're looking to sell internationally not just in europe we're looking at um
having our production costs limited to uh twelve and an half euro per unit
and therefore making a profit margin of uh well not actually a profit margin it's
uh because obviously you're gonna have overheads and various other costs to uh take
uh from uh
from that to give you your profit margin per unit
and so depending what the uh the overhead uh costs are will determine uh how many units we're uh looking to sell or projecting to sell at this point in time so um
experience with remote control first ideas new remote so i guess
we're looking at um having a discussion at this point in time to help
uh you um folks design our our new model as it were
so uh any any thoughts
okay so so basically we're looking for some um we're looking for a device that is um robust and
and therefore uh won't get damaged too easily um we're looking for a device
that is uh what was the other things you said there
easy to use
use
and see okay uh
mm hmm
oh i w um basically i'll get back to you on that but it seems to me sensible 'cause as you rightly said there's nothing more annoying than having three or four devices littered about the uh about the room and uh
so a device for
for all remotes
hmm
but is it in a sense it's r um mutually exclusive you can't have both the th the one
device and then have few buttons on it to 'cause you want you want simplicity
as well you want any idiot to be able to use it whilst at the same time you want
as you rightly said one remote for all
and so these are probably mutually exclusive options that
uh hmm you could argue that experience of using
devices and similar devices as people get more and more used to using remotes therefore they're more with handling them therefore you can
make them more complicated as time goes on
better instructions
mm hmm
okay um well we've got five minutes before the end of the meeting so uh we have to uh start winding up um is there next meeting in thirty minutes
so um
right so we've got i d  the come on where's my

oh there we go yeah that's what i was looking for right so we've got function
oh what happened to the
right
right sorry about that okay so we've got um the working design
for i d  for u i d  the technical functions design marketing the user requirement specification specific instructions will be sent to you by your person by your personal coach so
are we all clear what objectives we're looking to meet in the next thirty minutes and i guess i'll try and write up some minutes of uh this meeting to uh to give it to you for the next meeting
television remote control
that's true 'cause during during the course of our day we might make decisions based on information
or meetings that would change where we're going but at this point in time i think you're right that
uh shall we make it just a t v  okay so we
will depart we will stay here and uh and break off and i'll do
minutes and and we'll see you in half and hour okay
right s
okay
i'm nick i am the industrial designer
tool training

yeah
yes

okay
you've lost uh your microphone there



okay yeah i'll i'll

shall i see if i can get across without just tangling everything
okay there's one
didn't think of that
'kay uh pens are over here i'll try the red pen
okay um i'm gonna go for the bear which i'm be able to draw very well but
i'll have a bash at it
uh

ooh ooh i lost it there i think i've just knocked the microphone um
we'll g then we'll go for a a s small small bear

um and i like my animal that looks nothing like a bear because um
i dunno maybe because there's so many cartoon characters made up after the bear like the jungle book characters and stuff like that great






yes
um i with some remote controls the buttons were a little small so they're quite hard to press so maybe we make something with uh
easy to press buttons as that is the main function
yes
um sort of easy to use so the buttons are accessible
is easy to use and see
yes


sorry you go you go

yeah
yes
yeah
maybe we could um have better instructions with the remote or are we just doing the design of the remote control itself or sort of the instructions that would come with it
'kay
or not
slide four
okay

yes
'kay yes
i think you just said at the start it was a television remote control so maybe we should just stick to that unless we get told otherwise
'kay
okay that's great
i'm louisa i'm the user interface designer
i'm not exactly sure what you mean by tool training


i don't mind
um
let's see good job i got pockets today
are we supposed to do this right now do you think or
oh
right here we go
okay i think that i would have to say that my favourite animal is the cat
little smiley cat there
um and this would be
because they're very independent uh they're very intelligent compared to dogs maybe um and they can be very very affectionate some people don't think so but i know very affectionate cats um
um and they can look after themselves

shall i rub that out actually







that's quite good


can i just check is this just a television remote because a lot of um
systems are kind of t v  video combined now or t v  d v d  combined and one of the most annoying things is having like five remotes in the house so if you've got a combined system it could be a combined remote
or is it just a television that we're supposed to be doing


comes to your whistle


i think that might be back to the start um if you grab the kind of uh slide to the left and pull it down
i'm not exactly clear on what we're designing the rem remote for is this a mun multi functional one or do we decide that ourselves as we go away and work on it
right
okay
mm hmm
yeah
i'm robin i'm the marketing manager

mm hmm okay


i dunno

your microphone's just
yeah i don't know


we can have have a whole menagerie






right
hello um i'm gonna go for the dog and i'm gonna draw one badly as well uh
looks like it's going to be a dachshund or something

right there's my dog um i like dogs because they're very loyal and they're always happy
so whenever whenever you're feeling sort of a bit a bit down or tired they're always coming up and they're always um
quite excited so um you can always have a lot of fun with a dog and they're also good for exercise
as well you can sorta get out and they they sorta never get tired and and when they're tired they're quite cute as well so
okay that's why i like dogs


great
mm hmm
yeah
mm
yeah
i've
okay yeah um one of the things um we found from the market research is that people often get confused
by the number of buttons on them as well 'cause there's quite often lots and lots and um
sometimes uh they sort of remote controls defeat their own purpose because you're
sat in the chair and the remote is somewhere else in the room so whereas in the past you'd have to get up to change the channel
now you have to get up to sort of pick up the remote so so i don't we need to sort of maybe think about how
um we could maybe uh develop a remote control which moves around the
room i don't know
that's that's maybe something for the future when you can talk to your television but
yeah
yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah
i mean
we've done some research um about sort of you know what the cutting edge sort of hand held devices
are and a lot of them sort of use you know they're like they're like mini laptops so it's possible
that we could devise a system where where you're you're basically sort of holding a a miniature computer which is controlling
all your your sort of your television your stereo and where you know if you buy a new thing
then it sort of you can link it to that as well maybe
okay
if you just click return it should be okay it'll get rid of the message
if you hit just hit return and it should get rid of the message
oh you've got
yeah
yeah

mm hmm
mm hmm
okay cool
okay cheers

yeah yeah we'll go we've got the mailing lists out now isn't isn't it so it's everyone should know about it now
yeah so so everyone on that list has now being reminded yeah don't store anythi anything sensitive on yeah don't store anything you you care about on the machines so
yeah with the yeah i mean i di i di i did do hard dri hard drive check um and a memory check
and it says there's no uh there's no problems but something caused it to go wrong in the first place so we don't know we don't
know we'll just fingers crossed and hope ho yeah ho hope that all this is just a software thing that we can just fix like that and
that'll be it
yeah yeah
yeah i mean there's there's so what we yeah one one for one one we'll try and get done today yeah get get windows back on there try and get camtasia on there and get that tested out and then that will be i think that's everything we need f before we can before you can start running the experiments isn't it so
yep
yep
yep yep uh but uh yeah no i have to manage to get at things working on on monday
so that that everything went down like on the tuesday morning um so my m i should get everything working on the um yeah on monday
so sure that the j c t  is actually working collaborating collaborating between the two machines um i had dinner i wasn't actually at dinner
but i d have the eye tracker stuff working 'cause it was just me running roun running round the lab um still have to once it's re installed have to actually do a proper
p yeah of proper pilot and yeah yeah but um but it loo it looks like it was doing all the calibration
and drift correction things that s ellen was wanting on it so so that don't think there's anything to add to the software for that part
um
don't think so mm
don't s don't sound don't sound familiar

yeah yeah so i'll try and try and get camtasia up and running so i can try it out when when when we've got her coming in and we'll just sort of do a run through of proper pilot just to just just so i can see th
yep yep um yeah i'll make sure make sure they can actually pick up the f um audio signal as well uh so but uh it should be the yeah the audio signal should be coming out the speakers once it's set up properly so that should that should make that slightly easier

yeah yep uh but yeah so they're fortunate have speakers o on the monitors inside the room so
as long as and what we'll have done is just gonna set up so the uh whatever the asterisk sound is on windows is what
gets played so so just change sound to whatever you like just go through the windows control panel
yep yeah so i'll i'll have that running over the weekend um so la last week i tried it with a one kilo hertz sound um
and it was it c it could detect it but it wasn't but but it wasn't very clear did it with ten kilo hertz and it's just really
clear where you can tell exactly where exactly where the beep is now so yeah so tha it's ju just a matter of um
yeah you just ba basically just play it just play a ten kilo hertz sound over the over the speech and then just um compare the two signals
basically um so i've i've got a little script for doing it so so yeah
yeah yep yep not a problem
yep yeah the the one the one in just installed should have that now um we'll double we'll double check and re install on software on the on the um eye tracking machines but yeah it should uh should be updated without any
so
yeah so so so we've got like uh a big circle with a white circle in the middle of it for an eye and we got like a rectangle with two like rectangle buttons on it for a mouse
so
uh no they're they're they're the same size as the as the original blobs basically but um so they uh yeah i think the mouse is slightly bigger but it's not you know it's not it's not hugely bigger so
yeah and if it ever ever gets to be a problem in the pilot i can easily reduce the size of whatever 'cause that's not too hard so
yeah
yep
yeah
uh i'll try it

yeah yeah so so you can you can do it in x  fig export them as s v g  and you just get a you just get a list of x y  coordinates um and then i'll just write in a little script that turns those x y  coordinates into a part
well the thing is it's s v g  so so long as i've got something that will output s v g 
yeah yeah so i'll als i'll also have a look have a look at that but the there's there must be plenty of windows things for th that i o output s v g  min uh i kno i know i know
um i kn i know adobe and things have faculties that do it but obviously they're like a few hundred pounds um so oth but other
i i'd b i'd be very surprised if there wasn't a free package for doing it um i ha i have a feeling that the um
amaya the w  three c  browser does it have a feeling that that can actually edit s v g  files
yep yep
yep fair enough

yeah um when will yeah but no i'll i'll create a c i'll create a convex part um just so next week um ju yeah but it just it it
just just happened to be a convex part that i was that i was i was playing with so it it handled that fine um it didn't have any self intersections
so that might be a problem so i'll just have to have check that but
yeah by by a by a part of it crosses over itself um s so it's sorta like a b

yeah that sort of thing yeah so
yeah if if it if it becomes a yeah
yep yeah so for now we'll just just assume that non interse non intersecting um and um
yeah and then there's this at the moment the e the s v g  stuff can output ones which aren't closed polygons but um ones
ones you ones that actually had turn up into parts list uh it creates a closed polygon by linking the l end point to the start point
so so uh yeah so as long as long as they're yeah so so so as long as they're
they're drawn well enough it should be alright so um but yeah
suppose let nijmegen uh find their find their own s v g  sort of find something that does s v g  and then we'll see if there's any problems
yeah yeah
yeah
but it mi it might be worth just checking what software they are using 'cause it might crea it might create outputs slightly different from x  fig so


yeah
that should that should be fun yeah i think it does s v j  uh s v j  output um so i'll i ca i can easy double check if uh nijmegen can't find anything so


yeah yeah
yeah but other than that that was easy enough to install though wasn't it it was yeah
copy and paste the stuff out the off off the wiki so
yeah yeah i mean uh also double checked in that we're not gonna w could access the c v s  from home when i was working from home
last last week um on thursday i managed to managed to get in and just just check the stuff and make sure it was all make sure th make sure ma make sure i could
access it so they shouldn't have any trouble accessing it once they've got the log ins so
not yet i'm afraid



uh well on once uh once i've tried out the camtasia stuff i'll see if the if there's any problems gonna tr gonna try and fix them if there isn't any problems
next time i'm working on this uh g d f  stuff um so so i've i've i pu uh put on a d t d  and
a sample x m l  file on the wiki for the g d f  so it's ba based on some stuff you put on there on the g d f  specification
um
yeah i mean with i cha i changed a couple of things from your original draft um so there's not uh there's no longer a separate thing for creating new parts so just put a start and end time on each part uh so
so the the you you you had a you had a thing call i think it's mould or so or something that you said which is sort of to create a new part
there's an action to create a new part um but i th uh i've i gave each part a start time and an end time um so you can see
when the parts were created so i'm not su so i'm not not sure if you wanna keep the mould or not uh
yeah but it's it's just the g d f  specification page on the uh on the wiki
i've uh i mean i'll try try to put in justification for for the change that i made uh on the page so um but i've i've sent it out for review so that s anyone who is gonna using the format can have a look at it huh

right yeah yeah yeah mind when the
yeah well the ones that this stuff i mean is it's helpful it was helpful for me to putting it up on the wiki 'cause i could actually thin think about it as i put it up and say well this is this is why and th this is why i wanna do things this way um so
yep yep
yep fair enough fair enough
yeah
yeah
mm

well uh well i kn i know on camtasia if you got a ca if you've got a camtasia project you can have the video and audio stored separately in which case

yeah so yeah so so we just ended the just ended the the dutch stream yeah the video and our audio and then they can easy create their audio out of mm from that outp
yeah yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah well one thing uh one one thing that camtasia can do you can have little videos when other haven't gotten got any cameras for doing that but you could like have videos of people click on the mouses and sorta or whatever else mm hmm

you can do yeah you can generate call outs and whatever so the might yeah i'm sure there must be a way of putting big arrows ov or whatever um


oops

no i'm an af afraid not
i wouldn't know no no no that's a s that's psychology thing how hard they



yeah yeah so this yeah yes yes he'll he'll just be working with robin on what analysis we need to get out of the g d f 
format um so i'm gonna c basically i've got a the gest analyser's the base the basis for
uh um ascii to g d f  converter um so what i'm gonna do is actually create an output uh a g d f 
output part to it um 'cause at the moment uh only outputs the video um but it does have internal structures will just make it
easy to do the the x m l  so so that's that's what i'm gonna look at and then once i've done that i can look at the whatever
analysis we need to get done out of the g d f 

yep
yeah yeah
yep



yeah
um i think that's it and i'll t uh yeah i'll get get working on the camtasia stuff this week and then so once uh once uh once we've got some some idea about what analysis you want out of this i can think about whether g d f 's got everything we need in it um and f yeah what analysis we can pull out of it
yeah yeah so i'll i'll double check the g d f  specification against that just to make sure it's got everything you said that you'd you say you need from that list um

yeah
yeah

yeah
yeah
yeah 'cause they i mean we w we got all this in the ascii format at the moment and it's just a matter of what data do we need to pull out of that into the g d f 
so i can actually do the proper analysis um 'cause i think all the answers are gonna be run off the g d f  format 'cause 'cause
we've decided that if we went and looked well if we're looking at dynamic reasons and whatever else it has to be g d f 
yeah which is yeah which is why we have to do it off the g d f  as as opposed to the e d f  format so
yeah yeah so so the g d f  it's got yeah so it's it's got uh the all th the stuff on the um e d f  so it's just
the uh the ascii file the things like the mouse movements and things like that and then yeah yeah and then on top
of that g d f  can also it will also have information such as right at this point in time they were looking at the new parts area
or they were looking at the target yeah um so yeah so the the g d f  is gonna have that sort of
information in it and then also 'cause it's x m l  file we can then do x s l t  or whatever on to it to get extract whatever
bits of data you need for yeah for for whichever bits of analysis you're trying to do from it so



yep


okay yeah i mean m my view on this was that um the need
for people to back up their data personally was made sufficiently clear to lab users um i mean i guess
right okay as long as she admits it then then that's fine i i'm just thinking you know sometimes when there's a a process
error like that you think oh then there's something we should change like make the sign in bigger red letters but i in the our case i don't
think there's anything more we can do really so um well i doubt anybody'll do that again 'cause that'll get
around so
yeah there was a mailing list before they've just revived that right
right okay
uh huh
right and we don't know so there's every chance of this falling over again if it's a hardware thing right but there's not much we can do about that apart from
right
yeah why is uh huh yeah yeah
uh huh
yeah so how long does this put you back for is it you know how much disruption does this cause d is this a day two days day and a bit yeah uh huh
to actually do the re install you c
mm hmm and i saw uh a bunch of stuff about software updates that's un unrelated to this problem right um the eye link i c i didn't read 'em i saw like five messages go back and forth maybe they were under the wrong subject header
so anyway we have well
oh no i mean the eye link software
so it's unrelated it's not that right okay good um
yeah so uh i uh did he get his data in or is this put his schedule back
he's done it okay
right um well unfortunate but it sounds like um you guys are well placed for dealing with it so better you than me

yeah
oh so you need to borrow somebody's head and mouth and stuff to to run it right and
yeah
mm hmm so i've got a new um trainee who might need amusement at some point so if you need to borrow a head
that talks that doesn't necessarily need to do much else i'll th i'll ask her if she'd mind coming down and helping you out
for uh a while but i guess ellen was gonna be your the p the person who yeah your spare head
right
yeah so um uh mine is well she's actually climbing ben nevis today i think but uh she'll be uh back tomorrow her name's nynke did you guys meet her

this seems the sort of thing that people might might find i find amusing to look at so um i i'll i'll see if if she'd be willing to
oh who is that oh yeah heidi oh yeah she's good you guys might actually have something in common 'cause she does well you know stuff for the video coding and gesturing
and autism but
so okay
uh right what am i writing uh okay nynke to volunteer
well uh no uh i will actually give her the the option but um it sounds like the kind of thing where
you know i think it's quite useful when you're at that stage to see the different kinds of technologies people use so
yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
oops well you found that then
right
okay so we want one you can pick up using matlab or something right aye
okay perfect
perfect so or you're gonna bank the script some place and tell us how to run it uh huh 'cause we won't know right well that all sounds good
oh really oh okay
uh huh okay very nice very pretty it doesn't get in the way of seeing what's underneath
version one mm hmm
it's not too bad uh huh i c i can i can see where that's useful no
just change it mm hmm

yeah although if if you had a big thing and it was jiggling around like anybody's business like real eye track traces then you might find that a little bit disconcerting i mean small things you kind of expect to jiggle around right but
it'll look like it's quivering you know yeah but well that's all fine
what else
you were saying joe with the model builder
oh remind me oh yes okay
oh that's good
oh okay
really
just the parallelogram

right okay so you your job in this is to um ensure that it actually is a bug and then
pass it to joe okay that makes sense i mean the this geometry stuff is really
tricky if you don't do the fold the boxes stuff in your head well so i can imagine 'cause i could get it backwards
easily you know and so it is just as well for w for you to check this
uh huh yeah yeah
yeah so you need to draw 'em in something oh so yeah i suggested you do that in x  fig is that a reasonable thing to do or no
yep mm hmm
yeah so this is this falls down completely if nijmegen can't run x  fig so you better check that with 'em right
but
okay but they may need help finding the something if they can't do x  fig i suppose
microsoft though i mean well what kinds of
they are the paid yeah and
uh huh
yep mm hmm
okay so i wouldn't do any any work to find out what'll output s v g  just ask them look you
know say we you need something that does s v g  and then um if they if they come back and say ha
then y you may need to poodle around a bit looking for something but uh you know let them let them say
they've got a problem before you um spend time trying to figure out what'll do it 'cause
uh huh yeah yeah
oh so well i can imagine there being uh shapes that you could construct in s v g  format that would fox the model builder in some way i don't know i mean it 'cause you don't have specs about what sorts of shapes are allowed right
um right it doesn't matter whether they're um convex or concave in funny ways
yeah ex
and you tried it yeah yeah yeah
would we want by self intersection you mean you could
you mean like
yeah yeah yeah
well but by self intersection here i'll draw here if i can find the right end of the pen y do you mean something like that yeah a and you can rule out something like that right 'cause that's two parts for you
yeah um i mean you know some f rainy day you might wanna think about
well i don't know i mean it you know later on we can fix it if it if it turns out those parts it's not urgent now i think this isn't important enough yeah
yep mm hmm mm hmm
uh huh
yeah but but but if they have trouble you know half an hour googling and helping helping
them is probably worthwhile 'cause someti sometimes people i mean it actually i would e i wouldn't expect them to have any trouble finding something 'cause
j p  is quite up with all the all these things so um are th
well you let's um encourage them not to use um any software that might have idiosyncratic ideas
about what s v g  is she says delicately i have no
ooh that i wasn't gonna say i i have no idea whether they have idiosyncratic s v g  output or
whether but um their track their track record could uh on some of the other standards has not there have been slightly
strange things about it so um but in my uh you know i mean
they sh that should be if
mm hmm
um yeah i haven't looked through other mail i did see something from marloes is there anything they're waiting on from us that is a problem or i they reasonably happy at the moment
oh they've done the pilots oh good

dumped the data where is it dumped
b s c w 
well that's okay you know we're not using that much space if it's just for interim and they have to get out to us some way um uh we
had a uh brief discussion just before i left about uh this idea of exchanging data by fire wire
drive and i do i don't know if that ever got resolved but you know
that's not that's not fast enough for little things like this so i think b s c w  is the right way to exchange these we just have to wipe this stuff off
and keep separate copies after that
the c v s 
oh so you're managing that okay and you haven't run into c v s  before okay well good
yeah yeah yeah
well that's that's reassuring
course he's sitting on the next desk
mm hmm
yeah well she'll have to u use the c v s  eventually 'cause we don't really have a good way of doing this otherwise but
mm hmm
well that's it we'll never see him here again watch i'll find out he's got a better computer at home as well right
right and what about um the project as a whole is there anything that ruud or anybody is after that we aren't supplying not at the moment right
they're they're critical the to the success of a project so
y uh yeah and general places but yeah i wouldn't worry too much about it unless they ask you for specific input yeah
that's what's circulating
uh huh
oh yeah
mm hmm and john's going mm hmm oh that's good
he'll be useful for the w p  seven stuff so
well while you do that i'll be trained in how to hire people so
uh both so
so is there anything else what have you got on for the rest of the week besides getting this stuff up and running again
yeah
right so are you concerned about it that i should be looking at it or you happy with it i mean i sort of wrote the initial draft of it i suppose so
um uh slower
uh huh
okay
um i'll have to look i can't remember um how this works now 'cause it was a while ago
so
yeah and you'll get nothing back unless i look at it right so i best for for us for me to do that i i
um yeah i i mean it's really good that you're y um putting things out for for
review and saying like why for stuff but um we don't we also don't want um to
burn too much of your time recording stuff that that nobody's ever gonna look at necessarily
so i mean this this might be a good case for or it might uh or it might be that you should just like
you know talk to me about this stuff if i happen to be around at the time that you're doing it and not y so i
if the writing stuff down on the wiki gets to be too high a proportion of things then then you don't necessarily
wanna do it you do you know what i mean the so um i th i think it's great to have the records and
that's really important especially in in big dispersed groups but this is kind of a smaller group
um so it you know we can do things more informally where f you feel the wikis are getting in the way of things so
oh yeah it well if it aids you in thinking to write it down then definitely write it down 'cause yeah we want clear thinking um i can't actually remember uh i how it worked with the the moulds i mean i w i wanted to make sure that um
no i can't even remember so i'll i'll look at it uh but uh i'm sure it's fine 'cause um it's just my memory of things
oh yeah uh huh
yeah so um is that gonna have a voice over or is it we had discussions before you started
about whether it should be completely silent so that they could use in case we ever wanted to do this
in in dutch yeah and uh and so you know you could just have sort
of well the i think we discussed having it with an english voice over or having it with no voice over
and then having it w just with cartoon noises or something like or you know when things break so to emphasise the
i may be imagining it
oh so we could produce a dutch voice over for the same thing yeah
yeah
yeah
okay the oth the other issue is um uh i if we do a voice over uh does that affect the language that the people choose to use s so that might be another reason for not doing that
alignment or you know
yeah so i think maybe that was another reason for um just having
or or or ding for you know you got it or i don't know what
yeah yeah yeah well that y
yeah well you need some way to make sure that they actually notice the thing you're trying to explain to them if there's no voice uh
or or you could just point to you know have b great big arrow that points at the two pieces that broke

you know and
yeah so you gonna clear or r however you do this with ellen right 'cause she's the one that has thoughts about the language and stuff
oh well remin remind her that there was a question about whether there oughta be one
mm hmm
i bet marloes just talked to 'em
ah i think it's really up to us to
is it hard you don't wanna give 'em the specification you know 'cause that's in too high falutin a language but um oh i it can't be that hard to generate something that says

mm hmm
oh um uh on my holidays we encountered a children's toyshop where there we there were tamgrams
and my son reminded me that he ca hasn't been able to find his tamgram set in a while
well uh if not if you guys are using it or do y do you find it helpful to have it
oh but it's so tactile to have the little metal bits if you if you're using it keep it he's got plenty of toys if you're not if you're not using it then i'll take it back
yeah y it's not it's not a worry the the lad has plenty of toys
oh similar types uh huh
yeah
right so um how you gonna get your complexity ratings google
is there a big tamgram community that ranks these things like you know that's just one booklet that came with one set of tamgrams
or or is it obvious like when you look at these things
yeah but that still won't tell you well how many tamgrams are there that they're using fifteen or something no not even
uh huh so that's not gonna g so that's not gonna tell you anything about relative complexity that's just gonna tell you where in the span you wanna be you still need some kinda scale for these things ca uh if you look at 'em do you just know
no i would either what about him i if h mister geometry i mean you know can you tell just by looking at these how hard people find them or right okay well

who is psychology already uses tamgrams that's still around mean people have been using tamgrams for ages so there must be somebody with a folk wisdom you can contact
right i only know ancient papers so like late eighties
do people still use tamgrams
oh so we're very old fashioned
well there was stuff in the seventies and the eighties right so since then right well the old the old tasks are the best so i'm not gonna let that worry me
um
so uh sorry that was k i think a big diversion and we were talking about what you were gonna do next after all this
stuff was up and the i was gonna look at the g d f  spec are the rest of the y uh are is the rest of what you're to do
with that software fairly clear 'cause this is about the analysis you really only need robin
right to to specify the rest
uh huh
yep mm hmm yeah
yeah 'cause there were all these issues about how you calculate eye eye lag and you know w what other th analyses
we want o want out of this that aren't settled but i think um you know robin is
the person who knows the most about what's required there and i can imagine it's gonna take a wee while to
i can imagine you know so that might be the focus of discussions next week or something right that um what need
out of this and
yeah so you might wanna try and come if you get that far try and come equipped with a list of the kinds of things you want out of it and and
so we can look through and see um uh y ellen might have views on what kinds of things once we have a list
right so so yeah so but it'd be good to you know make
sure once we have a list of the things that we think we're getting of it that it matches her intentions for what we were supposed to get out of it
so um you know if we do talk about that then it might be nice to have her along for it
oh yeah
oh yeah who is that then
'kay um are they still in the business
where are they
okay well they might have the folk wisdom on the complexity right so ninety two's not that long ago
well it is really but
um is it a paper you can get
well they still do it for library loans and stuff so
uh huh yep
so do we think next week that's what we're gonna talk about 'cause we want wanna ask ellen ahead of time if she wants to come along for a discussion about oh well that's that's fine then
okay oh yeah c she 'cause she her stuff is getting blocked off the mailing list 'cause she's not mailing from her normal account
yeah and i can't figure out any way to just approve messages from her without her subscribing at that account so
um
there's only one message so far it didn't say much uh
yep anything else
yeah bu i don't think that list is our final word on things and
oh well maybe it is then
i
uh huh i don't think i was fully paying attention to that i mean i'm not gonna have views on this anyway what i'm really worried about is making
sure that um there's not big surprises for ellen and and j p  you know when they suddenly discover
that they're they're assuming some analysis is in there and we didn't didn't put it in you know 'cause now
is the time for us to be figuring out what we want out of that data and and getting you write the stuff or getting j p  to write the one dimensional
analyses that he was talking about so
oh right okay so y actually you're breaking this down into two steps now one is just a straight extraction from the ascii and the other one is any post analysis that that adds information by analysing it is that th
yeah it's just anything that's got shoved through the eye tracker yeah
yeah yeah okay that is post analysis yeah so right yeah
mm hmm yeah
oh well that all sounds good
so
i've got o uh one thing to check and one person to ask if she'll volunteer to be a head and as far as i know
that's it for me see i have to explain i'm for for one of my other things i there is
now a specific wiki page that says stuff jean has to do and i'm beginning to think that this is
quite a good idea 'cause i worry about not doing the stuff people expect of me much more than the other way around right
what documentation
oh okay
well it doesn't actually make its way into its my salary i'm afraid so
but yeah i mean i do spend time talking to you guys so you're getting something out of me
uh yeah so we've moved over and onto the other eye link so uh 'cause she's running at the moment

she did admit it yes uh huh

hmm no
but ma
yes shock and worry at uh i think yeah there's a there's a mailing list uh
and mm hmm yeah uh f frank went through it deleted the people
that were have gone or or whatever and replaced them so the the eye the the list is now updated
mm hmm
mm hmm yes uh
mm hmm
hmm
yeah we're doing a bit see last week by the time everything and and then it'll be hopefully no more than i don't know what twenty minutes today to
hmm
yep
i i yeah you mean from was that joe or is that
um there was nothing nothing over last week joe has uh produced another version of the
uh model builder and put that up uh well that wa that was ruud well a few weeks ago but yeah
yep it's unrelated
and was r was running 'cause frank did all that because he then had an experiment so he's run an experiment and it's all worked
uh he's he's done his and got his and yes and he backs up anyway
maybe too well placed yeah
yep

wh a spare head or uh yes but she's not around so uh

nynke mm hmm
mm well i did meet uh uh uh uh someone from another project of yours on wednesday evening it was hei heidi who is the gesture of autism yeah mm hmm
mm yep
and autism yeah
yes sh she's been volunteered
yep make sure it uh it starts and finishes when it's meant to and that sort of thing as well
mm hmm uh yep
uh yes with the um the bleep was a hardware bleep originally and so it comes from the p c  which is outside
the sound proof box
yes
h mm hmm it comes through the
yeah yep

mm hmm no
uh um what else you have altered the um task programme because uh to put the um little eye icon and the mouse uh to make it
rather than just a blob uh ellen wanted something to look more like an eye so that you knew that was the eye there was like yeah mm hmm

want it a reasonable size so that if they're looking at it we know they're looking at it though so you has to be a a reasonable target uh for the for the tracking purposes

mm hmm with large mm yeah i suppose the larger more oscillation appears that um it's not w i mean uh it isn't it isn't it isn't that big so yeah
uh yes he's produced an another version that doesn't uh have the overlap problem
you know there was the yeah the collisions the polygons now don't overlap um
marloes discovered something strange about the orientation of parallelograms from when
it was constructed to when it appears in the um actual task but i think that might
be something to do with the original configuration than the parts that weren't the same across the two
so i'll check that out uh to see if it really is a problem or not
and basically the parallelogram was appearing in a sort of as a mirror image of what it was like in the
uh model builder in the actual yeah just total it flipped uh in in a mirror image not
rotated so it wasn't anything to do with rotation it was f yeah just the parallelogram so
uh entirely sure must be some way of how the vertices were described or uh defined in one way
or compared to something else
joe yep
well uh mm hmm yes uh
the other thing we've done is uh looked at n not uh for this current experiment but for future
when we've got to build um bizarre parts like air craft wings and and things uh something like
x  fig uh can output the vertex points um
for creating the air the actual polygons in the first place 'cause the model builder um assumes
that there's an existing set of of original parts so you need to draw them in the first place so
it it i yes
w or something i i uh uh
yeah so it must be a some sort of pink package uh
yeah

yeah
yeah and it's not it's not an immediate problem anyway but i thought it was worth before joe disappears just checking that the model builder's not restricted to just doing the tamgrams or something tha you know so uh no it does look like it's uh m s n 

um no but as long as they're solid polygons it should be alright
uh no it sh well uh uh hopefully that's not what the parallelogram problem is because it it does have sort of sum of angles and things but uh no as far as uh i mean it
mm hmm yeah
or part of it was convex yeah
i y yeah but that's why uh we no we'll only be working as i say with sort of solid obvious polygons and as parts 'cause they'll have they'll have to have a central point anyway for for rotation and and grabbing but
mm hmm
well uh uh realise what we're i would consider that two parts yep
yeah yep
the last point to the yeah
yep
yes yeah
j p  is quite yeah uh huh

yes the microsoft version of s v g  or something yes uh huh
i have no idea either uh
nope uh i think they've um they're not waiting anything from us uh
they've dumped the pilot the pilot studies that they generated based
on the task with their english participants or english speaking participants yeah uh but they haven't
done anything with it other than dump the data uh they well they dumped it on the
mm b s c  c w  server but i've moved well i haven't moved it i've copied it onto
the c s v  yeah
yep
nothing further is
no mm hmm mm hmm uh
and i've uh sent a thing off to marloes talk trying to encourage her again to
register for the c s v  and uh and what to the c v s  and uh wha what to do and
uh which bit of software i use that seems to be quite easy and simple
yep nope well yes and no as in yes it's new and no i haven't
got a problem yep oh so far yeah uh huh uh y
yes uh and i am just using it through um a windows bolt on
sort of piece of software
yeah no i've just yeah straight forward and then you just right right yeah r and right click things in in windows explorer that's it

mm hmm on a day like this i know it's a yeah

mm no not at the moment the only thing that's been going around is the version of the flier
i don't know what real purpose of uh these little folded up a  four fliers uh there's been bit of
uh are they just for distribution at conferences and things or do they uh
right well i i'm not really bothering but it there's that's what's circulating around the the group as a whole at the moment
um i've sorted out uh travel et cetera to munich
for e for ellen john and myself and we're all off on the fourteenth
of december coming back on the friday the sixteenth yes
that's a so that's how to hire or how to interview is that that uh book
the

spend mm hmm

mm hmm
well mm hmm
uh what el uh well i'll have to get to grips with cra camtasia uh properly
uh to generate a little sort of introductory video i suppose
uh for instructional purposes at the beginning of the experiment so people will be able to see uh and so that the p you
know example movements uh and things like that will be
in dutch as well um well
oh right oh huh right uh no that must have been before me so uh uh uh p it
i
separated
yes mm hmm yep
mm hmm yeah exa yeah so the i mean th i don't think i think it'd be more sensible just to do the
non the the video part of it first and then you add the voice over afterwards
rather than trying to do all at once you know
might use or are you going to prime them in any way doing uh anything with the voice you know if you start talking about have to avoid or uh yeah talking about the parts or just naming them or anything like that mm hmm
bef yes okay or did no n no noise in fact i think is probably uh
yes uh pro probably actually not even the sound effects 'cause otherwise they'll expect that in the real experiment
and that doesn't happen so if they make move a piece and it breaks and they don't hear this crash and they go
oh what's you know what's happened is that really all what happened yeah it's uh
mm hmm
yeah mm hmm
hmm
mm hmm
yes i think it can generate uh things
uh huh
yes mm mm hmm yeah yes but uh or in our discussion we haven't mentioned uh it was assumed
there'd be a voice over but i'll i'll i better i'll i'll remind her yeah i'll i'll i'll do
that mm hmm yes 'cause we've got to think of the instructions and sort of basic
introduction to it all as well so
actually i i did email nijmegen to ask if they'd had a set of instructions they'd given
their participants but it probably i s i suspect so because i haven't had a reply back
yeah too too uh it was just in case they had something that what
mm hmm
no that should be a problem i'll be straight forward enough i think
alright you want take it back um oh uh t uh no um th it's not got it's uh yeah it's i well b actually i could probably just photo copy the manual and there's only a
um yeah
right yeah right uh oh i've hopefully well i won't
hopefully need it for more than another week or two anyway so as long as you can hold off his no no right
um i i was looking at the the complexity sort of uh aspect of the tamgrams
in that uh booklet it's not quite that they just get harder it's that they kind of have pages
of similar um types yeah so one
page will have sort of parts that are kind of similar to each other and then you move over and there's a different almost type
of design or style uh so it's not quite as progressive in complexity as
uh
no
google
mm hmm uh i'll try i'll try you never know what's what's out there
well uh um i'm hoping the dutch input will allow us to p sort of have a rough idea of what was the of a suitable complexity for the task
uh no not even that they've of this relevant type to what we're wanting to use probably three uh we've to generate sixteen in total
mm hmm
yeah ideally
mm no well i don't i'm not
uh i'll tr i'll try the good old google and see if there is uh if there are some sort of ranking sites or whatever uh
i'll try and find out i don't know off off hand certainly
uh i'll i'll do a search b um i've not encountered them
mm well or maybe they just don't use mm anything like that i suppose for
but i'm not sure if anything's happened since then

mm hmm
as little as it is but yeah yeah yes have to
to try and yes and home home in parameters and choose the right sort of settings so yep
i'm sure she'll have views on it
mm hmm
mm hmm um oh i found haven't fount it physically yet but uh a reference to uh
a ninety two paper it's in the royal proceedings of something or other somewhere
based on a um an experiment that had blocks a model
blocks of parts and then an area where people had to build you know replicate the model out with the parts
uh just one person at a time of course but uh it did involve um eye movements and monitoring where
they're looking compared to their hand movements and uh that subject ballard
back in ninety two yes i think so uh the i'll mm not sure
yep
yeah so there should still be well not that on is it y
uh huh uh that's what i've m i'll have to try and find out uh
hmm if not um the national library is bound to have it
she's not here next week anyway it's next wednesday or thursday before she's back
oh is that what yeah she's got a mm yahoo account or something that things are getting forwarded to and
ah
or or oh well that's only if things haven't been getting through ah

um anything else
well certainly the the there's the provisional list of what we need on the wiki anyway that i put it up so
mm hmm
um well i i added things to it well better uh well i don't know when he last looked at it but uh or when i added it it was sometime in the last two weeks anyway but uh
mm hmm
that's what they're getting yeah
mm hmm
yeah
mm hmm
yeah it
it's the it's the dynamic regions that uh i think might cause a bit of trouble but uh
that filter mm yeah filter out
unless y
yep i think so
to do
hmm watch out well i think according to the latest documentation uh
you're down for five percent of your fifteen months on this project or something
some b uh jast report officially
into reality uh huh
right
mm hmm

yeah but
so yeah we put this stuff on so that so that we have some record of the whole thing what
uh are going to say and uh the whole idea
here is says also put the lapel on
uh the whole idea of this meeting is that it's not me who will be talking all the time so so that would be a boring
that would be definitely boring meeting yeah yeah yeah so i so the p
the actually the reason why we got together is that it's ab it's about the time to a  make sure that when petr
leaves us uh i'm afraid it may happen right i mean it or did you didn't change your mind yet or your girlfriend
didn't change your mind so so that whatever he's whatever he's been
doing uh is not uh forgotten and then people can stay on his shoulders and uh i hope that he won't
get out entirely out of uh out of uh this problem but still we we need to continue on this
so i think the joel will be is is my main hope that he's uh he's going to pick up uh the key word
spotting and some of these ideas and also the reason why p uh i p uh uh petr motlicek is here
is that joel is also getting interested in uh opal models of uh tem temporal envelope
yeah and of of course pet uh petr for signals so about it but petr motlicek too eh both of you you
know so but but but you will be here and from different point of view eh petr motlicek is working mainly on speech coding
yeah and uh so so this is um yeah i guess this is it so m i i guess that really you should be talking
more than anybody else because you should be asking questions yeah yeah i know so what is it that you need
to know and uh

yeah

oh this were ho how it started basically because that was uh marios athineos yeah and dan ellis
they had a paper i believe it was not in icassp a s r u  or something right it was a
a s r u  but that was a time when they weren't using very long uh uh
uh d uh segments it was like fifty millisecond or something what they were playing with at the time yeah i know
so then i the story was that then uh marios presented that at so some meeting and we realised
oh that might be cute thing uh for uh estimating uh spectral energies because that's what we want and
we'll the the way we've uh we are doing it is kind of i think it works but it's little bit inelegant
somehow stupid so so first do the frame by based uh estimate and then you you get stick to hundred
hertz sampling ten millisecond sampling or uh something and then you just pick up the trajectory so
so marios was here for half a year maybe or even more uh and uh started work with petr who also
j just came so they were working little bit together mainly m marios was uh programming in matlab and petr was putting it into
fancy is yeah and uh but uh
and but then we were hoping uh uh uh th to pick up on that little bit more and we we did right you did a little bit of work
yeah
hmm and we never published that anywhere right huh yeah
yeah
yeah
we were also doing a serious thing that we were stepping it by ten millisecond right at the time
right yeah
right
that was a reasonable start yeah
yeah
so you may be the only one in the whole world now because uh because chi fong is gone and uh and uh barry
is gone so morgan was joking no what he informed me they are gone from icsi uh chi fong went to
t i  and uh and uh uh uh b barry is at lawrence livermore lab he basically got a job
he he graduated and he's he'll be working on things which he cannot talk about he can't even say it
on a microphone here i heard it's uh i yeah it's classified work typically it's and so so
jo morgan was h only half joking he was s somebody was asking him you were or so s or somebody was asking him something
uh or there was uh there was uh matthew and he said well probably we'll be coming to ask you because nobody
really knows anymore at icsi so please stay
uh th nobody that was barry and now it's uh cl close histo actually brno is doing a a lot of that
now they picked up the software and they play with the and nets so that might be that brno
will be at the soonest as uh a ultimate expert on on the whole thing
n n where which software no they ne quicknet was done uh uh well quicknet itself was done actually long time ago at icsi
is that so
group
okay so we h have to treat him well
well the whole idea then is that then you start playing with it right and you yeah and

maybe that might be the
on frame oh
he used to have before he lost all the data but he will have it again
yeah
knows more than than than i do s so that's good
but certainly when it comes to like uh the the opal modelling of temporal trajectories even pe petr fousek is not here you probably know a lot about it by now
no that uh uh ap approximating hilbert envelope by opal model
i a v a v l p  uh as as i say when you when you are not here that that petr motlicek knows enough about it too because same ap yeah different uh application different uh different software or something
if if you make a b broader bands because when the band is narrow the c excitation is close the carrier is close to s sinusoid basically co sinusoid
you may almost want to dis uh um i b uh uh uh yeah uh b use the white board i mean uh and uh that's why we have it here right so that
i don't think so i think no we are wired
except
pulses this is l p  this is a standard time domain l p  right
but since you are in a different domain this is he here we are in time domain right but but you are you are really in a frequency
domain so it uh the line's turning to into sines right and
you p and since this this i mean because this thi this this spectrum is al has
also line spectrum right i mean all components so if you are then if we are in a frequency th your source looks
like this and
it's uh yeah right
so you know that
and this is where
and the biggest problem currently is that the carrier is actually not cosine but uh something little bit more uh uh interesting
and if the frequency doesn't change over the wa over over the lengths of the uh
yeah
yeah
but but f f fortunately because of he uh because of properties of hearing more or less for the higher bands
you if you put in just s some garbage some noise it doesn't really m w matter all that much it w sounds
little bit worse but uh it's not a big tragedy uh where you really w if you want to g do a good voice speech
uh you'll want to get the lower bands correct and if you put in uh noise altogether
it sounds like a whispered speech uh but you understand perfect
by noise
so now we have to kill them both because i mean gave all the secrets away i mean qual computers is going to
yes
if motorola or nokia gets hold of this uh tape then we are in trouble uh hopefully it by then it will be protected and and everything right
it's it's uh it's but listen this is a science i mean it's uh confidential to the extent that
we are not uh i uh publishing it yet but we w we of of course we will
and uh and uh but uh we have to make sure that that uh if qualcomm has a interest of who's
funding the work the they have to have a chance to uh to to patent it or something but that's about all this
is not a public uh public uh presentation so this i is not even a problem
the only problem would be if but you know nobody can beat p petr uh petr motlicek anymore in i
mean if even if if nokia knows everything if you if you sell it tomorrow who did you work for th the uh uh
text no t h p  h p  they will take half a year before they would even realise what it is
and by then so it's not no problem okay so that's where that's uh that's uh
to get the uh
when you comp uh w what you com when you compress the effectively they'll want the signal which we are modelling
and uh so then you get the fitting to compress signal essentially if you were in spectral domain you would
compress the power spectrum here you compress the the th this th this i the what
ful yeah of d c t  of of the signal right and so the w
then you have uh predictor is fitting actually this compress signal but you know how much c it was compressed
so you can always expand it back so that you get the c that you get a fit to the to the original thing
except that if it is different because uh it ha th basically this opal modeling has a different
properties and uh it's
so we can tell you a little bit more about it this is an uh sort of old technique which uh it
and it was my thesis even p h d  thesis actually a small sorry yeah it was s t l p 
was called spectral transform linear prediction it was my first icassp paper ever it was uh it nineteen
eighty three boston you guys were still in kindergarten right oh this
is terrible so but no nobody nobody was using it for anything
except it was cute but that was about it
and uh and but now it seems like that is since since what we are doing here we are normal l p c 
is fitting uh peaks right but when you are modeling hilbert envelope you don't necessarily want to fit
only peaks you sometimes want to get a basically good estimate of the of the envelope
so that helps you because in this uh thi thi this spectral transform allows you to to find the right balance
between how well it fits peaks how how well it fits dips and uh and yeah
and sort of the so this is g so i think that basically i don't know what else i mean you
should be asking questions right so
yeah
sapa and then yeah this is a this they are two papers in uh one is in sapa one is in uh u  interspeech
uh in a c cheju and one was in the a s r u  it was from virgin islands
sapa was a s i i tell you what it stands for statistic and ad and something
ad and uh perceptual approaches i was on f i was on a f w s organising
committee i should know but statistic and uh and something approaches uh
pe perceptua and statistics and perceptual a approaches that
was uh
but they are the same right as uh as uh and then also is there is some more work actually can be traced down
i think there wa uh the reading les atlas's papers are very good because les atlas is doing a lot of work
on coding in this domain he doesn't use opal model but he uses d c t  and then he p
uh so the so so and it and les is excellent guy he's very good mathemat mm h very good theoretician
basically he's a he's at stanford the guy and uh really he likes to write things well so he's
very rigorous uh as opposed to s to me for instance so if you read that then it then
you know that there are no errors and
yeah uh but um so whatever you g whatever you get hands on from les atlas uh for over
past five years uh regardi this two years ago last year on one of the icassps he
had like five papers right or various aspects of this because uh he's
eager to
is that so i didn't even see it yeah or
uh huh
i don't
to fill in yeah with all kinds of parameters
he has all kinds of speech recognition results right it was the first time you start using the cluster i remember or some uh some parallel processing that was a big thing here
everybody hated him for t uh temporarily i remember
uh huh
i yeah i remember frank came to me and says is everybody was computing like marius we would be all dead
but i say frank but i want everybody to compute like marius and
well it is important you know whereas i mean this is something which we never talk about right i hear it how much work
uh does put in uh here because it's true it's true this that uh that things sped up tremendously
since i came i mean uh of course partially because they started to buy some more uh more hardware but also
be p some at least some people basically know how to uh uh write faster programs
uh this is fantastic
and used to be two days yeah

uh
so do you already know where uh what is the situation with you you go back to prague for a while and then did you get anything in f in france i got some ideas by the way i yeah yeah yeah
uh huh
oh it's that's the that's the would be a pity right you you ca you t so you don't die of hunger and so yeah yeah that's not the idea no we'll we'll uh we will we'll try something let's see what we can do um
so joel your main basically thing is as i told you to t uh when we were walking that
uh that what whatever petr did that it doesn't die but it i it carries and obviously uh v
we very much hope that you get into that and you get excited and you do s more and uh or uh
maybe even different things but uh
that it actually works it's not that it doesn't work uh
yeah then
and i and this and this is all on the record so if we uh if uh if we you can hold him to his word
j ju you rewind browse through the meeting okay
how we doing time wise yeah i think half hour it's fine right
but you will be here until almost until end of uh
yeah so breaks my heart it's just like i was just start teaching and then i n i'll need an assistant
hmm yeah maybe uh yeah uh d hopefully it's make m makes uh pay pay some extra

so we'll see
either speech uh but it's co actually compilation of uh really compilation of two classes i was giving at o g i  which is like speech processing and and uh perception and so i tried to put it together so that it makes some sense
no no i've it's uh i it i should have at least four because this is a p like uh graduates but i have one alright guaranteed i have one guaranteed that i don't know if anybody else is uh
uh uh
sorry i s i don't know i don't know if it needs to be four credit or not
i don't know how much i like people without uh n not taking it for credit because then they just sit there and having good time but it's okay no no it's okay
yeah guillermo is taking very good and so i'll i s  who already have at least two if uh
yeah we pro i probably get four
and uh it's possible that's for sure i mean that's
okay
mm hmm
mm hmm yeah the notes notebooks uh huh
but that's good you know it's uh
i didn't get into too many things actually we know the reason was that at the time we thought i was teaching
with herve and we thought i we have much more time and suddenly we ran out of
time basically because what happened was that uh it was supposed to be three hour lecture but it was only two hour lecture
and uh herve assumed that it's going to run longer or i don't know what he assumed but suddenly we sa s he said well so
so where are you i said well i'm just slowly getting into l p c  he said why but i we have only three more lectures i have to teach h m m 
and everything so i the l p c  part was like i had to do it in one hour and then everybody was
c totally confused i guess and
yeah they were also confused
yeah
it was at d b f l  yeah
but
oh we'll see
okay guys i think that um this unless somebody has uh still anything incredibly important
right it's uh ju it's a little bit up to you you have to p you have to back this uh uh ha h specially petr because just to make sure that and yeah yeah
do you think that you will be done by may is it plan
i think so yeah we made a mistake i tell you i think if i had to do it again and we made a mistake we should have register you here at e p f l  you would have had a degree by now from e p f l 
yeah that was a mistake
sorry yours you were or you were here t you were you were here how long you were here two years yeah
where are the

yeah right so is she getting uh uh another position there or what is the re reason of what a boyfriend huh
oh i see so that's good mm hmm mm hmm yeah
mm hmm mm hmm yeah i know
yeah
yeah
i know yeah
um okay
otherwise i am also much more available than i was i mean when you came it was just like cra one of the craziest
uh uh times of this year uh uh it's not it's not that i was very productive
that i was doing anything useful but it just like it's a little bit like writing thesis all the time re writing
and change the do make a little changes and uh uh and
yeah he's ver no he has many more sp many more people so to take care of yeah
well i'm typically i try to be because uh because you know i mean for s this is also my livelihood right students
so i have to make sure that that that uh they need to know something that uh
so feel free basically to stop by any time and um yeah and uh it's not that i know everything
but
if i know i uh i think i sort of know a little bit like what you guys were doi uh doing right but not uh not obvi every detail obviously yeah
what yeah you don't know why why you are doing it anymore yeah oh boy yeah oops
okay i think my mic is falling falling so i think we go huh thank you very much thanks a lot
yep

s so joel is going to talk
that's mine

well may from different point of view but
yeah
right
let me just tell us so what you know already about uh i don't know how far you are with the s features or
so you know s something like that
mm hmm
but t what christos was doing right
yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm


mm hmm




yeah

what yeah yeah


we shouldn't smile
right
yeah yeah but i'm using that for different different reason right so it's uh speech coding so
uh what is the task is usual just take the speech of course somehow to encode it into
as as small number of beat as possible and with a reasonable quality of course and again
to e uh decode it and i'm using f d l p  for that still playing with uh more
less one second long segments so just dividing the speech into one s one second frames
doing d c t  it's just the standard wor of work and then doing some compression
and computation of yeah yeah yeah sh oh yeah but you are doing the same no
yeah b yeah yeah you take the the d c t  and you just divide it into several sub bands frequency bands
with a different uh
i d i do you mean
no no no no i don't do
yeah just one second with without overlapping but in frequency domain there is a overlap because
you can choose which filters you want more less or just trajectories of those bands so there is overlapping
i'm using those gaussian filters or classical those those trapet trapezoidal
like in uh m f c c s right and then processing each f yeah p l p s
okay tr triangulars that one then i'm doing s doing uh independent processing of each frequency
band so i'm computing that hilbert envelope which is just the envelope of some
temporal trajectory and more or less you can divide this into a hilbert envelope hilb hilbert carrier we
use something like l p  a linear prediction envelope auto regressive model
and excitation signal
yeah so those are two parts or items you need somehow to encode if you want again to get
original speech or reasonable quality and yeah there is some compression factor
which is again when you're computing that auto regressive model from f d l p 
you can compress the spectrum somehow in in such a way that you rather
um preserve those even also those dips not only peaks in the spectrum
and it sounds better for some kind of speech signals
so it's kind of logarithm when you use logarithm for m f c c s right so it's again compression factor something like th
and but then you have to uncompress it again of course to get back the speech and
there other other things which i'm doing but it's not related to speech recognition
so much or but
well
right right
well it's yeah sure sure i know i mean it's more or less the same approach right there is m uh just more right right right
yeah
with what
yeah yeah sure number of bands and
you know that's the problem for speech coding because i don't have results like in speech recognition so of course
i have to listen it and and s well so now what i'm using are fifteen
bands which seems to me fit fifteen frequency band which seems to me quite reasonable we can go down
till like twelve and still okay i would say but then you start hearing difference or also that's another problem
once you can go down with frequency bands then you will have much uh more c uh complicated data uh
let's say excitation signal or that carrier which yeah because broad
bands right
yeah maybe like that no so there is more and more s uh frequency components let's say or something like that in one broad band so
no l p c  will maybe but then you have still another part sometime something like a source and a filter so when you are doing speech coding or
yeah why
i don't know now it's quite long
well i mean it's it's the same like when you are doing l p  l p  synthesis right so you've got source signal i don't know source
uh
yeah and then there is some filter which is that one divided by a  z 
and that's and that's it and the source can be a noise signal or it can be some uh sequence of uh what is that pulses right
this is yeah so and it's more less or less the same what i'm doing so this is some envelope which is in our case related to hilbert envelope and this is a source signal which is hilbert carrier
right
right exactly yeah so this is now going to be frequency
yeah so more or less if we uh can we can plot it so what we can see is some hilbert envelope like this
and then there is that hilbert carrier or this not hilbert carrier but this is the signal which we get from
one di one frequency band so you compute d c t  right from signal yeah yeah exactly
and what we get from that is this hilbert envelope right and the second which should be that carrier should
be something like this it's just really close to cosine we m we might see if we do it
do it properly right and this is what you also have to somehow transmit or at least try to transmit
in order to get
right right
right
no i don't need l p c  no no this is a residual for me
yeah i'm just wan i just want to transmit this signal right it's and what you need is this envelope
and this one carrier and you again get the same signal this this this shape
doing i d c t  putting everything together
right but if you take a look for example for a s if you have a very g good music signal which is very uh periodic you can really see something like there is one peak and
and frequency more or less doesn't change it's uh related to uh that frequency of the broad
band or how it's called if you add those filters which are uh wider and wider this is that centre
frequency which is somehow related to this one so then you can transmit uh
just fe
it's worse and worse don't then you don't see any anything like cosine but
right right
everywhere
it sounds like l p c  when you excited by noise it's better i would say uh better quality definitely better quality it lower bit rate but that's a problem so so
 
yeah sure
objective measure well it was some those uh distances spectral distances well edinburgh saw probably so well i mean


i h
alright
yeah sure i see


right yeah yeah yeah also there are papers about it that f if you have like twelve frequency bands it's somehow optimal
compression is only to really to somehow feed that uh hilbert envelope to yeah yeah
yeah you can model it better there is no echo or something like reve reverberance
in the signal if you really go down with that compression factor to like zero point one
something that zero point one
so
right
it's it's s right and it's still yeah
yeah you just preserve something different little bit let's say in r s s 
yeah i think hynek has got ma many papers or some papers over that so oh in i think i read it
right more or less

right
exactly
yeah

well i think you can really take those papers from uh marius about f d l p  they are that's really enough on
what is sapa

mm hmm mm hmm
just something right
approaches mm hmm but there are also reports from idiap i think at least two reports from marius seem to me yeah they are more less they are same like
mm mm hmm
yeah yeah
right right yeah yeah
yeah
yeah definitely
sometimes unreadable i would say it's quite difficult but yeah
mm hmm mm mm hmm
yeah i think this year a lot uh interspeech there was one paper but it was regarded to speech recognition somehow y yeah yeah it was not something like speech coding or that d c t  transforms n nothing like that
so


right



right

mm maybe yes maybe no i don't it's hard to say now it's not so bad with that if you really write it f well and he did i think so sure
r right yeah yeah
yeah yeah
whatever that's not important
uh
 
oh yeah sure it is important for this case but still



right




yeah and definite
november november

what are you going to t talk or to teach it's just that perceptual stuff and
mm hmm
do you already know how many students you have no
oh it's graduate for graduates
well i think guillermo was thinking about and
hmm
well i would like to go there but not just for credits just maybe to hear something new

mm hmm



right

mm hmm
oh sure a any




i think so

why you are you doing this good question sometime asking
right
thank you
no i'm going to listen



yeah


yeah
yeah that's true

yeah speech coding
no
yeah
yeah well that's uh yeah
so
uh well uh so basically i started reading about the features that's taking the long temporal and uh time frame that's uh traps and uh tandem approach
yeah s yeah yeah so then i also started with the there was a paper on uh fitting a ear model to the d c t  of a signal started with that and slowly getting used to the stuff
s
yeah
uh i think yeah yeah it's uh the paper by dan ellis and co yeah
yeah
yeah
a s r u  two thousand four i guess yeah two thousand three yeah
yeah
okay yeah yeah
so for
yeah
mm hmm yeah

mm hmm

okay
mm hmm
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah so then i continued with uh another uh paper that you are mentioning l p  trap so i just moving around with
that ideas and also uh the main idea today why i told maybe is like if you can list down what all things are there to be
taken care of then one by one because finally face find i do have something else
so uh maybe to list down the things other than the what i've already taken from you and also to discuss generally
yeah yeah feature extraction part tandem training


'kay
so yeah right now i have the feature extraction part where i can get the phoneme posteriors and through the neural
net so then i think i need yeah yeah i yeah
but uh yeah it's t k  through for some other task i've run it's t k  so i have the general feel but
uh maybe i can take the interceptor from you and run it once on my to have it
yeah so
yeah basically so then i can can share what i ca have read and uh
yeah yes
so i'll use this yeah the
let's do the feature extraction that we have already taken then the back end for that then yeah
yeah okay uh so yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah traps i know but though with various
okay length ah
okay
frame
okay
filtering yeah
mm hmm
okay
yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
okay
okay
okay
okay
okay
uh huh
mm hmm
okay
okay
it's alright

yeah yeah that's ri
yeah
so compression basically you are looking at i guess yeah
mm hmm coding
yeah
okay
uh huh
uh huh
okay uh huh
okay
mm hmm
no that's for compression
i don't need for for compression you basically don't need the
yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm and p l p 
triangle uh yeah
mm hmm
okay
the speech signal yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
okay
mm hmm mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
okay
mm hmm
yeah yeah yeah

yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah
yeah because
yeah use maybe you can use the board for that yeah
can we remove this when you are going to this place
oh
periodic pulse yeah
but this is uh
yeah
this is like a residual for him yeah in the for uh frequency it is

for any object you measure you use for uh a reconstructed signal and uh
uh huh


yeah
h p 

so what is the compression factor we are getting here
uh huh
okay
yes
mm hmm
to fit the the
yeah
mm hmm
yeah
mm
coming back though
yes
yes
envelope yeah
yeah uh one thing i wanted to know is any um a good literature on these lines uh where you started with yeah
yeah that's one yeah o uh th oh i have two with the
interspeech paper i
pattern
okay okay
uh huh
okay
yeah
okay
uh huh
uh huh
mm hmm
okay
okay
mm hmm
okay
mm hmm
mm hmm
okay
uh huh
uh huh

uh huh

yeah so
yeah
yeah

mm hmm
mm hmm
yes
yeah
yeah


yeah so
yes uh yeah well regarding this f d l p  yeah
he doesn't send yeah yes

yes so
yeah
november
okay
yes
yeah bu three i mean four credits or uh a total of four ah
yeah
because s s in i s  it's four uh credits and uh guillermo is taking i think he's g yeah
notebooks

mm hmm
where was this in okay
yeah but i can come to yeah later
okay
uh huh
yeah
so in case i need something on this f d l p  i'll come to you uh yeah
okay
okay

takes your uh
uh huh
yeah
yeah
mm hmm

yes yeah thanks

oh what what is the topic here
well i guess so i couldn't i would like to change but i cannot

well i think that i'm more now much more than me because
oh okay
yeah
to the d c d 
oh i cannot say it to the hilbert envelope you mean no
yeah yeah
yeah okay
yeah yeah yeah
why that
i don't think so
yeah i just re wrote in in c  plus plus i didn't do us so much on that
well we we tried uh many knobs to tune on th on that because you can decide what compression factor and
everything so i tried a little bit like um pick maybe three knobs and try to go through
the three d  three d  cage to see what happens in which which kind of settings so
this we did but we we didn't because there was still
a question that i don't remember right now because there was some essential question
i i don't remember i would have to look at it f and because be before i wou before
i we could u we could write anything i i would be have to be sure that something is right there
i couldn't be sure about it at the time so and anyway it it takes time this this computation
it's it's very inefficient it takes like hundred times more than computing some m f c c s computing these features because
it's uh huge d c t  huge f f t  everywhere and
yeah there is no optimisation we just stick to the trap we wanted to make as close to trap as is possible which is silly but that w you have to start somewhere yeah
y okay
so so what well last time we we were s talking about what about gaussians you you have the gaussians running somehow like feature extraction and then the tandem training c also so the you are able to train the net now

no no so they are going from icsi
huh
yeah
eh
but who who is the one who who is now developing the quicknet and these things the the m l p  four and these things because it's
it was barry
ah i see
i see
well still we have the experts who who made the software on here you know olivier bornet and
uh quicknet training yeah yes but olivier
make it run on on these machines and make the uh cross the two g  barrier here at idiap
because we couldn't we couldn't do something i don't know what but he is he is no good in quicknet right i s
i guess yeah
um okay so so
right so you just miss the back end which is easy because it's h t k  it's everyone knows here
okay
yeah okay a and you you just need from us to hear w what are the other p front ends and other features to to choose or something
okay so how do we do it shou shou should i list it or
yeah well uh like i i d i distinguish between feature extraction
and then the m l p  because see you feed something to the m l p  which are not the waves so so well and that's that's what i
call it and then the back end but okay well so what what i have here
what i've been working on since i was here was m f c c  p l p  which is
always needed for compressing purposes then traps with w
various lengths and also uh you know traps now

with var various lengths we were trying to to start them from from
on the ultimate length of one one uh frame up to one second or even more but
it was mm so this also w then we apply
the d c t  on the trap itself which is some something like the gaussians
applying some filt filtering basically the trap so this but this is mainly franta
who was doing this
so this is related to traps i was also trying the warping means if you have a second um
which is uh a hundred and one samples i was just keeping the central ten ten samples and then i was throwing
away some some of them you know like with sampling this this uh one second of the
trap to something which i which i uh preserved all the points in the centre and just uh
picked every tenth point at the boundaries which means the trap uh hundred and one trap trajectory
shrank to say fifteen points with uh with still preserving the maximum resolution at the centre
and throwing away most of the points near the boundary so this i was trying so these i have some
results on so these are traps then the gauss traps then
tandem system
uh the tandem you plus minus half because that's that's just a p l p s and then
there is a training uh with m l p  that's taking some context of these p l p  coefficients
so it's like feeding the p l  uh p l p s or m f c s w whatever to m l p  and taking
some context this is the tandem so this set up we also have here i didn't experiment with this but
maybe you some more results oh it's hemant who has the results on tandem i guess no
yeah yeah right yeah but uh i think the
uh i think the most important results are already in the thesis he's writing so so is there some somewhere
so this is tandem uh then uh then what and then there is the f d l p 
then we can talk more about
which is which i have more experiments on also this warping and compressions and all these things so
well it's bil still sub bands no
well yeah but that you just didn't talk about any sub band so far
and by the way you don't do the overlap on the sub bands no or you do yeah but you don't do the overlap on the time domain you said somethi yeah okay so that's the difference
hmm
p l p s
m f c c  or triangles
okay
so you know about this compression how how does it why it's okay i just don't know
ah he's new he's he's doing you most of the things
so
okay
well what
i what i i d yeah well the beginning of the
oh yeah sure sure sure sure okay
yeah okay
so um just they in th um in the speech uh re synthesis or coding what you're doing
um did you try to to play with the knobs somewhere like uh many uh uh v widths i
m no no the compression number of bands and lengths of the so
what you what you were playing with and what other result like what to use so that it sounds
the best
yeah o of course you you listen to it yourself i d i'm fine with that because
yeah
okay
but
if you go down
i see
so so you won't say that the l p c  is not able to fit it so that the residual was easy

will be hero
i don't think so no no no no are not supposed
i think you have to push it push it as much as possible because it reacts to the
yeah
yeah
oh which lines
yeah okay okay okay okay okay mm hmm
i see what you mean
this is the sub band time signal it's
yeah
i see
okay so

mm hmm
i see i was thinking the residual in l p c  fit of the hilbert envelope not this i was not thinking of this at all
before you know 'cause there are three things first you have to encode this then the l p c 
coefficients and the residual after l p c  fit if you like
oh you don't
this is the residual
yeah well i
okay yeah yeah
yeah right

mm hmm
yeah that that's nice
okay and so so so the so the broader bands do what on this picture l left left
hmm
yeah that that's
yeah
although herve just said that we shouldn't s talk about confidential things here that's that's the problem yeah
okay
yeah
oh okay so so there is a compromise between the the lower bands the the worse stuff you just said and and the more bands the more coefficients to transmit so fifteen is about okay
okay so this and then there is a compression what about that
so that you get so that you can't model it actually
yeah
of what oh oh oh compression 'kay
the sub band signal

sub bands power spectrum
l p c  l  uh l p 
yeah

s
well yeah yeah yeah go on
uh
yeah they are about three papers there was uh the s s s sapa or how it's called the confere then then
and one is in in the america uh yes yeah
i i don't know i just n
you were
you don't know evaluation that's that's bad
'kay
yeah



also i can um before marius left he he has he had actually left
himself but all the files are here you know so all the m matlab implementations of these
are here and there is also one big table that he used he used to yeah
he was also playing with all these compression factors and lengths of the of of that and there
is a big table in in excel which you can look at
yeah yeah yeah this wa
uh yeah because it it it took a huge amount of time and he basically
he he was the first one to realise that these these guys are pretty slow to to do these things so he
he he just uh he just uh put here the p  make environment
and he didn't stick to any cluster or anything he just put p  make and run it on uh on all the
machines here so at some point he was using all the available memory by any mistake you know so
at th in the morning all the machines were were just stuck d no one could ever m move the
mouse

so these these resul yeah because he was doing everything in matlab so it was again ten times more demanding than c  plus plus and then
mm
but he did he wrote it well but anyway anyway because i w i in the code that i wrote
i was like playing also with if if the mat matrix is parse i really don't use it all
i just multiply from here to here from here to here not to matrix p my matrix and then i i just optimised
it a bit and also blast libraries and all these sta things but okay oh
well whatever but the t
uh
yeah
yeah but there is a the back end recognizer which i will give you which is turn around of eighteen minutes or well from eleven to fifteen minutes normally it would take hour and a half
yeah no no today it was over one hour it's just like ten times less maybe or five to ten times less but still still you can you can five times more compute
great i have to talk to you about these i i don't know i i didn't try to i didn't even mail
to to chernotsky i must say uh i just talked to one girl there
which told me that he would be possibly able to find me a job there any any job like related
maybe to field but job not not anything any research so if if nothing then then i could
be able to get the job somewhere
yeah probably yeah but t s but yeah
'kay
we hope that you find out that everything was wrong and that the potential is much bigger yeah it actually work that too
no but after you find out the back then it will be that will be the
yeah so we will send you the papers related and i will point you to all
the code which i have and yes yeah yeah
yeah
yeah i can play it back so i can just now tell the the locations of all the files and you can rewind yeah yeah ferret
um so
any any more things
yeah until twenty four it's the friday so november yeah
mm
mm hmm
it was yeah the last time it was for me it was good the course from my
from one special reason because in the f when there th were the flats in i lost all
my papers from my school all the all the exercise books um how to say this
note note yeah all the notepads and everything all the notes from any courses so i was
remembering what i was learned or what i was taught at the time so so i have it now back
at least partially 'cause all the all the algorithms you were speaking about
yeah uh uh i would add
yeah
now
mm hmm
mm
oh some
yeah
yeah
yeah and also in the in the l lab labs the d people didn't know anything about it and they just follow the papers it was
yeah
uh
not to this topic
yeah but anyway after i'm back i'll be still on skype and all these things so no problem to contact me until i don't know may next year so it's fine
well i would like to yeah i should
but i would have to study here for that that long time no i th
two two years yeah and i would have to stay one more uh well it would be good reason for petra that i have to stay here
yeah yeah because she has a good position because she has a friend which is starting
who is starting a lab there and everything is it's a great opportunity for her at least but
the problem is and then she will go back and there's uh f family issues and all these things you know
for a girl it's always the pain because she has to break for some time at least a little but has to break and
in in the science it's not that easy to to break
okay

yeah
yeah but
yeah but i think definitely you are the best person here to with uh related to availability
of you because if if if i want to go to herve i probably call secretary he's
there or and when i can and i there was no op uh no
ev every time i came to you you were available at least it
that's great

you know the core which we don't remember anymore programming we know the details and you know what what is th what is the global stuff
uh ask hynek ask my boss
yeah
yeah
oh
thanks
yeah
yeah


um a little bit but uh i'm m i'm not sure he knows uh everything
so uh basically uh well first we tried to
um explain why in this uh resc uh n  best list re scoring uh
from the slides to enhance the speech recognition on the meetings data is not working
so um uh that's one thing and uh so
what we did with alessandro is uh um ch t uh performing some statistical
tests to see whatever r if the if the words uh the the
appearance of the words during the meeting is uh in independent of the ap
appearances of the different slides
so the in the case if it is dependent that would mean that certain words tend to appear during
certain slides and that there is a correlation and uh then there will be uh a
reason like for believing that uh this will work
the resu the result was no
yeah true yeah almost nothing
mm hmm
mm hmm
huh so matthew we were uh yeah it's uh we were talking
that we did some experiments to see if the word during meeting the words appear independently of the
slides in a sense that uh if certain words tend to appear during certain slides or no
and uh the answer is uh no and uh so we did a statistical test for that
and i will add also that we did that on the uh w the words after filtering
them from the removing the the stop words yeah so uh so uh bec s
because yeah with the stop words okay th there would be a reason for uh
in independence because there is uh such a huge mess of them but uh even uh after removing
them uh there it it remains uh independent
and actually uh so when i was doing the re scoring experiments i was doing that on uh one meeting that i
selected as being like the best looking one uh it ha it had the
m the most uh slides and now i did the same uh on uh the other
meetings which were available where well it's only three meetings because well
here there are four of them which are from the test set uh from the ami recogniser w but only three of
them have uh slides so it's total of three meetings and for the others the tendency and
i c 'cause you know i was when i was doing re scoring i was uh taking into account the
for one given slide also the n neighbouring slides and as i was in increasing the number of slides
which were affecting the the utterance i was re scoring um the performance was improving
sli s uh slightly very very little but uh
yeah
uh the the first thing we are talking about ex the experiment to see the uh if it's dependent or independent
how we did it uh so we used the pearson uh chi square uh test no
ah okay it was to to see if uh certain words
have a tendency to appear during uh uh they if they
are more likely to appear during certain slides w
hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm yeah
yeah
yeah and the answer to that was no and s so
when extending the those experiments to the other meetings uh when while i was
observing an improvement on the first meeting i was using uh so i was r observing an improvement
as i was increasing um like the um the context
yeah uh
on the on the recognition yeah so there was uh the improvement was also increasing as i was increasing the context
while on the other meetings it's um it's it's it's
really fluctuating and uh i it it uh it looks more like
um uh ps uh well what's the word for that
statistical um um fluctuation
so uh
mm hmm
huh
mm hmm
exactly
so that's why um uh if we look on the
relationship that uh exists between the speech and the slides uh the task of
improving the recognition uh the overall um sp
uh speech recognition using the slides uh seems to be uh uh not
very uh um good i mean um we cannot expect much from from it
mm well for now the uh most effort was
uh on uh um showing why i it's i it's it will not work
especially those experiments and these uh statistical tests but uh
we w were thinking for example of a task like um trying to
uh see if uh where a speaker is talking i mean if the
speech is actually correlated with the slides uh where the slides uh which
happen during the not correlated but if the
uh well if the um
if the speaker is actually talking about what is in the slides or not
indicator

yeah or for example uh what happened for example in one of the meetings is that p people were um summarizing
the the results of the previous meeting you know so in the beginning so the meeting started with
the summary of what happened uh previous time and this was not related to what was
on the slides
link uh
but this is one yeah
huh
mm hmm
yeah it was recycling uh kind of

task

huh
huh
even summarization or
mm hmm mm yeah
uh no no but for the other thing you know uh uh the alternative measures or maybe we should finish with this first uh i mean uh

yeah this uh this would be a f uh another subject i would like to discuss s but uh w but uh uh basically ju just you know if we finish uh discussing this first
mm hmm
this is not clearly defined yet
but uh um something um using this relationship uh between the slides uh and other even other tek textual support and the uh and the speech
huh
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm yeah sure
well this is um the
question i'm working on
mm hmm
mm hmm mm yeah
yeah that that could be interesting to try to merge those two uh things uh yeah yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm yeah
yeah and i um uh

are they are interested in that or no
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm yep yeah that's what what is missing
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
uh huh
mm hmm
no
ami meeting
mm hmm
mm yeah
it's a first step
hmm
hmm
and we could uh do automatical uh speaker rating if there are good speakers or bad speakers depending if they just read uh
mm hmm
yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm mm hmm yeah
yeah
mm hmm
maybe possible someday yeah

mm hmm


well uh did trying to really determine the um the um uh subject of something for my proposal i mean
yeah aro around february or march so really um
yeah so to find something for that uh also with the th thinking maybe turning this uh work into publication the one about the for sure
and uh also uh uh well that uh depends a little
on on on you but try to finish with the um measures and the call routing
'cause i was talking with that uh about that to herve uh since i was uh i will recycle this poster for
i m  two you know about uh about this and uh that could be cool to to finish it maybe fuse it
with uh ian's work and uh do a journal paper he was suggesting
so so you're so what you are saying is that you you noticed that when you um tried other features and uh
because and initially it was a s nuance trained on nuance uh no or
mm hmm

run run run what exactly
for the the the call routing itself or the recognition uh the phoneme recognition
yeah i have all uh jean yves's uh scripts and uh programs for performing the call uh routing i think uh starting from the phoneme sequences
yeah i i know that i don't know how to use the cluster
yeah if it's just running a script i don't know if it's
but this is basically detecting speech and no non speech
yeah it's this uh problem i hear every time on the speech meeting how do we detect speech and not speech ah and uh
or oh okay
it's not just speech and silence it's speech and and okay
mm hmm
mm hmm
but who really can do uh when somebody will really be able to do that i mean detect the speech from non speech it will be a little revolution no in the
mm hmm



yeah well this is basically in my three uh main jobs uh proposal uh um this
ah yeah yeah yeah but yeah ah yeah sure but uh uh
uh shouldn't make it clearer before on the on the
on what uh i i will write and even uh a first uh uh submission
using this work um will make things clearer for me uh writing them down and f for
it will help i think for that also
mm
mm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah well i think uh first uh this submitted and this will help for the proposal and since uh we cannot start immediately with the measures i think that's the best thing to do
mm well no well for me it's i think we uh it's fine
yeah and i think uh that will be exactly one hour and uh uh fill the tape uh the tape is sixty minutes ah so i was right
ah yeah
uh huh
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah yeah
okay we start waiting for people coming late and uh i can say this because in this moment you cannot answer because you don't have the microphone so i can say whatever and you cannot reply so yeah
ye
in my opinion it is no because of the nature of the language i mean intuitively of course you tend to use more the words that
are on the slide  but the mass of the words actually you use are words that are
common just think that fifty percent of the words on average whatever corpus you take are stop words
articles et cetera so in terms of recognition fifty percent goes away of the rest uh remaining fifty percent
i mean are all words that appear one two three times so in any case even if actually and they tend to be
uh related or a statistically related to a single slide in any case in terms
of uh recognition do not help at all or help a very little so uh that's the kind of
thing uh i mean that's the kind of measure the ind statistical independence is not on single words is overall which
basically means in terms of recognition that doesn't help
hmm
you know even if actually i remember i just made some measure uh saying okay l let's look at how many words i don't have in the dictionary and are in the slides it was two percent
exactly
exactly
exactly so some in some sense it intuitively it sounds very good but in practical terms in terms of
recognition uh here we we we have to be clear if you want to improve the recognition that im improves
very slightly uh it is different if you want to have other tasks where the only words
that all are words in that case even the slight improvements uh he gets
at that point they can make the difference but does the recognition
and some way the statistical independence i think it can be a good explanation to show why it is happen even if it is counterintuitive but that's that's what happens basically
yeah
mm hmm
be be b be careful it's not exactly this because for sure there are words that tend to be so the point
is you want to verify whether you can improve the recognition rate by using as an information the words
that uh are contain in the slides so basically the idea is that uh in the moment you are in the slide somewhere your
language change accordingly to the slide so the fact of having that information somewhere can help you to improve
the recognition but actually it's not what happens and this does not happen for many reason first
for example fifty percent of the words in any kind of text are stop words so are everywhere
and the remaining a appear so little that in the case cannot really improve that much most of the words we use
actually whatever we talk about are common uh words so how to verify this
i mean this is something that has been measured et cetera but still is a bit qualitative to have a quantitative measure
mm hmm we simply did uh a measure of statistical independence between the words
in general so not some words the words in general otherwise you can see that if a words appear once
basically it is one hundred percent related to one slide huh but you have to i if you want to consider in terms
of recognition performance you have to make it overall i mean what is important is not the word that appear once it's
the word that appear

if uh i exactly if if there is one word that appear once all over the meeting it appears in correspondence
of one slide then of course it seems to be very related but very few words uh they represent
a very little part of the word mass mm so we simply used a very old test
statistical test that basically measure the hypothesis that some way the probability of having one word
in correspondence of a certain slide is simply the product of the probability of the word
for the probability of the that's it so that's what we did but is in general the language and not
certain words because certain words for sure have a strong dependency on the slides
but there are l few yeah
fluctuations
mm hmm
it is not in terms i mean for me for example it was not in the sense that uh after working a little bit on language
you realise that this kind of thing do not help simply because most of the words uh have nothing to do specifically
with the subject you use uh most of the words we use uh that's strange but are simply necessary to build a sentence
there are very few uh content uh words but it is true that intuitively
uh as we are driven in our attention uh i mean in in our understanding we're pretty much driven by attention
that we tend to spot only those words
exactly and in some sense intuitively it seems that it can happen i mean this is not the first attempt to do
things like this and it never works actually i in terms of recognition for other task
it can be uh it can be uh helpful
yeah
yep
be careful correlate is a dangerous word in statistic it seems to be the opposite as before
the
or roughly basically uh one thing it can't be done and and here uh on the contrary for example
the few words that are mm how may i say it recognized more can really make the difference
it isn't the case if you want to see if uh i mean what if seen in the meeting and that okay there are presentation then
yeah still the slide is there but actually the people talk about other things or not really
other things but the slide is no longer uh a support for the discussion huh there are moment that actually
this is the support because the people describe et cetera and there are moment where it is not is a just a background uh
thing and we rough estimated very quickly but it was one third of the time at least in in the meeting
we have seen
the slide were just there i mean but they were no longer use as a support it was a discussion rather between people
so in that case the presence or the absence and especially the frequence with which you observe
the words that are on the slides can be an excellent uh uh clue huh
indication a clear indication whether actually does it support of the discussion or not uh
it can be this it can be interpreted as a kind of focus of interest it can be simply interpreted in the sense of saying uh okay
i mean you have this channel open there do i have to p taken into account or not
or also in terms of action yeah uh when you see that s the discussion is completely m disconnected with
respect to this some way uh it means that it's happen in something different than before
so i mean it's a kind of feature that in my opinion can be easy to detect it and um that can
yeah uh f can be interesting to do relatively easy to do and uh in that
case for example the few words mm that you that you get more can make the difference
oh so is that mm double way to to show how some way dependent on the task
what do you mean exactly
mm hmm
yeah some way well there are f yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah


yeah
mm hmm hmm yeah i know this we are s s talking about today short term
if you want uh things just to the use the things i mean all the work they that has done basically which is a huge work
and the data we have then uh enough for the for a thesis of course it must be much better but
of course the there's only two two different kinds of words some of them you can do it on a single meeting
so this kind of feature extraction because basically that's what it is saying yes no this channel is good now is
background now is foreground et cetera you can put it in that in that way this you do it on a single meeting and then
there are corpus um based um how may i say it works
so yeah that is one possibility for example finding the connection between different meetings
then i don't know i mean at that point it becomes pretty much crucial the kind of uh data you have
in the sense that for the way we have collected the data some way i don't know if it can be at the same time too
easy in the sense that some way you have little groups of meetings extremely correlated
so i mean it it makes it easier i mean i don't know how much significant can be at that
level it can be
i in a sense if you want uh this kind of words become interesting when the corpus is really
big uh uh when when you when you consider each meeting as a single item so it's interesting when you have
tens hundreds thousands of meetings which is not the case but i mean you can do other work if you consider
in terms of speaker turns or in terms of slides and that is immediately multiply
yeah yep yep that is another
so it can be one more feature that helps in but it is very short term i mean just uh well it is ju just few few few times we talk together and it was just mean the very quick thing you can can have uh like this
mm hmm
but i think in a sense in my opinion well there are two things when this uh statistical test it can be we have made an experiment we get a result somewhat counter intuitive we give an explanation
and uh that's it i mean that's that's something that some way closes here so when it gives you
the kind of answer you get is that okay to go in that in that direction maybe is not the best thing maybe to improve the recognition
that way is not uh something you can expect so it gives the possibility to decide to go uh
in a different direction that can be more on this uh let's say
this is
hmm
mm hmm hmm

well uh i think the advantage eventually w i mean the advantage with this kind of things is that are much easier gaze tracking is still

just with the environment is a difficult thing i mean it requires cameras with pretty good quality et cetera
uh but i think his question is more uh general a and it says so i mean based on this work do
you figure out uh a direction if they guess correctly uh a domain
a direction for your thesis for your exactly exactly exactly
exactly exactly
one domain yeah not a collection of little uh things completely unrelated but uh
that's very

mm hmm
yeah
m but still doesn't solve the problem of saying what i yeah yeah sure sure what i what you are going to do for your thesis i mean as herve said i mean basically if you have to explain in four lines
what will be the topic of my thesis the subject of my thesis
and it is something that is not just saying i'm going to do uh this this this and that i mean because this we actually don't know but yeah in a very broad sense i mean w what you're going to investigate what kind of uh
if i interpret correctly

then uh one basic thing i suggested even thinking about i mean is exactly this stru
all these scenarios that can be a meeting that can be presentation where you have a s a relationship
between speech between things that are said and uh some textual documents some way
why not try to to to to study this relationship to improve this relationship to use this relationship for
um mm whatever it is indexing or annotation or whatever meta data extraction and
if you want for example this little work uh about seeing when the slide channel is background and foreground
is not beginning of this kind of thing so a relationship between two channel that provide some kind of information
mm hmm sure sure sure sure sure sure
mm hmm
no no be careful for the recognition in general there is no correlation in
the sense that even if you're talking about what is on the slide most of the words you use most
of the words you use are not really correlated to that are simply words and consider also that we all speak english
here and apart of uh native english speakers we have a very limited vocabulary in general so we tend
to use always the same words but on average you know linguistic research shows that on average the people use five hundred words
that's what we have a disposition and we say everything uh yeah we say everything with that and probably
we not a native english speaker we use even less
so that's gives an idea of why basically in terms of recognition it doesn't really help because
you always use anyway the same words and a few occurrences of words that are there in terms of recognition
make one two percent so maybe it's not enough to justify uh an effort
to improve the recognition then you can change of task and use a task the task we were mentioning about the back channel
or foreground channel in that case the only words that really are important are
those words that appear on both slides at that point i mean a little improvement
of that it becomes a big improvement i mean maybe in terms of recognition it's zero point five percent
but in terms of that task is maybe twenty percent
yeah
yeah
that's another interesting point i mean we are using data that are fake any uh in any case they are simulation no real data and especially the slides i think i've seen those slides i mean they are pretty much artificial

exactly but but not pre prepare but
yeah but
yeah i yeah i mean uh everything is pretty much artificial that that's what i mean so you mention for example this uh
fact that sometimes uh speakers tend to read this is especially true when you have bullet list huh sometimes people
really go through it didn't happen in the data simply because uh uh it was not the same people
prepa uh exactly ah so for example it will be possible in any case because the herve's infrastructure
is ready and now we are going to collect the presentation there maybe we can see
the audio is is is very bad i i thing is really
you know that was collected m a little bit like this without uh too much care it
was it was uh a personal effort of mael that decided to do it it was really good to do it it was very good
but basically it was made without any specific um you know without thinking we want to recognize
just to have them so the especially the audio channel is absolutely awful
mm hmm
yeah
uh that's uh that's that is one of the reason for example why which uh mark we point pretty much on slides as
a mean of indexing because at that point there is no interaction between humans and capture
because whenever you have microphones that you have to move it's it's it becomes complete uh really
yeah
we are building this slowly i mean it's it's unfortunate i mean is is is taking time for the material and so on but yeah there will be this

uh it will be one camera pointing very general but just for display purposes essentially
one uh microphone and we are thinking to use uh lapel microphone you know this this thing
and so that potentially helpful hopefully helpful to to do recognition and to slides
through the projector
wo
let's say that uh in any case uh w well there are two reason first of all we are trying to do something that
can be easily the the the idea is really it's something that you take you bring somewhere else and it works
so it must be as easy as possible but in any case i mean the device we are doing has
input channels so some way you can add as many input as we want so we are dealing now with
three but there are other input uh lines open

mm hmm
mm hmm
although at that point we can use this i mean i was mention the the lapel microphone mm just like this but
if you tell me this that's very interesting because at this point we can use this kind of things but i don't why
why not uh so there will be other data their test data uh and especially for this kind of problem
i think it can be a much more useful kind of data because there is real presentations i mean is it's
reality you know it's it's it's uh y n it it it it's exactly
it's more realistic and um yeah probably it can help go in this direction
of saying well let's see what happen between speech and slides uh
yeah yeah yeah
yeah mm hmm
yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah
mm hmm
yep
okay that is cool
yeah yeah that's cool
uh yeah yeah yeah it's a it's a european project anyway so i guess uh it must be available somewhere yeah
mm hmm
yeah
yeah
yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm m
yeah mm hmm
but only we're measuring one third it's not
at least in no i'm uh talking now about um the meeting
how presentation of course on presentation it it should be one hundred percent yeah yeah yeah yeah of course no that
is just something that in my opinion uh with the work that's been already done is something
we can get pretty quickly it's an interesting task it's more specific on uh meetings certainly
not for uh for presentation and it represent a nice task that can be measured that is clear
and
mm yeah yeah uh i in terms of actual recognition
can of course uh help so it's it's uh but of course not going to be
it's not going to be a kind of thesis about this no that doesn't make any sense i mean
that uh in a sense if you want i mean that that's at least the way i see the that list i have made for my own thesis i mean uh
you define that domain i mean which is uh large i mean which can be very general so interaction between
uh speech and slides cool and then you see how all these things this two little works or the statistical
independence and detecting when it is uh are two little
works that some way fit in that very general uh framework
shown from this point of view it n that things mm there are other things for example one that i really would like to do which is kind of fun
so when you have a bullet list can i click on one of the bullet and get
the piece of speech where the guy was talking about that because sometimes people just read sometimes
people uh im improve is more uh so for example that what that's another thing that fits
in that kind of uh mm framework and that's interesting in terms of
uh i mean first of all again is measurable in terms of browsing in terms of retrieval
in terms of indexing annotation meta data extraction that can be applied in many
that would be you know that uh that's uh that's something uh you're maybe joking now that's something that can uh be done for example

and uh some way there are parameters that can be measured that tell you that following certain
uh criteria uh there is one very easy for example i had the the the sp there are speaker that never look at
the audience those are bad speakers in general it's very wrong you have to look at the audience
this is one there is for example and this is something that eventually can be done if you have a certain number of
words on your slides you need a certain amount of time to read them the speakers
that take a time which is too close to that they are not good speaker because some way
uh um they're talking too fast

they are not uh
yeah they are not giving you the time and there is a certain number of things that can be uh some way detected
and measured that tell you whether the speaker is actually respecting some form of uh uh it's a
bit uh of having difficult and uh i would not um go that much in that direction
i mean it's uh but you know you know uh
figure you know
tables number ah visual things well that's for example with uh we submitted a project with j
jean marc um to use that thing as meta data and basically one thing for example we're
trying to do and and again this is something that can fit huh it will be not uh maybe but but uh
if you get the project et cetera in any case it's something that jean marc and me we want to do uh based on the kind of graphic
object you have so tables questions uh figures plots et cetera the
side one for example it is a result
try to get so that's again in terms of structuring browsing structure and retrieval okay when it is a result when it is an introduction
when it is uh
yeah
yes yes yes yes yes yes uh

um
it's not really true it's not really it's not really true yeah yeah it's not really true yeah that's o it's one of the most funny thing
i mean you can see when you work in this thing each one of us has an idea and then it's not true at all i mean s some
people actually are stick very carefully if the p if they put in the outline uh let's say
title one title two then you'll you find title one title two but many other people and i am one
of those people for example are much more general so my outline is something like introduction and
experiments the results conclusions you don't find the same title in the slides

it's it's really a different style of uh there are people that don't put for example outline we were
uh for example in the um corpus of m l m e  so the one is on the demo fifty
percent of the presentation have no outline in the
corpus of the tam two thousand four tam presentation twenty five
percent of the presentation have no outline at all
that's that's uh what yeah uh w it is and basically that's that's uh and again the outline is typical
maybe in scientific presentation well in that case that majority has other kind of presentation probably no
i mean it's it's an habit we have but um you but again uh
i mean unfortunately th n there is nothing true nothing true is is everything is chance pretty much so uh that was on
on possible work
mm hmm
not maybe for sure
yeah
mm hmm
i see
i know yeah yeah i know i know i know
i see
and so essentially say well as there is this silence time which tend to be even more than
than how it is so better to have a kind of silence detection so something that really takes this and they recognize
only that uh that part this will improve the phoneme uh recognition rate
that's what it of of course of course of course and at that point even the uh call router that uh jean jean yves has uh made can improve uh its performance
and it can be used after uh tool for the measure work uh
that we got mm hmm
mm hmm
mm
mm hmm mm hmm
mm hmm
sure sure then oh yeah yeah yeah i know i know the problem
i see i see i see
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
i see i see the problem
i'm not not sure it's yeah i'm losi
no no mm hmm
mm
no no basically because it was not at uh at a level that could be anyway so the idea
was good i think yeah with a better uh phoneme recognition rate definitely it could
uh improve also the the call routing performance
nope but we can we can find
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but we can some way find a guy i mean this should should be
have all details so it should be relatively easy to at least this is the last news i had and then
i can try to get him back uh
yeah no going very pra pragmatic uh there is a submission uh deadline for example thirty one december for conference on multi media and expo where i think these two little works on
so it can be
it's as a proposal because as far as i understand this work on the phoneme anyway still takes some development time in the sense that uh no
okay
i see
mm hmm
and
yeah
anyway the good news is that there are results you are you have just to to decide uh
yeah what what what uh what you want to work first and and and finalise i think you can really
start finalising mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah it's okay

so the tape is ta tape is at the end

yeah sorry about that matthew is still on the way

okay hang on reply coming yeah it's okay u oh i hate these things
voila okay so
um we can maybe get a head start um have you been talking to matthew about what you've been doing or

yeah
yeah yeah
yeah
yeah which was the intuitive feeling
yeah yeah and is and the r result was no but uh bu but the question is if is that result no because it's no or is it also just because there's not really enough data to be sure about anything
sure
yeah okay yeah
yeah
yeah
it's not gonna yeah
yeah yeah yeah
this is so sort of a feeling that we had but hadn't shown i think i mean i in uh from
uh from an application point of view it might be interesting to make sure that your vocabulary contains all the words on the
slides but from a research perspective it's not interesting
there'd be very few
well this is h this is how the dictionary's calculated it calculated such that if you don't have the word it doesn't affect to a great degree the the the word error rate so
yeah
sure
yep
m like yeah
yeah
yeah
but th yeah no well this is yeah that's yeah
yeah
oh sorry about that yeah
of course yeah yeah yep 'cause it's not gonna make any difference yep

yep


hmm

yeah
hmm

i mean the it's probably very dependent on the speaker as well some people have a habit of just reading what
they've got on their slides and some people are com are are well or or or quite purposefully
talk about different things so that they've sort of got multi modality of you know but so i mean
i guess that's not a surprising result then the um
yeah
yeah
s
yeah
yeah
yeah sure we s go straight to the semantics of the yep
hmm
yes maybe
okay
oh okay
well i mean uh it just comes down to the to the mere fact that word error rate is just take the words how many of
them did you get right take plus or minus two or three or five or ten words doesn't really make any difference
so yeah even if those words at the end of the day would be quite important in any sort of search
of the transcript but at the end of the day why wouldn't you just use the slides to search the transcript
i if you have th slides then yeah
no y you'd ju i mean the uh i mean it so i
mean have you been doing other things then have you have you been thinking about what you would like to
to do in in in place of this or or or leading on from this given what you've
learnt
'cause ours is strict yeah yeah
associated

yeah
sure
the focus yeah okay
yep
okay
m meeting action sort of focus
yep
hmm
yeah
yep
yeah
yeah sure
yeah
w
well
yeah
ye yeah okay so i mean uh you could begin with s saying the a um the simple task
of just determining whether or not the speech is related to the slide content and which is sort of building upon what
you know dong and others have worked on in terms of you know is it discussion monologue from the original m  four data collection
uh a y are are you also considering that you could actually look at the relationship between
meetings for instance um well okay well i mean it if if if
these similar sort of phrases or words were discussed in this meeting and
were also discussed in the previous meeting then you sort of have a a link between meetings for instance
i don't know i don't know how this you have to ches the check the statistics but i i mean 'cause obviously you've gotta think
towards what you know this this won't occupy ab ab you know won't occupy you for three years or whatever
just on this i guess but have to look at all the future and so just a s
yeah yeah
okay
yeah
yeah okay
yeah
and yep yep
yeah
well y yeah
sure
yeah
yeah i mean uh it's it's and because we don't have all the data collected or annotated yet it's it's very difficult to know isn't it
yeah yep yep yep
hmm
yeah sure or b or as you say back channel versus yeah 'cause i th think that's quite interesting i mean 'cause it's an awful lot of speech activity which is yeah
sure
okay
okay so i mean as far as that you've got everything to do that i presume um you don't need any extra stuff from us in the immediate future or i mean that's good that's good but i mean it it
uh yeah i wouldn't get too distracted i guess on d d if you've got two tracks i'd like to
yeah um
yeah
hmm
but i
and uh the k and the question is also are there other sort of more sensible ways of doing it for instance um gaze tracking i mean if if people are looking at the slides
yeah sure and it has specific to the environment and all that sort of thing yeah
yeah
yeah
mm uh but i mean for instance it should be linked to the other stuff that you've been doing on um
call routing for instance and and um you know uh error merit err error
measures yes i mean i think i mean i i think that it's possible to draw some sort of relationship
between the two as we were saying i mean maybe if you you don't measure things in terms of word error rate maybe this sort of information does
actually mean something given that fifty percent of the words are not actually interesting
um so i mean
w
well w uh w no it doesn't solve the problem but it's f what is it yeah
hmm

sure

mm
yeah
i think i think it's maybe an interesting test scenario and we know that you're
sort of basing something around speech and and text i think there needs to be one sort of extra
higher goal above that so that you can motivate future research
hmm
yeah
yeah this was
yeah for english it's especially low yeah
yeah
speci
yeah
yeah well another thing you have to remember is these models have been tuned to include ami
data so i mean perhaps if you had slides and and presentations to do with something
that was off topic you didn't have you hadn't seen any prior data then you might see a bigger contribution as well
but i mean essentially you've actually sort of included the information from the slides in the language model
yeah
okay okay they're pre pre prepared okay

yeah yeah
it's not there okay
y the audio quality though yeah yeah
was good to yeah
yeah
ah yeah they had like uh y uh y they you know they had this set up with the uh the microphones so someone
every it there was one microphone shared between every two people but they had deals with people forgetting to turn the
microphone on forgetting to turn it off uh f it was it was meant i think they they
chose that lecture theatre possibly with the idea that it would be good for collecting data i mean i uh i'm sure
they could have probably had university of edinburgh host it or whatever but i th i think
the you know the h c i  part of it didn't quite work out to how they planned so ap
yeah um it is i mean it's same as us putting on a the headphones and whatever i mean even that
minor thing i mean any any audio captured during that period is i is rubbish but
there's no sort of system that's really built to d to be able to say when you're you're capturing that
okay
the
uh what will that incorporate will it incorporate like uh an s m a  and uh
yep
okay
yeah okay
okay so no no uh microphone arrays or anything like that i guess that's quite a that's a quite a bi big deal for setting up the recordings i guess
yeah yep
as you want yep
okay
yeah but let's pretend that it's not going to happen in any foreseeable future wh uh the
i mean i'm just thinking from practical perspectives you'd you'd have to the the ami recognition system that we
have now is either for these microphones or for the microphone array there's no lapel system
trained for instance so i mean that in itself it would i mean you'd have some fun training some more speech recognition
models but
yeah
yeah yeah yeah that's
sure
yeah
it's what you should be using for this type of task
i think
yeah and every time we d we generate a new corpus and try to carry out new research we discover
sort of areas that are too controlled you know i mean the ami ones were a lot better in term
of that than m  four or whatever but still i mean es especially when you get into higher level
sort of uh interpretation it's yeah oh well i'm
uh i'm just curious do the like the icsi meetings do they have anything other than the audio do they have slides or anything along that i don't think
they would okay i'm just thinking whether or not there an are any other sources i mean maybe chil data
'cause it's i think it's gonna be more like the tam type situation so
mm hmm
i don't know but i mean given that it's coming from the same basis as ami i i expect there has to be some sort of relatively f liberal sort of distribution policy yeah
yeah the one thing about that and this is something that came up in the last nist evals was the fact that it's almost
too uni modal you've just got one lecturer talking so once again you don't see the the complex
sort of levels of interaction i mean uh y uh there's no way of getting around that i mean
you just have to think of a a task a challenge that is relevant to that type of recording which might mm you
might use the same methods as what we've been pr talking about today but the actual sort of what you're trying
to measure might need to be slightly slightly different i guess i don't yeah you know in terms of in terms of
say measuring whether or not they're talking about the slides or off channel i mean you might find ninety eight percent of your data is
directly referring to your slides in a t in a tam
that is uh is in tams
yeah but i'm i'm meaning if you move on to these corpora yeah so you might wanna be doing something else basically yeah
yeah
yep
yeah
yep
yeah and uh and at the s and at the same end of the day you're probably going to be using or learning about the same techniques that you'll need for doing other things along these lines so
okay
it well it's it's to make a proposal basically for your yep uh
this n
okay
yep
the sp
mm hmm
yeah
sure sometimes it's a lot more
yeah
yeah
mm yeah
yeah
well you'd uh sure
at l at at least spot if they forget to talk about something and it won't let them continue on to the next slide until they've gone through all the points
yeah
yeah
yeah well uh that that was just through sheer weight of content though
w
b yeah
as in five six you know number where where the graphemic yeah well i yeah
yeah
although i remember discussing this like um 'cause uh when neville was working on his his
stuff which was just based on the slides if um he he asked me all you know could i pre segment the
slides for him uh you know because you wanted to s you wanted to have the topic segmentation and i said well
just look at the the headings because anybody generally who writes the slides
yeah it's not okay it's true for me then okay

yep
okay
yeah
okay okay uh it yeah it depends yeah that's a stylistic thing as much as anything yep
yeah
hmm
mm
yeah which uh whether or not that's a good or a bad thing it depends on the talk yeah presentation yeah
yeah
yeah
something we're taught at university from a very young age the structure
yeah yeah sure it's all subjective
hmm
okay okay
okay
yeah yeah it's quite strictly imposed now

ye
yeah after the after the hard drive crash we took the time to actually rebuild the the the
system and actually train 'cause originally we sort of had the idea of oh we'll use a recognizer that's been trained on a large amount
of telephone speech data and that should give us a better result i just as a contrast i trained one specifically on
this data results were almost identical um which says to me there's something
wrong with the data rather than and it's nothing serious it's simply that it hasn't been um
chunked it or or segmented in a way that's typical of speech resources
in terms of um you can have like uh a two second utterance uh credit cards and then twenty
seconds of silence coming after it which in which when you f when you first think about it you just think oh
silence whatever nothing will happen but a lot of the normalization that we use
uh yeah c m s  c  c v n  uh so w we need a decent end point detection system
running before we can we can we can do that and we're converging on having one
now just in in sort of tandem with this development of this web based recognizer um
but of course unfortunately all these things take time um but i i think we should see
a decent sort of improvement then not just in terms of no longer having recognition errors whenever silence
appears 'cause you get that immediate benefit that you don't have any insertion errors but also it should actually affect
the recognition on the speech segments as well
th
the
yeah
yeah
mm that's the hard p oh i might uh given the trouble we've had with this corpus i can't make any promises
that's the intention yep
sure sure
we trained the system just on this data like there were there were six thousand utterances that weren't
used for uh the call routing side of things i think they th there were thirteen thousand in the entire corpus six
t half of them roughly we've thrown away so use that for acoustic training and the results from that were almost the same
as what we got for the c t s  model
y yeah but one can imagine a commercial system uh that that that s steven cox used from nuance probably had all these things built in end point detection et cetera et cetera so
mm
yeah
yeah and there's also just things like tele uh receiver noise at the beginning and or at the end of the and i mean these these are things you can get rid of if it's a
mm
yep
mm okay this is f okay okay we can just run some generic yeah
well i don't mind running it i've got all the scripts set up so
well i'm not i'm not sure i see the point actually uh
mm
i don't know yeah whatever i don't know thing th i don't know whether that a
i don't know whether that's a
we might as well 'cause i mean we've up until now uh you haven't been running any recognition on and neither did jean yves on that on that data
yeah
yeah
oh sure but i mean the scripts are so automated it's just a matter of sitting uh uh submitting a job to the cluster and
i don't i don't see the point of that i don't mind running it that'd it'd be like uh half an hour's work in a day
to run the recognition scripts i mean i i i i know you're saying artem should familiarise
himself with the a s r  systems or whatever fine but i don't uh i d i don't think this is a point
that's worth sort of worrying about at this stage anyway i mean
well 'cause i'm i'm sort of assuming that that we're gonna have so an end point detection regardless of this working on this nuance corpus so
we need it for ami we need it for um the online demo for uh all these things yeah
it's it's a lot more difficult than you would think
well it's speech and any and any other class of sound that's the problem it's
and is
and any other class yeah if it was just silence it'd be easy but uh um and in controlled
places you can't just assume it's it's you know any energy below a certain threshold and this is what everybody sort of
claimed the problem was solved with years ago but
well i mean this is once again a
yeah sure but i mean this is once again a very constrained task again i mean it's it's it's you you're almost assured it's only gonna
be a single speaker on the microphone so i mean the the only sorts of noise
you're gonna have to deal with uh is is is hiss or impulsive i would say or or that would be a good start
no no

yeah
yeah it was showing that um you haven't heard from him i take it either no
okay well it'd be nice to get the thesis i think there's a sort of just a research report sort of basis for this yeah
but
okay
yeah
apply some pressure

uh n no it should be looking towards the start of next year basically
the is it so i mean you should
okay which is
yeah and it's nice to get some feedback on i mean that feedback will probably come after your proposal possibly but um
yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly
n yeah sort out any bugs or whatever yeah
yeah i i i'd prefer to go back to the c t s  models i think as well 'cause i think i think they did work a little bit better so yeah
yep
hayes is another one isn't it oh okay sorry i was like 'cause i saw you sli i saw you looking at your watch before and i like wow gonna have to s have this ami corpus linked in no time
oh okay
uh not normally yeah it could go to thirty seven thirty eight yeah
yeah we've been told okay fine
yeah

could you ju just quickly rewind

yeah
okay oh
okay
okay
oh
okay
mm hmm
mm hmm
no no wait wait it's going very fast for me actually thing actually it's very fast so wha first
point the first thing you told me that you took the slides and you was and you had a l big dictionary
and you are seeing uh what what are the inside the slide right uh what the 'cause i first statement
i could not understand uh when you said the the st uh uh the
s uh the w yeah so we what's so yeah so could you please tell me little
bit more in detail yeah
no no no don't go that i i want the no i want to understand what did you mean by
the wo uh the te uh thing like saying that i took a dictionary and then a word from the slide and
what you are looking for i could not understand clearly clearly that
mm mm hmm
okay but do how do why do you want certain words like wha how do you expect that certain words
yeah
exactly
exactly
yeah
yeah
okay
mm hmm
okay
mm hmm
mm
yeah
mm hmm
yeah it appears in almost uh uh it is if it appears in all the slides it says a hundred percent correlation for me one percent well yeah
yeah
yeah
are like that
okay

okay
mm hmm
mm hmm
okay it's independent of each other okay

okay fine that's fine that's uh uh uh s certain words it should you have to
okay fine now i'm uh okay i'm into the loop mm hmm mm hmm

context
but it is implemented on the a s r  or uh where okay
okay
oh okay
yeah
else interpolate extrapolate yeah yeah
uh yeah
yeah
yeah


so you mea so uh you mean to say that um like when one case
you were saying that if you include the context and all those thing it helps in your a s r  improvement but it doesn't
which more subjective i think this whole
yeah
uh huh yes
yeah
mm
mm yeah you can do that yeah
or it could
mm
mm hmm

mm hmm
okay

so you so you so okay so maybe like it can be uh something like in a meeting it can be
like an unusual scenario for you in a presentation with a slide and
the unusual scenario that you're not using the uh slide at all

mm hmm
yeah
what are the other slide yeah


we have plenty of things to do
what track
yeah go on yeah it's no problem
okay so uh well so ultimately now the next step what is that because i want like kind of a uh so at first you said that okay now you did this
this correlation studies and they show that there's a very less correlation or in fact
no correlation kind of thing and uh um uh so uh so
what next in on top of it what you are going to build i mean is the question now
mm
yeah
mm hmm

yeah so t i mean to the different direction now that's what i mean to say what you like to take from there uh it's not defined yet okay
mm hmm
but what kind of problem we need a definition of some kind of uh problem right uh yeah

yeah


no no no
no but
yeah direction yeah that's that is a thing we go on to the next direction it should not that i it should not
happen that you're doing so many things and ultimately it doesn't goes into a thesis
the that's that should not the problem your thesis should be w in one direction one problem
and uh should go uh in one or uh one d yeah it it doesn't make sense
uh the it may be good as a c v  for you but then as a thesis you will have problems
uh defending it and all those things so what is that uh what would be the next possible direction you want
to take uh


error measure
it's yeah

yeah exactly
mm

s see that is going to tell us uh something like uh wha the thing is that i uh it
it see you can totally go into the text domain and be there you know it can be s no problem but as long as
uh it is okay but if you want to do with uh s like certain something
with the speed and all those things together then it's a different scenario uh you may not want
to work on all the problems someone may work on some other problem but then you you make use of that to
extend your work in some and uh and as i also t
it depends like also like i think if uh boss is interested in working in both speech
and text you can understand very well that part is also there
no the boss like have a it's like instead of saying like you should like work on both side you know the text and the speech aspect of it so yeah
yeah


yeah
yeah
yeah
uh w one thing interesting is what we came up in the discussion also you about telling that uh detecting
such scenarios where there is no relation between the slide and the person talking
that may be one good starting point for you actually and then at that point y uh you detect something
like that and then you show something like uh what you are saying that i if there
is uh if uh there i if it is out of discussion the words are no way are going to help your recognition
anyway a s r 
but if it is more on the um the slide information is not going to help you but uh
if it is uh if it is related to the sli what he is giving a presentation on the slide then you
show the your a s r  if you detect this even then you can show that how where you can
really help or not help because you say there's no correlation now but then here it comes that there
at some point there might be a correlation there
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah
yeah

so okay
mm hmm
mm
oh
mm hmm
okay
mm hmm
mm hmm
the th sides and the talk
yeah
yeah
okay
yeah

like another mic
th yeah most of the most of the time you have the title to do no the ami dat the ami data what that like that only most of the time you knew they had the word the word you are going to present everyone is presenting the same set of slide
yeah
what about m l m i  w the one we collected last year audio is very bad right yeah uh one single channel or at least a closed channel collection no

okay okay okay
it was good tha tha tha that
uh okay

so they are is there are still using that uh desktop microphone or what over there or
uh
ah


okay
okay that's fine yeah
yeah
it's a yeah it's a
yeah i understand okay so now there be uh would be some time wh what is we should be getting a time recording system right that uh uh uh so
mm
okay
lapel
should be okay
no it it's it's uh quite a bit yeah problem to do that kind of thing
yeah
mm
yeah but probably we were the f you know the post uh the the thing is somewhere projector
suppose there's like the the white board or whatever the presentation is over there the speaker
is more probably is going to this way or that way so probably you you may not need a very big microphone either probably one
or two uh uh ye uh yeah uh yeah


hmm
yeah
no the they the the the
chil may be interesting for you but it's a l uh well yeah it may be interesting for your problem i think y yeah no no no
yeah yeah it's more like tam but uh yeah the the their collection is much uh
uh like they have uh r t n s and all those thing people sitting and uh it's a lec it's a lecture uh a meeting collection
and i uh is it through n n uh l d a  or something
mm hmm
yeah so so probably we can yeah chil may be interesting actually you can look at it

in the text
mm
well but uh


s
yep
hmm

mm hmm
that's that's a yeah
that that they have
mm
they're talking fast i had a problem i like find the answer for my own yeah

so what about the figure things what happens if there's a figures coming on the slide so what do you want to do with that
on the s uh huh
either stop it
yeah
okay
okay

okay

okay
okay
okay
okay

yeah
usually in products and resources


okay so what are you going to do between the data when you collect and this
what do you want to do now by the time you get the data it's going to take another two months if i am right the whole capturing system when it is going to come so what is the next step

yeah you have to submit it in like two months also again yeah yeah to submit yeah it's one year right
for sure you you need it bad

call routing where that's inte
i think we should yeah

this is yeah
uh h oh
yeah
mm yeah


mm yeah
uh uh
uh yeah
yeah even if little bit of oh

this
uh ye yeah
yeah
no no i think you yeah it's uh it's huge yeah
it it it's non determinist
yeah that's what we expect to

yeah exa that's the intention there
sure
mm ye

no no no no no it i
yeah
surely they should they should have had that actually so maybe like we had to do this end point detection and probably
a little bit of final filtering and then i think you should be pretty much converging to the system
but the still the reason with the the they had like what are the systems we train on databases are they are chop neatly
that there is not too much silence beginning not too much silence at the end they are they are j they they chopped so neatly
for the it like custom made database but uh here it's not like that you know
like uh huh
yeah
there are the several things like one thing is like we can do this begin and end detection as we said or
you and he can uh we can try to use uh france telecom's uh approach actually
and that um uh uh they they have this front end which uh uh which
which can do a spectral and plus it can give you a voice activity detection
part f part from basis it can give so somethi we can just yeah we can
just run it quickly and see and probably you will have to run it will give you the idea that is it okay like
yeah no no no no uh not running i mean to say p probably uh he should run it or uh like we
can ge help him to run it actually because at some point he has to get into
uh
i mean to say i i mean to say that it's okay we have all the scripts but probably uh he should run it i mean to say
it's a
the all these experiments probably
uh the they are uh the scri because up to uh probably maybe we shall do mm it yeah uh for to make it faster we should ru it run maybe if we run f we ourself it it's very fast uh yeah
yeah
okay
mm okay
no but i mean to say that if you if you if you if you if you give him the scripts and ask him to run uh the
uh no yeah but it's uh
yeah
yeah oh yeah
yeah

yeah that uh huh no no no no i the end point system is different thing no that's and we need it for ami plus other thing and so but the i am to all saying yeah i i am
it's n it uh no no no it's not speech non speech uh uh it's uh it's uh it's yeah
yeah any anything nonsense or else it beeped
it's not silent it's uh you can say that's very yeah
and it can be it can be anything yeah breathing yeah
no anyway so we okay so we'll finish this call routing stuff what do you say all thi this is okay with you right so we'll k
because i think uh it it it has not been even submitted outside also the work what jean yves did
yet mm yeah not done that yet tried
uh yeah he still yeah

uh uh

yeah so yeah it it's pretty much good time also no and he c he can and uh when do you intend to start writing the proposal probably you should start i think s slow little bit start thinking

no no you you should not wait till the end that's what i mean to say uh yes because you
because it
okay
mm
mm hmm
uh yeah it can go there yeah
see
no no no i think it's uh it's good if he submits his pr proposal as a research report you put here submit it for the conference it's quite good for the proposal directly yeah yeah

no i think uh we we may have to like it can have a uh it's it's kind of like uh uh maybe
take like uh uh two or three days you know like to sit out and say uh one converge to one approach
and then just do without that yeah and probably yeah so that is the thing we have to sort out the bug kind
of thing and see how reliable is this end point detection for us yeah mm hmm
uh yeah i think uh then we can go back to c t s  actually

yeah
okay and uh yeah so that is this so you wanted to talk something more than that well we
obstructed you with that you wanted to talk something different also no
or maybe another meeting and then i say i don't remember no i
was just looking this okay uh we are not out of time you know
yeah
yeah yeah it's happened uh it happened with my friend like uh he was taking pictures pictures pictures and it was going
thirty seven thirty eight forty even so i said
there's some problem with yours uh your uh uh the way he uh put the roll inside there is some problem it
has got stuck somewhere it can never go to forty one forty
yeah i uh uh thirty seven thirty eight is fine forty forty one is but see he
has already don't listen okay
i feel like madonna with one of these on i said i feel like madonna with one of these on


right hello everybody back again for another wonderful meeting
is uh everyone ready
okay we c we can hold on for a minute
i figured with the spam thing if you can't beat it join in
are you ready
okay right well i take it that you are all ready now um
alright first off we'll just uh recap from our last meeting um
which was we got together just to basically decide on well to talk about what it is
that we were actually uh supposed to be doing and who we all are and stuff
like that mm get bit more of an idea together of what's going on
um what we are gonna talk about in this meeting is um
now that we know what it is that we are doing now we know that it's a t v  remote and stuff and you guys have just
been off doing some some uh r  and d  for that that's research and
development for those that haven't heard that before see i'm learning all sorts of new technologi terms in technology
today um yeah we're gonna hear your uh th three little presentations
whether they be on computer or on the whiteboard or whatever you want
um i'd like to um hear
o i'd like to hear who's g who's on the um from from uh
catherine actually first i want what i'd like to hear about is uh if we've finally
decided on um what sort of energy we're gonna be using and
it's just that yeah let's let's hear from you first
get yourself in position
i don't think any of us remember the fifties
do sol solar panel things do they have to work from the sun or can they work from a light bulb
does anybody know
okay
mm
okay jolly good
what's a double curved one
okay
so that might be an idea of using the rubber but then it should you know yeah
when a t v  programme's got one watching the match and your team's just lost you can fuzz it across the room and it'll bounce off the wall back at you yeah i like that idea
rubber we're all we're all going we're all liking that idea you think you can market that
ooh we like rubber ooh
uh huh
well we're gonna go with i think we've decided that it's gonna be a rubber case so
push buttons instead of the wheel
rubble double double
i'll have a big mac please
let's have rubber push buttons hey
yeah

simple yeah
chip on print it's a bit

okay uh what i'm not understanding here
is uh okay advanced chip on print which i presume is like one p c b  and that's got all the electronics on one board including the um infra red sender
right um what a what alternatives do we have to that
y um what alternatives do we have to the chip on print
so it sounds
so why would we not go for that if it's something that's inside the the unit
i it doesn't affects whether the customer's gonna buy it or not um
we wanna go for an i i all so long as it works
you know so let's not let's uh not bother with the chip on print
yeah
s yeah push buttons
what about what
well what do we need a speaker for in a remote control unit
s
yeah it's not something that we wanna t go into with this product
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah yeah
yeah
basic battery it's cheap it's cheerful it's worked does work
we were go we were going with the late with the the r s i  rubber weren't we
the the
the double whopper please
yep but we're going for the simple buttons
yeah and it's cheapest all round it sounds kinda funky and we can also
market it as i 'cause we were s saying earl you were saying earlier in your research that um the
the people have the r  people were getting the complaining about r s i  and this is anti r s i 
so that's another marketing point that we can use
but anything is gonna have buttons
even if it's a jog wheel it's still repetitive
you
you see you can still get it does you still get repetitive strain injury whether you are pressing a button or pressing a flat bit of screen it's the v it's the fact that you are pressing the same doing the same movement it's not actually what you are doing
but the fact that this this rubber i is actually used in these anti r s i  ps specific
yeah
and you know yeah you can fuzz it across the room and throw it at throw it at your children yeah
okay gabriel let's um let's let's hear from you about the um it's the interface
great
mm
mm
mm
yeah
mm hmm
yeah
yeah
yeah
do we have an uh example of a good one
brilliant
yeah
mm hmm
okay well let's um so w what are our definite decisions on this then as a team the um
the the um the interface type we're going for
just the simple s simple straight set of buttons
yeah
yeah
yeah
okay and we're not yeah are we gonna hav hav an are we d have we decided on whether
w we're gonna s supplement it with anything you know colours or particular gimmicky bits to it we're not we're just gonna go for something
we're
yeah
yeah okay okey dokey
yeah i don't have any other questions on this
let's move over to
yeah sure
yeah the button that just does that yeah
cool
mm yeah
mm hmm

yeah why should people buy this when they're already got a remote that came with the t v 
what's that mean
okay now the trouble is is we've already decided that we're going with the stuff that works already that's cheap
yeah
maybe we could um
of course they do one hundred per cent that's your first thing you go oh i'm not gonna buy that 'cause i dunno if it works or not
okay well what do you two think about this
yeah what i don't understand what m
yeah and it this is just gonna all this is being used for is your television
it would that would mean you'd need a television that has bluetooth in it which no no television does does it
that would mean we'd have to make a television as well
no that would be your telephone in with your television
yeah and i
nah the televi the television would have to be a bluetooth compatible basically an and there is no there is no such thing
okay
okay yeah this that's that's very good
and and this is all tying in very nicely the fact that it's made out of this
rubber we can throw it about th we should encourage people to throw their remote
controls about because it charges itself up by doing it
but yeah by the squeezing it the
yeah that's a great idea well done
yeah
i wanna watch the pineapple channel
well spongy that's where yeah we're we're ahead of the game there
okay
alright yeah no this i this is good so through all that we've we go we're right we're gonna go go back to
um going with the kinetic thing that's great using the spongy
rubber that we were talking about that anti r s i  you can as you squeeze it you are not only therapeuticising
yourself you are charging the batteries and um
i'm not sure about the buttons being in the shape of fruit though
yeah this is true

well okay it seems like the only thing that we haven't really finally um agreed on is
its image
like yeah we're we're saying no we don't want it to be fruit and vegetables but we dunno what it should be or like are we going yeah it looks slick but what do what do we mean by slick sort of thing
i mean you said earlier on i it should be funky
l keep it clean keep it clean
bright but not too bright
like the volume buttons should be the all the same colour and the d and the the channel buttons should be one colour and stuff like that do you mean
okay what
okay
tha
yeah i mean we that's we we
yeah
this is the remote control tomato

yeah
well it's it's gotta be chew proof


so what are you saying maybe we should market it in different colours for different so we could do like the pink range the blue range the green range the
mm
well that's that can be down to bit of market researching you know if that's easy enough to find out what colours are more popular
mm
okay alright well um we'll alright let's what we're gonna aim to get together by the next meeting then um
is
from you catherine wi your y y you know you're gonna be working on the the look and feel design
um gabriel you're gonna be working on you know come up with the the user interface design then basically you two are gonna be working together on this you won't be going off to your separate offices
um and i think you are gonna get a chance to play with some clay
i think yeah it's gonna you know come up ki you know be ab for the next meeting be able to come in and
show us some some i some physical ideas 'cause at the moment uh you know it's it's hard
we were kinda going yeah it's gotta feel nice it's gotta look cool and that it's you know now we can actually start
you know s some sort of physical something or other
um and you're gonna be working on the product evaluation
um
and i
will be uh
talking to the bosses basically and uh
f fielding off some more spam and
uh
that's it really
keeping things t well uh you know ho hopefully uh keeping things together um
yeah that's
this is this is uh good so we know for definite we know we've we've now got some
definite things going on we definitely know how it's powered we definitely know that um it's gonna be a simple buttons
we're not gonna be going for the new technological chip on print expensive things so we've we're keeping the costs
down it's this rubber casing that we can sell as
um fun and funky don't know of any other remote controls that are made out of this stuff
people you know people are saying oh standard stuff gives you repetitive strain injury well this
remote control is designed to do the complete opposite
it's supposed to fix it rather than cause it um
you know we're gonna we we're gonna as a sort of extra something on it you know what what extra things are there extra things this product have we'll look into this lock key
facility although whether or not it happens or is possible i don't know but something to look into
okay i think that's um well done everybody
anyone have any uh
any questions everyone know what they're doing 'cause if you don't you'll i'm sure you'll soon get an e mail about it
okay right well it's um we're we've still couple of minutes until our meeting's due to finish
but um
i got a note saying that you two who are gonna be working together so bef before you all disappear off just
hold hold fire um
um i think it's uh yeah i think it's gonna be par part more of a profit sharing on the product
yeah i think i i think that's i think that's the way it's gonna happen at the moment
yeah yeah
i want a share in the space rocket did you see that this k that this company we've made a spaceship
yeah
yeah
yeah
mm
and the spaceship doesn't have the r  have a massive r  and r  down the side of it but i still want one
okay um i've just had a sign flashing up saying finish the meeting
uh
yeah
yeah it's not telling it's not saying do anything in particular just yet so maybe you should go back to your own offices
yeah
yeah it says you two

almost
mm 'kay

no no no no it's fine i'm just preparing
okay where is that thing oh sorry couldn't see
would that work
okay so that's me again um so um
for the energy sources we can have a basic battery a hand dynamo which is
which was used uh in the fifties for torches if you remember that kind of which wouldn't be v
wouldn't be v v yeah yeah it wouldn't be very fancy you can have a kinetic provision of energy
which is used on some watches these days so if you have just a bit of gentle movement that it will give
it the energy to work or you can use solar cells but i'm not sure about that indoors really
but
yeah
i dunno actually
i dunno
um
think the the uh what would cost the less would be the basic battery really and
uh if we want something fancier i think the kinetic provision of energy could
be nice but i don't know if it's worth the cost so we've got to discuss that
for the case of the remotes itself um they can be a general case which is just a flat one you can have uh a curved one or a double curved one if you know what i mean so
you know kind of more ergonomic that kind of suits the palm of your hand that kind of thing
so
um then the case material itself so it can be uh uh either plastic or latex
uh rubber wood or titanium and th for each of them you have uh cases where
for example titanium you can't use it for if you if we're choosing a double curved case we
can't choose titanium and if we are choosing um solar cells then we can't choose latex
for the case material so we just have to take that into account but if we're choosing just the flat case then
we can go for anything and i think we discussed earlier on the r  s  i 
problem thing so we could uh
yeah
yeah and also it doesn't break as easily maybe i dunno

so rubber would be
okay
uh s so if d okay
and then there are the push buttons so you can have basic push buttons or a scroll wheels like you have on a mouse um or you could have um l c d  which gives you a display
um scroll buttons as well
so if you use a rubber double curved case you must use rubber push buttons
so if we're going for rubber then we have to decide for the case um and if we choose double
curved then we have to go for rubber push buttons so it's a constraint
yeah but is it a double curved one or not if it's not a double curved then we've got the choice for the push buttons if it's a double curve we've gotta go for rubber push buttons
if that makes sense
yeah
no but na le you see you've got okay the energy that's one thing
then you have the case is uh whether it's flat or curved and that's
we don't care if it's rub rubber or not but then we've decided that we going for rubber for the case material
so if we've chosen rub rubber and if now we have the choice
for the case whether it's flat single curved or double curved and i'm just saying if it if we choose it to
be double curved then we need to go i dunno why but we need to go for uh rubber push buttons
so either
i dunno we just need to decide on the on the case
let's go crazy and then do i have a last slide yes i do um
so the push buttons themselves they can be just simple or they can be so that's just the electronics between the but behind
the push buttons um and the price that go with it with it so the simple
push buttons are gonna be the cheapest uh if we get a scroll wheel that's a higher
price range if we get an advanced chip which is um used for
the l c d  the display thing then that's even more expensive
mm
yeah
the infra red
yeah
well if if it's not chip on print then i guess you get different chip components and you build them separately and doesn't include the infra red it's less expensive mm
technically speaking it's not as advanced but it does the job too
fo
it doesn't yeah yeah yeah
totally
yeah
so let's not go for the
yeah yeah i agree
so it's either um the scroll wheel or the push buttons
well
it'd be it'd be cool but they are saying they've just developed it i'm just guessing but it's gonna be the most expensive option probably and
hm
just if you are really lonely maybe
channel five and then it switches on

okay so i'll go back maybe to the previous slide and we can decide for each problem what we should choose so for the energy source do we go for the battery or the
cheaper option are you happy with that okay so we'll go for the battery
then the case do you want it flat or curved or sing or double curved
double
okay so then if we use double curved case then we have to u choose rubber push buttons and that's fine
p
yeah
i thought they would give an option of flat buttons or a
that they don't
mm

alright that's me done
sorry


well
bluetooth would for example enable you i think to um um connect for example you if you get a w call on your mobile phone but your mobile phone is downstairs or something you would get on your television you're being called by this person right now
things like that
no i
no but if you get bluetooth on the remote you'd be able to
i with the television yeah i was just trying to find an advantage wha what w what advantage would you get for the
maybe the kinetic mo provision of energy then it's been done for watches but i haven't seen that for remotes yet
change the batteries ever again
yeah well and in little characters you say yeah but not too much


yep
no vegetables
well yeah but apple would sue you for that
sued the beatles so



yeah
why not

i'm gonna write that down

that's yeah
although i'd be curious to see how many uh
you know there are some colours that i wouldn i would never choose and i would be curious how many people choose that colour
mm
and produce less of the silly colours maybe

yep
alright
mm
cool
it is

great



that's true
doesn't
yeah
are we taking these off

hello
yeah

that's the kind of spam that everybody likes to receive

hmm
do you have any preference uh of order
i think she is still finishing her
hmm
okay it's uh
is it like a crank thing or something
well there's sometimes combinations i mean like calculators do combinations of battery with but also using some solar power
uh i think it has to be on the on the solar energy but i don't know
let's have a squeezable remote


if it's rubber isn't it malleable anyway it doesn't matter if it's double i mean isn't a rubber case mean it's completely
flexed i mean it it flexes to whatever they want it to mean so what's the difference between a normal rubber case and a rubble
doub double rubber double curved case
okay
okay go rubber go rubber the whole way
i think push buttons is
yeah
th the the speech recognition um option is it doesn't seem really very promising for us uh 'cause uh
the yeah the example that they're already using it for is with the coffee machine where basically you can program a sample wi um
that when you say something it will give a response and you program the response as well just uh clips of tha that you record yourself
so you can program your coffee maker that when you say good morning to it it says hello rick or whatever but
i mean it's not it would be one thing if it was speech recognition where you say something and it turns the t v  on like turn the t v 
on and i turns comes on but it's not that it just gives you a it just gives you a verbal response so yeah i mean
like what's the point of saying hello remote i mean hello how how are you
yeah if you're really lonely it is it's
no tha that w that w that would be more promising it it's just a remote that talks to you uh i mean to certain cues
'kay
yeah i'm fine with the basic battery
hmm
yeah so we want it rub rubber double curved
so rubber rubber keys yeah
yeah
yeah we're giving them a way to burn off steam basically yeah
not that watching t v  should be that stressful
oh yeah i guess t v  can be stressful yeah if you're watching sports
alright
alright
yeah some of what i have to say ties into what catherine was just talking about
okay so i'm continuing with the user interface uh topic and so basically
i consulted with our manufacturing division it sounded like catherine was also speaking with them
uh i also took uh reissa's marketing findings from the last meeting into
consideration um 'cause i think that's that's crucial as far as uh what keys we're going to
inc inclu what buttons we are going to include and and how they're laid out uh and so the manufacturing
division uh sent some some samples of of uh interface components that we might be interested in using
that have been used in other products uh like the coffee machine
so i already mentioned the speech recognition interface i guess we we basically vetoed that idea it's it's pointless
uh it's just a sample sensor sample output it would just be probably the most expensive part of our remote
without any actual interesting functionality as far as operating the t v  uh
so yeah they they also give the uh they they suggested the idea of using a spinning wheel like you use on the
side of an m p  three player like ipod um so we've already addressed that and i think that would actually be worse for something
like r s i  i mean you got that thumb movement that you're constantly doing um the other suggestion
and i i have a feeling that
we're interested in in something more general but they suggested uh you know going i a little bit into a
a niche like either gearing our remote towards kids where you could have lot of colours um the keys
might be you know funny or or or uh something for the elderly
where the remote's very large and the buttons are very large and there's only a few buttons but you know we can
we can discuss this but it sounded like from our last meeting we really wanted something that was general but done well uh
um
so the key layout and design are really crucial you don't want uh you want people to be able to quickly access the buttons that they use
a lot without uh always pressing the wrong one um and i didn't mention that we need a power button
in our last i can give you an example here of uh good layout and bad layout
uh
from our manufacturing department so this would be an example of bad layout where you have volume up and volume down but they have a v  on both of them so uh
it's sort of confusing for the user uh this is
the example of the giant remote that's impossible to lose
and for something for kids
yeah um
and so
yeah i th i think my personal preferences of we've all kind of talked about and seemed to be on the same page um
uh so i was against the speech recognition and against going uh towards anything in in a niche
sense i think it should be more general i didn't i didn't think the spinning wheel or the uh l c  display were were
crucial for us and yeah that's it for me
so we're we're not gonna have any sort of display i think uh so yeah it's just gonna be just gonna be push buttons um
i think we shall have a limited number of buttons ideally i mean a a power channel up channel down volume up volume down and a numerical keypad
uh
and some sort of it will either have a a lock button like we mentioned or or a cover or something like that i guess it's to the point where we need to decide about that
well now that we've decided on our
um it seems like we wouldn't wanna make it too busy and too sort of gaudy but um
yeah i would say mayb maybe a couple of colours like uh like a black with with yellow and somewhere like maybe the r r  can be yellow or something like that
i i guess the fact uh also that we are having a rubber case uh
would prevent us from having the cover function that we thought of before i mean 'cause uh s so if we wanna
have a lock of some sort it would have to be a button but i think that should be i mean um
i can speak with the button department but uh i think that it should be easy to have a button that just prevents prevents the other
uh the other buttons from operating so that should be simple
mm
yeah
well it should be it should be maybe cutting edge in some sense i mean have something that's little more technologically advanced than what's on the market
yeah
yeah actually i mean these first two points we've already sort of gone away from 'cause our rubber one is not fancy i mean it's different but i wouldn't say like a rubber remote is fancy if that's what people want then we maybe we're going in the wrong direction and it's it's not technologically innovative either
mm
so is is the advantage of bluetooth that you can just like synchronise it with other
electronics
yeah that's basically what it allows you to do right
yeah the that wouldn't be the remote so much i mean
mm
yes so can
yeah we can make the squeezing of the rubber be the be the generating like the energy generator

we're all about that
okay so we could have keys that are like a b like a broccoli key and a uh and an avocado key on them
yeah that's great for us
right
yeah
yeah that's great
yeah i don't know how we incorporate
we don't have to follow every trend i guess
uh huh
the power button could be like a big apple or something
they don they don't own all images of apples
okay we'll make it a uh pomegranate a big pomegranate
yeah
yeah
mm
sure
the one thing i'm wondering about i hope that we're not going like too much down a gimmicky road of of having i mean
if somebody go goes into the store they're gonna see like three or four normal remotes and then a big spongy pink
t tomato uh remote i mean what are ninety per cent of people gonna take

mm
yeah i mean that that seems to work well with for products like ipod where you know you have a variety of colours that people feel like they're customising it when they buy it even you know just just by the fact of choosing
right
yeah
okay
oh right
yeah
that sounds good
mm
right
alright
yeah
yeah
mm i think we all know what we need to do now
okay
okay i'll stay in here

does the pay raise immediately come into effect on our next pay check or is that
so we're buying fut i mean we're getting futures in the company
so we really have a incentive to make this remote work
i'd like to share in the coffee machine profits because that's really doing well
yeah
this company has its its fingers in a lot of different pots
yeah we're definitely not in the money making department
well i i did notice looking at i mean they told you that they wanted whatev our product to represent the the r r  brand and and to be immediately noticeable
i mean if you look like at the coffee maker at the at the corporate web page it's not obvious
r r  well it is to us because we we worked worked here for years and we use that coffee machine but it's doesn't have the colour scheme of of the of the company anywhere on it obviously it's just sil silver and black
no
mm

okay
right well i guess that's us
okay right
oh right okay
i cover myself up
i've always wanted one of these i really have where do you buy 'em from
they're


yeah

oh my gosh






mm hmm


batteries
it's here

ah

mm
mm
mm
yeah
mm
i think rubber's
but after my after my fashion thing i think you'll realise that rubber is more
people

what about the just developed uh sample sensor
g there the sample sensor sample speaker thing
mm i dunno
be cool channel two
oh it just gives an answer
oh then then
i thought i thought it was when they said
i thought when they said voice recognition they meant um like channel five and it will change like you talk to it can i have channel five oh then forget about it oh right okay
mm
mm yeah
so it will look like something like this
yeah
well the rubber push buttons
don't you have to move your
mm
mm yeah the rubber's good
yeah so they can sit there and go like



mm
mm
that does get annoying
uh huh
well

maybe we can
right
well i'm just basically letting you know what's happening in the markets
and what the fashions are for next year um
so yes so from looking at this year's trends and fashions and also
recent investigation that we've done in the remote control market we have found that for the remote control
market these are like most important aspects like that we really need to which we've already probably discussed
um the most important aspect is look and feel so the remote control has to look and
feel fancier than the ones that already that we already have so it has to be
yep
exactly um second uh it should be technologically innovative innovative so
technologically it should be like um work basically i guess it should work
should
that's new
yeah
yeah
mm
so no loose
that's why i was thinking bluetooth 'cause if you like put up bluetooth and it's like a bluetooth remote control everybody's gonna like oh 'cause
bluetooth is the in thing nowadays like it really is like people and um
when it comes to marketing like that's what people go for they don't really care whether you know
at the end of the day whether it works properly or not
well they do but it's like it's not
yeah but it looks good if it looks good and it's it can just be there for decoration
but like
you could always insert yeah
yeah but i mean people like
well if you're looking at if you looking at something that's going to be bought by people you have to make it new you have to make it state of the art
well it doesn't
like it doesn't have to be you know bluetooth that was just an idea but like it needs do something that you know is new whether it's a battery it could be something really
really minor you know like but i think we are really keeping to what is already out there and people've already seen it people've already got it if we want something new we need to move away from what we already have
and um just go creative
and then you can market it never have to change a battery again

i think safety s
yeah
third most important aspect uh is it's easy to use and i think we've all
um worked that out um okay in the fashion how it's supposed to look next year's fashion i very
much in fruit and vegetables are thm are like the theme for cloths shoes and furniture
so next year people will be buying i found this really funny
you know strawberry shaped chairs
and things
yeah rubber things
um and as it's rubber the feel which is in this year is spongy so it's it's not quite spongy but spongy i would say is yeah so we're in
yeah and so personal what i was just saying like move away from the current remote controls uh like the look and the feel of the current ones and change the look and feel while still keeping to the company's image basically
so yeah
i had to say
so we're moving in the right direction like

mm


maybe make it like fruity colours or something
some sort
or
mm

well
i think if it's rubber
it needs to be
different i think it's it should be i mean what do you associate with rubber you know like
really different colours basically okay sor i sorry i used the wrong word what do you associate with the mate
the material that material um
um like i'm just thinking bright colours
bright natural colours nothing
too
bright but too not yeah like no lime green or bright yellow or bright pink wanna make it different colours so anybody can choo like like
yeah and on the back of it have the logo

well
i can say in this country you'll get you know lots of people wanting something really funky and cool
like and kids will be walking in with their parents saying mummy i wanna buy that one and uh parents will see the will see the pro as well because it's um
like kids won't break it it's not breakable if you throw it around especially with younger kids you know they can pick it up and and
yeah the only thing is is that really small kids might chew on it but
yeah so so it's rea it's quite it's quite like um
user friendly and also for different families like like family use
as well so for little kids and for old ki like teenagers will like it i think especially maybe younger girls if
it's in pink they'll be like pink remote control for their room something
yeah
so like you walk in you're like oh i like that remote control because it's so bright and then and then the shop assistant comes up and says oh
what colour would you like and then they go like oh i can choose the colour wow so it puts i think even the customer into more control
over what they're buying instead of you've got all colour it's either that or nothing so they also get to pick
well personally i like walking into a shop and choosing a colour
it's um
yeah
mm
d you've got the
evaluation


mm
yeah

s
this gives you all the details

um

yeah

mm

mm
uh fourth meeting

some extra deciding
well
i'll show you the notes again very interesting well you'll you two will uh present us your prototype
then um i guess that's your bit i i didn't s see anything about it so i already
uh thought you uh you were to do that so the you're uh i'll show you how
we're going to do with financing this uh design
and then we'll evaluate after after we have redesigned it because uh well we'll see about the costs um we'll uh evaluate our p our uh production
and then uh we can close
well the finance uh we'll do later so um firstly uh i'll show you the notes i don't think it's very interesting
oh nei uh no
alright
this is copy paste so
of course you had some very strange layout well um
we ge we went through the agenda and well we had some uh some presentations from you three and uh i summarised what you said to us so uh i don't think it's very interesting and go through it again so uh
this is what we decided it's also copy paste from what we made together so we still know that and then uh we can we can uh use the time better
well uh next you two will uh present uh the pot prototype for us
yeah
correct
yeah
mm hmm
mm
yeah alright
okay
yeah
alright
mm hmm
alright
so
'kay
well if i look at it the side the side view
oh yeah alright yeah

mm hmm
okay
yeah

okay
w
well i see but
well yeah i see it
yes
when i look at uh when i look at this side view i think w when i have that in my hand it's terrible if if you look if if this this is thick and this is thin th th then it that it lies over your hands but
well what what what i what i agree is that when uh when um you have such of uh an arc in the middle so that the the a the ends and the
fronts is a bit thicker so th then it falls over your hands
and how large is it

well uh
well the sides i haven't seen yet uh
they the the the the the side view we didn't uh

yeah

no no no
yep
okay

yeah well uh i think uh if you t if you three uh agree then then that's it
yes so uh i c i c well we'll we we'll do it like this alright if you think that that's the way it should
no no when i i my personal taste is that i want it to fall over my hands with a thick but
in the market uh
no not totally for me i i wouldn't buy it let's say it like that
no
yes but
yeah we don't know but that's uh that's that's that's more market research so let it be like this at uh at this moment okay
no i think it's great
comes to that later um you uh c you can uh walter you can do the evaluation uh criteria on this
that's more useful
than just speaking
yes

mm hmm
'kay
yeah we're we're not quite uh objective about this
to the customers to potential customers who have to take this questionnaire
nei oh no i know i know i know but um well we can go uh because of the time uh pretty quick through this uh do we find it good looking well we think so uh
yeah
well one
well so it's point four
easy to find t
two
no i totally agree we we have to get get on go through this
no not false
it's one
well uh two y well we have to go through it
yep
two
well no we didn't implement anything about that
well six then
are the functions easy to learn well w i we do want we have a l f f less of an
and the device r s i  sensitive
yeah
ah

yeah but just do some we we
i th i th i think this is too time consuming uh not not towards you but towards this all th this is
we you have to put it to the customers
uh well well a bit so four
yes
one and features included also one
and one uh those uh nine uh is the fancy looking uh we still think so
device fancy feeling yeah cool man
are there enough technology yeah well also we have two
is the device easy to use yes we have not many buttons
two three
are the trends about fruit and vegetables implemented well in our covers in our fronts so yes one is the material attractive

oh okay okay
is the material attractive well the titanium is strong and uh the rest f uh the buttons feel soft so i would say at least two
okay
well yeah
yes but we we have to design much more because there was some irritating account manager coming to me
um
oh
uh
yes well look at the costs at this point
i had to fit it in
i twelve and a half
so
well what costs a lot the sample spea costs four
the sample speaker the s sensor
kick it out we have to go to twelve and a half the speaker costs far by far the most
it it isn't worth it
we could make two different versions one with and one without but for this
so zero
then we go to fourteen point six
well the titanium i don't want to lose actually
l c  three yeah hand dynamo y t come on w a remote control has a battery
well be for the l c d  uh you had said
well what what's the difference between simple and regular
what's the difference between a simple and a regular chip
and simple
nothing
well
your part
what happens if we do
how much do we win one

yeah
well we could say well this special colour that isn't that that isn't there because the the fronts they will buy it the special colour
yeah then you s then you only have one half left
uh yeah
yeah
yeah
no the advanced chip is needed to have an l c d  display
says his uh that was in the second meeting i think
well i i did single curve to well you said s double curved uh he because uh i thought it's a b a bit cheaper already we can also make it flat
but
curved yes that's curved
yes
no it's one curve
one curve simple
we have a big financial problem
well then we have two dollars less profit come on if we if we if we make this fifty million they won't hesitate to uh congratulate us so uh
by the way we also have this one
oh costs nothing that's nice plastic is
yes but i just got it
who
you want to dump the titanium
and make all plastic then we ha then we're there
th then you have a ugly stupid l ugly looking dumb remote that that no one would buy
no i don't think so
yes and the feel and th that it is strong and
we still we had to focus to get more people from the younger group but not lose the one
why can't i
i'll put in the report we that we think that fourteen point one is the l m lowest price you can make a remote for that's trendy d these days
i i'll talk to the managers
titanium i thi i think this this is this is e really good re remote but
ah those those account managers what do th d what do they know come on riot
yes yes
one and a half euros hmm
so
well no it's just uh all plastic well alright huh
four so
but then we can add the special colour
as we have money over uh left
and we still have money left what do we want guys

yes
y oh no alright
safe
so alright
finance
well guys guys we have to dump our titanium and we'll hate the managers for that
but now we're going to evaluate our project of uh project project well
satisfaction on for example are we satisfactory about our creativity

i think it's terrible that we got uh those costs at the last moment that's really bad but that that that's that yeah that's a reason but also for our creativity we had um nice design and then you get the cost and you had to dump all your creativity

yeah
well alright
uh leadership next uh teamwork
uh yeah well i think so also i al i i've uh filled that in in a the questionnaires uh each time so well the managers were terrible
so with their all their
useless requirements but o alright the teamwork
no they said oh we won't d uh we won't uh use teletext uh we won't use the d v d 
alright teamwork well great i think
uh well what do you what did you think about the smartboard
well
it's also a it's both the smartboards
i liked this smartboard but i hated that one well it's both a smartboard
no
it's both a smartboard but this one is used for a desktop and that one is used to to draw
well wi w which one did you like
that one
yeah
yes th that is so
we're now talking about the smartboards
or install a laptop to a beamer or have this one standing here in an i i like it
okay alright
yeah yeah it is
so
and uh the digi the digital pen did uh did you like that one
i used it uh just to check it out but uh
you you can't send that to anyone because you you've scrabbled something on a page for yourself and then you're going to send it yeah well no
it's no it it's useless
yes
for drawings yes
but
but for notes it i you you have to put that in a strict uh you have to put a name standard date
and all those things and notes uh for a meeting are very strict so if you uh were to write
them down for yourself and then put that in your computer you still have to type it over to word so it doesn't d doesn't
have any
yep alright um etcetera well uh the laptops
of course great
yeah you can b by my
yeah other uh things we used here i hated the cameras i hated the microphones but no
no no i haven't looked w one time directly at the camera i don't care about it
well w why not uh etcetera we n new ideas found what kind of ideas for n a future schedule what for future um meetings you have got
chatting and emailing
well new ideas found by this
not nothing we don't want this we hate this
digital pen is useless so yeah for drawings
but uh two t but uh th then you have to have a lot of drawings because if i had a company and i'm going to uh buy those expensive huge expensive uh things i and i have to w
pay those uh papers uh that are expensive i'm not going to uh
well th then still they they they should have a a nice graphics programme on the laptop because this is huge uh this v very very uh expensive paper
yeah
well no i hated to draw like that you you can't draw anything uh neat
i if it if it would be perfect following
well th th then still it's it's it's very expensive uh towards a a just a green uh school board
yep
yeah yeah

yep
yeah
well they are now
it is so congratulations crew se
finally my beer well that's it i think um i don't know how long we still have i dunno how long uh we had for this last meeting but uh
well yeah it is a bit uh well we still have to make the end report and uh all those things i have to do that
i di did you um save this one in the folder can you do that
i don't know what you have to do

yeah
oh it worked two times quick cool
this is nice
uh
d design
s oh he saved them all ten well alright um
yeah
well

where is this

i also think so she already knows she big brother
our manager
yeah i don't think so
alright
we put the fashion in electronics but we couldn't because of the costs that that's the title
of our uh end document we couldn't put the fashion into the electronics
yeah that's a nice title
oh
well
i'm going to resign after this project anyway so
we have to do what
oh
mm
bit late
i think it is

alright
no you go and i'll uh
supplement you
yeah
yeah it's a double r  but
it's a double r 
but it's very difficult to to draw that in yeah
oval yeah
channel up and volume
yeah
menu for the l c d  screen

well at the back
yeah
no the back with the logo and our uh l uh
no i don't think
and the
and about the side view um
this the front won't be as thick but again th the the drawing technique makes it very difficult to to really uh
well it won't be visible
mm
yeah
if y
if you handle a remote you you usually don't have your hand straight like this you you have it a bit uh yeah
yeah

well they lay there all the time
yeah yeah


yeah you you don't you don't grab it you you

yeah
hmm
that way it it falls into your hand i think
no but but

well f for as far as i can see three of us agree and only nils
but you're the project manager you can make the hard decisions
yeah
mm


but what about the redesigning
okay



hmm
mm
well we designed it to be good looking
hmm
yeah we designed it to be good looking so

hmm
i think we shouldn't discuss any points points that long because i don't know how how many points there are but uh yeah
yeah
um no it's uh

with two huge buttons
well it's easier to find than a a normal black one or something because of the colour but

we have so few functions so yeah
well i should i think two because the voice recorder is n not self learning

yeah
yeah
the
two two
t
yeah
one or two another two
well three
mm yeah
this is the last meeting yeah
yeah
the what
oh

um
well well why why why should we use a advanced chip
yeah can't we do that with a regular chip
why not
yeah regular is normal
simple
elementary
we we we why we have very little options furthermore for the
uh well we have to put that in
nah
yeah you must change the chip uh back
you must change the chip back nils
hmm no we oh
you you we have an advanced chip on print and we have an l c  display i think that's a bit double y we don't need both
says
i
one curve
well we make it more expensive to buy

yeah or we could replace it
why why don't we replace the titanium with uh
plastic coloured titanium uh titanium coloured plastic
yeah well if we uh we we have to get cheaper
but then we we've got to uh run through the eval evaluation process again
ah no no
it's not ugly looking the looks remain the same
well i do think so
feel
yeah alright but then we we won't get there
we can dump the special colour we l we use plastic and plastic is already in colour i think
no nothing
amen
yeah
yeah
but
no no no no w titanium stays there

well

no because we did not know anything about it
yeah but then we've got money left
yeah
yeah w
well i think uh the case is double curved then
because you y have that curve and you have that curve
yeah well uh
well y we have curves in all directions

i mean this this ain't titanium but it looks like it


pro project


yeah
yeah
and uh unrealistic
well we we we used our creativity but we just had to adapt it to the costs
nei uh no
terrible
leadership well
yeah yeah




right yeah
no that's a smartboard and that's a digital pen or not
oh they're both smartboards


yeah
but i i think this is meant by the digital pen
yeah
well we we used that one and we needed it i think
yeah alright but
yeah i like that one but that one is terrible

well i i drew this mm and i made a mistake but it it would have been uh useful if i i could show this on the screen
yeah for drawings
n notes mm
mm


yeah
but then uh it's really useful i think
yeah hmm

thanks project manager

well i did

well i missed uh the option to uh
to email yeah email or chat or something
yeah alright but that's one n new idea

yeah
no it isn't
yeah
so it isn't useless

yeah
well you you can't you can't draw on a laptop like you like you paint of or draw with your hand
with the mouse it is no
uh indeed
yeah but but then you can uh save it in instantly and and and re use it and uh


hmm
hmm
celebration
yeah we can go to the bar and uh with our newly earned money
yeah

oh
no no no no no
but nils you've got some work left
i have to go to a physiotherapy
wow
yeah it is handy
well they they wanted everything we produced so
my big bird

i think you have we have to make clear to her that we are ready
close your laptop
so she can see we're ready


yeah let's take this remote into uh production



she's on the move

w what alri alright we'll see

yeah

yeah that's important too yeah
alright
from me of course yeah well from us all yeah from all of us yeah it's a nice chorus yeah

repeat it yeah alright
alright we both uh will or one of us will uh
alright if i make mistakes uh you'll uh
right uh well this is our design uh it's pretty uh much uh like uh mike draw uh drew uh the in the during the last meeting with uh the different uh perspectives of it uh we'll begin uh with the front
we have of course uh the the round shape uh the round uh basic shape um with uh the upper part being the front th so there's this part um which is made of hard plastic the front
and uh we're we're using different colours of course for the launch we use the basic ugly colours and later we'll
put out uh more interesting covers with different patterns and pictures and everything but basically different colours
bright colours not black too dark fancy colours um then we have
uh the lower part
of the of the device uh which is of course um part of the back actually because it's also titanium
you can see it also on the on the on the side view that only this part is the front and
the rest of it the under uh the under side uh of it yeah the back side and the lower part of the front
is of course titanium made of titanium and has the titanium colour of course the look
um then we have uh on back on the front uh the logo in the upper corner uh which is uh made uh which is also part of the back part of the titanium uh titanium part yeah
it's a double r  yeah the logo uh uh it's difficult to draw so small but it's our double r  uh logo is in there um so that's the logo in the upper lef uh right corner
then we have the buttons uh it's difficult to draw again the little oval or round i think oval will be better for the for the d for the different uh channel buttons
so uh oval n those are here and then we have the m
the m
yeah the the con the the the yeah the t volume and the channel controls uh in the middle here um
um with kind of arrow shapes which makes it also a bit more exciting than basic round or
um uh
uh square buttons and also here are the two uh buttons we agreed on we have the okay button
oh nei we uh the okay button's here in the middle of the of the operators of the channel and uh volume
um changers and then we've here the menu button and the
and the video button the yeah and of course this low part this is the l c d  screen
uh this is what we made of it you can make uh suggestions uh if you want
maybe we maybe we should finish first uh our talk and then you can add suggestions maybe i i don't want to i don't want to suppress you but n i'll uh finish this uh quick um okay i've had everything i guess on the front yeah the back yeah
we thought about yeah uh the back is of course totally titanium and we thought about the logo big
in the middle just so again the double r  we have then the logo on front and on the back maybe that's too
much but you have to say uh say that if you think that way
and the company slogan we thought in a kind of arc shape uh above the logo that's basically what we were thinking about and

oh and uh before i forget yeah the the voice of course the voice recorder is uh at the bottom and you can record it uh using yeah the the the back of the f w device
why
well it fits uh it it it it fits the hand mean uh the the the the
in the middle in the
that's the question uh well yeah h what do you suggest i mean we do this was mike's prototype and y you seemed to agreed on it but now you have a totally different
the size yeah well the size doesn't really matter w i mean side uh oh the side w we we he drew the s the side but you d you weren't paying attention as usual well any case we'll discuss it now uh i think uh this is a pretty good uh good idea
but you you hold it like this you're not holding it like this or something
you yeah y how do you call it yeah well y y y you don't have it like this you have it more like this you you you're using buttons this way or if you're right handed this way
so you yeah so
yeah well
and maybe you can you can grab it a bit higher so well
well the the well that's a reason to to to put the l c d  screen uh of course on the upper side but
if necessary but uh are d can you live with it uh
y yeah y y y y you said it was totally uh unusable but do you
but d you don't think this is completely unusable i guess i think
not totally well
yeah but of course y you are also human we have to take uh every everyone into account so
yeah well uh who who else thinks like you we don't know maybe a thousand people or a million people
let it be alright so that's that uh any other suggestions
you're very personal again


well d we designed it so of course we are very
yeah
so and we ha we have answer now yeah
i yeah i think it

well l well let's start with the beginning just one by one
well i guess uh i think uh it's uh it's it's um pointed towards the youth of course uh if you look at the design and and the colours and everything that was our target audience of course but it's also not completely um
uh u unacceptable for older people i guess uh it's it's not f a device that
yeah that's that's uh for older people it's it's more that classical look so
uh no i think yeah they like black of course but i think they'll uh they they think uh the the titanium look of it
is also uh i think it's also good for them so i think we both uh have uh consider considered
uh the youth and also a bit older people so i think it's very good looking and not only for
youth uh young people
yeah the fourteen yeah
is it easy to t change channels yeah well i think so
i think it's uh as easy as uh can be made uh
so i yeah you how can you make it any easier
yeah huge is a yeah
d we d we don't we don't have uh that s
yeah
well we don't have the device that beeps uh when you lost it or so but um um
yeah yeah
mm
are we take too much time

yeah very much one

yeah
and i think fancy feeling too because of the titanium back yeah
so well maybe two because of the voice recorder
f
yeah one or two yeah
four
well it doesn't really resemble any fruit uh that's true but but we have the the the the the sparkly fruity colours of course and you can also have front with uh with fruit on it


i knew things uh were going uh too smoothly
there had to be some kind of trouble along the way
my god
the what the
yeah w tha that's uh that's a bit an optional option
no no d th no
yeah
no
n
uh well we have a bit of a problem i think because uh
the l c d  screen yeah
no
because uh that uh y because my information says it
huh
uh well yeah i i read something about it but

yeah i i read something about it but it wasn't very clear i d i didn't in include it in my report
single
well you have to use
a chip so
well you have to use the advanced chip if you have the l c d  screen
but if you have a regular chip you can't have the l c d  screen
that that's a fact uh
yeah but it's only one half uh it d it doesn't
but we d then we have to lose the l c d  screen
yeah i know but that's what my information says i di i didn't uh put uh the advanced chip in there for fun you have to use it


for the l c d  screen yeah yeah
well uh and what do they mean with curves uh again because we you have uncurved
yeah
well
but what what did what do n sorry but what do they mean with the curves is th is this a curve one curve yeah this is actually two curves yeah it's how you it's how you look at it
well then we have a huge problem i think w t we can never get uh below the twelve and a half

but uh i
hey but uh i think you'll agree that uh that we that now we have this uh screen it's it's very uh not practical to ha to consider this after we have designed the entire thing
well that's pretty uh l
n not very practical well
but i'm n i don't agree i think
i think the titanium just uh provided the the tough look and the and the
and also the the older people will like it because of that and because i alright it's not our target audience but it's it's useful if it's uh important for old people yeah
i think the titanium is very important
yeah we have a problem yeah w but you can better yeah dump the l c d  screen then
well what else w i mean uh
yeah
yeah well yeah alright i agree with that so we u we use uh
unfortunately um
titanium coloured plastic
so titanium coloured plastic for the back
yeah this is good but it it's not good enough
so we have to use the ditch the titanium i'm afraid
what do we well what do we know all we want is a is a fancy design but we don't really consider the costs so
yeah al alright yeah but we have to deal with it now so
so
titanium gone and add plastic
and on plastic times two and then we uh are there
no
no yeah well oh six a lot of plastic yeah no two for the to make it clear
i want gold plating no no um
we have we have to uh fill
w we ha no no no but th that's not f um
well you can you can double curve if you don't have titanium and that we dropped so it it can be done but it's pretty funny we we do want to reach
twelve point five but it isn't bad to to to stay at eleven
we get more salary if we make if cheaper than twelve uh twelve and a half
objection
well i can't get no satisfaction but uh i think it's uh well in in if we consider the costs then this is the best yeah
its it's uh ridiculous actually but
which isn't very practical but that's the way uh huh
well uh they they didn't think of the requirements it's the requirements of the user uh i guess
yeah
yeah but they base that on on the user specifications

it was a complete disaster no uh it it it uh it is uh
no it's other way around that's the smartboard that's the digital panel
that's that's the smart
a televi yeah
yeah left or right
well i didn't use uh
nei it it's much m
but uh you can uh i i sent it about three times now uh a green uh board with uh chalk is much more useful than that thing
the simple uh sch school board
i i didn't use it i wrote things down but i didn't import it into my laptop
that's the
w but also y you write things down and i you can also bring your your your note block so what's the what's the th what's the point of importing it into
yeah alright for drawings but not for personal notes i think that's not very
uh i mean you can bring your paperwork along and p well of course if you have a lot of paper if you've if you've

yeah i understand but i think uh d this option is only useful if you've got a lot of paperwork you can't it's not very uh ni yeah well a lot of documents are yeah
mu yeah right
can we keep them uh
well did you really uh
did you really take uh take those in account i half of time i didn't notice they were there so
but we shouldn't talk about that because this is a realistic environment
right okay

but yeah w well th that's just the the environment they set us up f with so

well for drawing for drawings yeah
well
no
but it's still an expensive uh expensive
but if w yeah
well and if
and but what if uh maybe this this board uh smartboard is malfunctioning or someone but suppose it was working correctly what uh would it be useful then if it wasn't off all the time a
really
anything you want any b b yeah l li li
yeah
well it isn't but maybe that thing is uh is
yeah board a school board yeah
yeah i it has it is useful yeah
this uh if it works correct maybe this thing this thing is just malfunctioning so uh if we get in uh if we get another one and you make sure it does work i think then it's pretty useful
because uh yeah you can draw t things quickly and uh clearly for anyone uh in the discussion room and then you can save it immediately
did you type that

maybe till four o'clock or something well dunno yeah
no we must save this thing yeah in the shared map map
map is it a good word the folder yeah
so it is useful yeah no but uh
radical yeah
do you believe it yourself

they also want to see my cat and his rabbit and uh
your big beautiful bird
maybe the pen is just uh uh broken and the board isn't of or the other way around uh
yeah i think so too
who is she you're talking about oh you mean our uh coach our f personal coach
is she also our accountant
is she responsible for sending that information so late oh
because then we have to confront her with our

yeah that that's our new slogan yeah i like that
blame our accountants
but we couldn't yeah
well i th yeah

yeah


okay

mm right
mm hmm
yeah

yeah i agree
it depends on the size if it's kinda small this is is great but if it's it's larger then you want to grab it
yeah that's the question

yeah i agree with the l c d  screen you have it in your palm like this and you can watch uh watch the screen and if you have it li in the middle your hand might be over it
like you're holding your telephone
because if you have a screen on it you wanna look at your screen
yeah i agree on this
no i don't think so that's not uh the point
and you might be uh you might be target customer

yeah
alright great


well this is just a short intro i'm going to do uh the ev evaluation that's gonna be
done at the end of seven point skill criteria so i made a
i made a few questions on the hand of uh uh the impor most important requirements and trends
and we have to look if our uh if our device uh is working correctly well i put some questions in a word file see if i can find them
uh uh uh uh mm
well
i uh think you have all seen uh this kind of evaluation so uh i don't have to explain it uh the first question
is uh is the device good looking because normal p uh most people thought that
um earlier devices were ugly ugly seventy five percent of them so
what do we think
yeah
no i know but i have to uh evaluate it so i have to take this questionnaire
yeah
yeah but i can't can s
yeah but uh you know
we dis we di we designed it to be perfect so but we have to be critic critical
about it and i have to uh take all these points and get a average at the end so we we know where we stand
'cause th there are some things we might have uh bi might have forgotten
right so
right uh is it good looking
the titanium might be uh f
for older people
it you put uh put a black front on it or something
right
right
right a number please
so the last one is seven easy to change channels
oh sorry yeah right
change channels
right

the power channel and volume buttons are easy accessible
two
alright the uh device is easy to find if you lose it
yeah six right
yeah i agree
yeah
alright two

yeah yeah i agree no yeah
right r  r s i  sensitive
r s i  sensitive
four um
yeah
right
yeah that's great
well with the uh three
nah f four i think if you look at this
no
three alright
yeah that's true but
right
the average will uh come later
it has to go to twelve right twelve and a half
out that's easy kick it out yeah
the speaker
that's some wrong info man
no
it's uh
it's just extra kick it out
what more
batteries are uh quite
uh no no no no
hmm
yeah
yeah we need to have the the l c d  screen
no
yeah but no that's n it's not relevant
yeah
no then the whole concept is uh
you
you can make you can make it cheaper but if you don't sell

no no no no

if if you make people brand aware they are willing to pay more but
because we we use a brand at the front and uh i dun at the back if you have uh lots of uh marketing
people might buy
if you if you make it cool to have
oh that's just great
oh alright

that is pretty stupid


y
yeah i agree
i don't think you should dump the l c d  screen
or you shou it's or change the titanium or dump the l c d  screen but i think you could better
change uh titanium to hard a hard kind of plastic looking like titanium than lose the l c d  screen
because you have lots of functions in it too
yeah i agree
osl
if you don't have the money you can't make it so s if you don't have the money you can't make it so this is too expensive
so we have to make it cheaper
right
it's just free man

yeah right i want chrome
well th that that is the problem
yeah shoot

yeah
yeah me too
right
leadership
well it's it was very democratic
yeah yeah
well
yeah think so too
yeah i don't like it yeah

this this this isn't a smartboard right
yeah right b but you this is just a large t large television you u you use the
yeah but you ca this is just a beamer function and here on this one you can uh draw the pictures and things like that but
that one
that one isn't accurate it just doesn't work you can
yeah but i think there's a big distinction between the these th i don't need a smartboard
yeah but give me a beamer that's uh that's much uh much cheaper
right
yeah
i agree
no
yeah
yeah it isn't practical right
your notepad yeah

yeah it might be useful for drawings i i agree on that
yeah right
that stefan use
no i don't think so it's it's only useful if you have to draw something
yeah
yeah great yeah
wireless uh wireless things
well these chairs man really great


communicate in between yeah right yeah
yeah i agree

well more more information in the beginning
that's
for people who uh sketch th the whole day i can imagine that it's useful
well
yeah i agree
mouse is ju just isn't working if you're sketching
yeah but he's saying if it is correct and you can draw very yeah very precise
yeah mu
it saves time

celebration
well


yeah you better get started

huh

oh alright
oh great man
i'm gonna buy one buy one for my bedroom



maybe you are broken
you know
i think she's listening
i feel watched
yeah
do that
yeah
very catching
i'm sure management would like that
oh that's just great
okay hi everybody and welcome to our kick off meeting um for our new product that we're gonna be designing
um i'm mandy and i'm the project manager and i know all your names again courtney
fenella and amber alright okay so first let's
go through this powerpoint
i wonder what button i press
yeah or how about i just click okay here is our agenda for this meeting um we're gonna start with our opening
which was our introductions we're gonna get to know each other a little bit better um tool training
we're going to i guess figure out what to do on this project with our individual roles um we're gonna make a project
plan and then have some time for discussion and close up the meeting
okay here is our project we're gonna make a new remote control that's um original trendy and also user friendly
and how we are going to do it is each of us is going to um we're gonna have
discuss the functional design first how is it gonna be used what's the actual goal here it has to operate
t v  blah blah blah and we're going to do individual work on that and then meet same thing with conceptual
design just the basic overview of the project and then we're going to do
individual work meet that's pretty much the the whole process for today and then the detailed design just
more in depth get the actual schematics of the remote okay
alright first we're gonna start off by using our tools and the whiteboard
thing do you guys wanna give that a try even though the ink wasn't working or do you wanna do it on here
alright let's go forward then um right now so we're all gonna draw our favourite animal and then sum up our favourite characteristics of that animal even if you are not a good drawer like me alright
um
bless you

oh do i

'kay about one more minute
okay
okay and who would like to start us off
alright
only if they're piranhas
alright who wants to go next
no it looks like a cat
i love cats too i'm a cat person
uh
if you're around one i had a roommate who was um allergic but if she was around my cat forever she became used to it you know it's weird
okay
okay fenella
badger good choice why a badger

alright
okay and i'm last 'kay look at my sad sad giraffe no no no
it ends up looking like some kind of a dinosaur but whatever i don't know even much about giraffes but i just
love the way they look they're just such odd creatures you know i i like that they're so unique and individual
i guess i don't know much about their behaviour or anything though only seen a couple in zoos yeah but you can appreciate
the way they look okay alright guess we're getting straight back
into business here um the selling price for our remote is going to be twenty five euro
and our profit aim is fifty million euro we're going to make this an international product
marketed in the states in europe in asia and um our production
cost to make that profit is gonna be a max of twelve fifty euro per remote
okay so we're gonna talk for a little while um here are some topics that we might
be able to discuss expe our experiences with remote controls um our first ideas about this new remote
anything that you can bring to the table for this project so
yeah you wanna start us off anybody have anything to offer
right
tivo
they're never universal that's right esp e especially if you buy a a not big product d v d  player say usually it doesn't work if it's not one of the yeah yeah something from sam's club
yeah
yeah
'kay and um another thing that i think is important is the d the design of the product how
it feels in your hand if it's just flat and kind of boring th those don't
nobody wants to buy those any more they want the ergonomic ones yeah ones that
ones that look high tech too
right so that people like my mother can use it
yeah
'kay anybody have any experiences with remote controls that they can remember that
yeah that's true
do some of them use triple a s though
okay
okay yeah but that has to do with the size of it too well w as long as we know that issue is
here we can
triple a but it's okay we don't have to decide about it now just as long as we remember battery type and size is important hey anything else
alright moving along
oh we're closing the meeting next meeting is gonna start in thirty minutes here's what we're going to do
um the i d  which is who okay you're going to think about
the working design what do you think that means
okay and u i d  the technical fun functions design making sure it does
everything that we need the remote to do the functionality of it operating all those different things okay and
the marketing person that's courtney is going to do the user requirements specification
i guess that means specifying um what exactly the user is going to
be looking for right i would think so okay and you're gonna get more specific instructions emailed to
you in just a little while okay so does anybody have anything they wanna say before we close the meeting
okay this meeting is officially over
yep

i think we should forgo the whiteboard since we can't actually see what we're writing
artistic skills nil

i draw like i'm in grade five
i'll go i drew a kitty it's pretty much impossible to tell that's a cat but i love cats
i love cats because they're independent uh they pretty much know what they want they get it they move on
i'm allergic to cats too
i still can't sleep with them in my room
yay
are you trying to suggest something
well we wanna make a multifunctional remote right one remote for everything
um
i think they'll be phasing v h s  out shortly
okay
so we'll have to figure it how to cover all the different variances in signals
what about something with the curvature like that matches the curvature of a hand
what kinda battery would we want to use because battery changing is usually okay
yeah
can you with a small lithium battery
just do it on the arrow


fine





no i kne i knew
yeah
ah
in my next life
um i drew a badger
well yeah uh
i dunno they're grumpy and nocturnal and
well a little bit like the yes um and then if you know wind in the willows badger yeah and then uh i don't know if you know brian he's liverpudlian writer
um that kind of books badgers are cool in that one too

now

and everything being wait we have what sound system t v  d v d  v h s  uh tivo
but it's still there so
if po if we're gonna do it
or if it's not like a sony if it's like a i don't know
but at the same time are simple

just bad ones
um
d
double a 
some but
yeah i guess then it's
if we need to do triple a  we can but most people usually have double a s around
right

mm hmm
yep
we could
yeah we could on here
oh thanks


i'll go um this is my picture i drew fish i like fish because uh
you know their whole water vascular system thing it's pretty cool and um they've got a pretty good habitat
and they are pretty sometimes sometimes vicious but that's okay yeah
yeah they they're easy you know
yeah
no i i see it yeah it does look like a cat
i'm allergic to cats oh okay
yeah yeah if you're around them for a long period of time
oh yeah this summer i oh i had to live with cats it was crazy yeah
cool

oh okay
no that's good
you don't really have to i mean if you like 'em
right
yeah tivo
it needs to be compatible 'cause universal remote controls are never universal
and what we need an insanely good instruction booklet because you always have to reconfigure all your contraptions to go with the remote anyways
they want like the flashy lights oh like this came from las vegas
mm yeah
double a 
yeah some use triple a s so double or triple
yeah if we want it to be more thin then we'd probably wanna go with a triple a 

right
oops


mm hmm
the rapple also no
okay
mm hmm with the link here in
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
of the value yeah mm hmm mm of the previous r uh page rank or of the
okay
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
uh huh
mm okay

mm uh huh
so wait uh i don't get it you you have two representation one which comes from this link uh stuff and one f this one is not based on p l s a  too yeah
okay
y
a t  yeah uh okay
yeah yeah okay okay
okay
mm hmm
ah uh okay
yeah yeah it's okay
mm mm mm
yeah
or they use the perplexity on the the likelihood to say oh good this likelihood is uh is it's smaller than the other mm
mm hmm

mm hmm


uh it's the same
i it's making the assumption that uh this human categorisation is related to the one that is discovered uh mm
mm
oh yeah
no but
but i have the feeling i in
but in this case you you have to use uh the label one yeah your los
but how does it enter in that i i you have to train your uh
your training data
yeah but the point is that you should change in a way that to take the label into account or not
okay
okay okay
mm hmm
mm mm
no but w

but i
no
the the there is not uh v uh perfect uh clustering clus wh what is the how do you judge uh what is a good clustering
and you're not exactly compar uh you're comparing them
ah okay okay yeah yeah yeah
also like a baseline yeah
you m you still not combi
no no but it's another
mm
mm hmm
mm
mm mm in fact i i have seen a paper in i c m l  where the guy was trying to
learn which word he um aspects of clustering so i give you
i give the real users mm the person um a bunch of marbles and they begin to say
okay and they have to divide it in five group and in the end it's not al it's it's always different to the
clustering each people has because it's completely subjective but in but there is uh some characteristic
that are for transparency colour which are um features that made the clustering
that can be extracted even if the clustering it's always different
so so that's only to say that uh it's it can be really infinitive clustering
mm hmm
say another another example apart from uh this uh search uh i don't get it exactly what you mean then don't don't use a google page because it's uh too uh s root but uh another page mm
mm
mm hmm
oh it's not that
people being your algorithm that's the point mm it's getting


mm hmm exactly
we're not trying to to fit yeah
mm
you had onl two topics or no yeah
yeah yeah yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
it was linki mm hmm mm hmm
so it was a a good point for you mm mm hmm mm
like this yeah mm mm mm okay
mm hmm mm
mm mm
mm mm probably not yeah
mm mm
mm mm
mm
yeah mm and
mm hmm
yeah
um this alpha i can it be dependent of the of the document and how many text is in it or something uh yeah
mm
mm hmm so mm


mm hmm
mm hmm

oh of course yeah mm
mm
yeah yeah w w i think we've agree on that yeah mm mm
mm
mm probably heuristic it will be easier to compute because
mm hmm mm hmm yeah mm
mm
mm
did you manage to to divide the link uh properly or
okay
mm hmm

l d a 
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm pyramid yeah
ah okay
yeah
mm mm
'kay
mm mm
in two months yeah

you never know whether you've got these things on right or not you never know whether they're on right or not
feels wrong
okay so i don't need that
okay so david came in to me and to say uh i something we'd been
talking about for a while was some stuff i'd been working on about using these topic models with uh with
networks with n things with links between them documents that are linked
uh n uh it's actually it's related to rapple but it's not actually that th this
is something i haven't actually been working on for a couple of months now uh just because i came up with something more interesting
that i've been working on but uh th at the time basically i'd been trying to use p l s a  and those
types of models on web pages and that came up with uh a big problem in that
most web pages have very very little text on them
but you can tell what they're about based on the other texts on the site the texts on the things they're linked to
so what i wanted to know was can you combine the topic models that the pages that have lots of text on them with
something else that that tells you what a page that has no or very little text on it based on
the links yeah so quite simply if you have a page one
which is like a home page and that'll maybe have five links and a picture on it and then because it links to
page two and page three
can you tell what this is about
yeah so i started looking at uh google page rank which kinda does this by
saying well the links go the other way it says if this page is about fish or in google
they say if this page is good in some way and it links to this other page and we don't know what this is
then that page is more likely to be good and it's just page rank is just a simple algorithm for doing this over the whole big network
so i wanted to combine the topic models that tell you beforehand what you think this page and this
page are about with this to maybe get a better idea so the idea is
say you've got some text on a page that's only part of the picture about what of what the page is really about and
the links pointing to that page are also part of the picture so i basically came up
with an algorithm that's just a i it plugs p l s a  uh plugs page rank into p l s a 
right so page rank you basically just d uh say
you basically take the how good this page is which is x  and how good this page is which is y 
and you then say this page is based on uh how do you do this
based on the the links coming into it uh it's just a like a sum
over all the the links of uh well x  link i guess
o of of the value uh uh the but it's not it's
yeah if if so if this is page rank of x  page rank of y 
i think this is roughly it off hand page rank of z  so you say page rank of
z  is equal to uh one over a constant to normalise it
uh sum over all the links into z  of page rank
of the link yeah tha it's like that yeah so similar idea
if you got a vector that says what the topics are say you've learned from p l s a  a d a distribution of topics for every page
so if you say a probability of topic one for
uh for page uh z 
uh is equal to and you can use the same sort of thing right so nicking a whole bunch of
maths from how you work out page rank uh it comes up with uh just uh an iterative algorithm which is just
uh the current probability of topic one given z 
so that's probability old plus uh
i yeah plus that and then you normalise between them so you say alpha and one minus alpha yeah so w basically what you're saying here one minus alpha say link contribution you can call this i guess
so what you're saying is that a page is partly from its text that you've got on the page and it's partly from what the links say it's about so that alpha thing is how much do you trust the text on the page and how much do you trust the links so that alpha could be different for every page
so what i did then was try this on a big database of web pages uh
and i had some results from that but they were all on temp two so that's not important right now uh but as it is not really important
i can regenerate that the problem was that this gives you a new vector
of topics for every page so you've got two vectors you've got the one that you've just got from p l s a  or whatever model
and you've got the one that you get from this
uh how do you tell which one's better i had no way to evaluate this well how do you tell that this page because you don't know where the topics are 'cause they're learned automatically uh so
it it is yeah because uh b yeah you initialise it with uh actually
thi this is kinda wrong this is not old but start this is how you this is how you you
start it off so this this is what p l s a  gives you to start with and then you iterate this and it becomes something else
yeah
mm hmm that's it exactly yeah
exactly yeah so you've now got you've got p l s a  gives you two probabilities right so it gives you a probability
of a topic given a document which is z  given d  and a probability of
a word given a topic so this is the same for both models
yeah well yeah what you do is you're taking this and iterating over it the probability of the
topic given the document uh so have i made that clear i'm i'm not sure if i'm explaining this well okay
right so y i you m
yeah so we were struggling at how do you evaluate this because uh i mean if you look at the way that p l s a 
and all those kind of models have been evaluated it's th they never quantitative quantitatively do anything they always say
uh well look at the clustering there's here we've got some documents that all appear to be about the same thing and
here's where we get some other documents that all appear to be about the same thing and you can't really tell exactly how good that is you can just get an idea that it's
yeah so tha that's the first thing th that thing when i spoke to you about this you suggested d use the likelihood and pedro came up with a really good example why that could be bad so you have uh
you have the uh oh let me thing of what this was it was to do with cars basically if you have you have a topic that's uh representing
cars and you can tell that that's representing cars by looking at this distribution and it's the same for both now you wanna tell which
i i this page uh pedro's example of what it was is that is says on the page lotus
elise okay and that uh no f
i can't i just remember it was a really can you ig remember what it was
no okay
yeah i didn't really consider doing it on perplexity actually that to be hon but okay
okay
is that fair though because i think one of the things with these topic models is that you don't know you can't make them cluster
okay
hmm
yeah
okay and that is is that really fair though can you say that if a set of documents
if the clustering of these documents is closer to the effecti what you what you've got there is uh
a clustering of documents a as your devaluation yeah uh thi this these labels the yahoo categories
that's that's a clustering so you're by saying that this clustering is closer to that clustering is
is does that necessarily mean that it's better
mm hmm
okay
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm kay
mm
we uh i think your point was that you you train this without labelling first yeah
mm
mm hmm
well th yeah the the thing that worries me about this approach is that say the really really really simple example of this
where your directory had two categories in it uh good and bad and and and you run p l s a  on it now that doesn't
do it good and bad it does i dunno english and french pages so they don't match but the clustering is still very
good in in one respect uh but but you you can extend that up even if you have a hundred categories p l s a 
can find a hundred clusters that are a good clustering but are completely unrelated to the directory
hmm
but but what i wanna know i is that which of them has the better representation of a given page
so so given a random page uh and these two models uh and the wo the words that these two models
give which is more likely to
mm hmm
mm
mm hmm
mm hmm
okay
yeah
okay
s okay i'm i'm just n concerned that that's uh that that's it's answering a question that evaluates in some way but maybe not in the way that
well that maybe not is the same way i was thinking but maybe it's a better way um so what i mean by that is that sorry i'm trying to process all this uh
yeah i it's the same thing like it it does tell you whether this uh which clustering is better for this task but it doesn't tell you which clustering better represents the pages necessarily but it it's it you you could say that it possibly doe it probably does
okay
mm
yeah i

mm
okay
mm
i think mm uh no i th i'm i'm coming round to it actually
no i'm so i i i think i g uh i i get it uh i i th i think it probably is fair i'm just i i've gotten um uncomfortable with it but i think that'll go if i think about it enough
uh but but yeah the it it but it just seems a little suspect but i think that's just from the whole
point that you can't tell which clustering is b better but uh what i'd thought before was could you get people to evaluate
this by by hand basically could you give people a set of pages and like say you did it with five topics for
example uh now you give people five sheets uh you give uh a t a a user
five sheets of paper each with
words in varying sizes representing the probability of that topic for example try give the user these pieces of paper to get an
idea of what these topics are that's this p  of w  given z  and then you give them some pages and say
which one would you which piece of paper would you put that with and then you get
like an intuitive ide uh like how would a person cluster pages given the what these topics
supposedly are 'cause i you've got something that's fixed the the p  of w  given z  with respect to both models so i
was tr i was hoping you could use that to
mm
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah okay
hmm
okay
see the the thing about web pages i thought as well in that getting humans to evaluate it in some way is that you have
most of the web pages that are uh well a lot of the web pages that are important in some
way are are are home pages so google dot com doesn't actually say the words search on it i think
i maybe it says go but you only know it's about search through the thing but someone looking at it can tell that it's a
search engine because of the way it's laid out because of the pictures on it and because of all of that there's a lot of information
that's completely lost in this bag of words representation and i was hoping that in some way you could use that to evaluate
this i have no idea how but uh yeah
mm
yeah
mm
yeah
okay i think i know it but it yeah thi this is effectively what we have here though and th that directory is one clustering of
the marbles and you're hoping that it it so what you're saying is that i have two clusterings of marbles for my two
models and i have a test clustering of marbles it's saying that one of these is more close to the test
t t to the the one that we've been given is that it's saying that what does that actually say that doesn't uh it says it's
g better for this task but it doesn't really say anything else
mm hmm
okay
okay
okay uh and so and so if i get that right what what the algorithms are still coming up with is in this way you're looking at a clustering of marbles yeah if each of the algorithms comes up with a defin
ah okay right that makes sense
okay
okay
okay i'm convinced i'm convinced alright so it's good right uh alright well thanks um
i'm trying to think of anything i haven't said about the stuff but that uh from looking at the results i got it looked quite good um
just like hand reading them in that one of the things i did was i started a i a web crawl at the idiap homepage
it did not very many pages only like two thousand or something like that but enough to get the pages that were close to idiap
to have a lot of links between them so that there was enough to be able to run this link clustering algorithm
so what you find is that the pages around idiap there's a lot of english pa speaking pages and a lot of french speaking pages
so of course this uh p l s a  completely separated those out into into categories
uh so when i looked at the the word likelihoods there were two topics one was very clearly english words that most likely word was the and one was very clearly french words most likely words was de i think and uh
no i had many topics the others looked like garbage couldn't tell what they might have been but anyway uh tha that's often the case when you look at it you can tell very clearly that one or two topics are a b not the rest yeah
it is
ok
hmm that w uh anyway that when i run it on that uh what i found was looking through some of the sites uh i looked
for the sites that the models differed on that where one said it was probably an english phrase and the other said it was probably a french phrase
and i found a good few examples where you had a site that looked uh well one that i remember off
hand was it was a page and it was a big picture and links down the site but the links were all pictures
so you couldn't the the words were in french and the links but there were no words picked up by the when i did the crawl for the model
and there was a small bit down here and in this there was uh meant to be picture in there but it didn't load uh or uh b
it was meant to be something else and it said uh in english it said four o  four this page cannot be found
so all the words on this page were english but it was very very clearly a french page so the first model said it was an english page
'cause all the words were in english second model said very definitely a french page because all of these pointed to french sites and it was only pointed to
it was something dot f r  as well it's
yeah so i i found a couple of examples that were kinda like that mm but the the problem
that i found when i ran it uh the th the thing that was a bad point was that if you have uh
say tryin i was trying to say if you could evaluate this with search given some keywords like
which model would more likely find you a p good document that that sort of approach uh
what i found was that say you had
uh
uh th tha that's not too relevant necessarily but if you have say a topic distribution for uh
one page and it very very highly scores on the p l s a  for one of the the topics and that's right okay
this model because it's averaging out over all the pages nearby all of the topic distributions become more flat
it it becomes more uncertain about everything
so i don't know if that's necessarily a good thing or not yeah in in some cases it's gonna be a bad thing b
because ev every page is linked by the way the algorithm works every page is linked eventually to everything else
so it every page has information incorporated in it or i the distribution learned for every
page has information incorporated in it from every other page's distribution as well so it averages out it flattens
all the distributions depending on what this alpha is
mm hmm
well i i think that the thing is
yeah that that there's a balance in the uh for example take a page like uh slashdot and it's like a news
site uh for geeks and you have uh nerds yeah news for
nerds stuff that matters uh all of the like hundreds of thousands of pages point to that but they're about completely
different things so you in effect are losing information about what that page is about because there's so many things pointing to it
and they all average out as
yeah so that
th that's my first idea w was how i set this i remember for the lotus thing wasn't there um so
i thought you wanna probably set this alpha per page there's probably some heuristics for example this page there's no text in it will set
it very low in user information for the links problem is this is what pedro immediately said what if you have a page that looks like this
it's got a big picture of a car uh
anyway and it says lotus elise so you know that it's definitely about car but it's only got two words so you can't
just do it by words because those two words completely specify into something or other uh su you suggested doing likelihood
but at that time and i can't remember what my problem was with that it might not have been a good
thing but you've got two likelihoods for it as well no maybe not
mm
yeah maybe do it by cross validation something
okay there's
mm
hmm
yeah that that is fair
yeah okay
it yeah d
no
yeah i so uh i i think that that's too easy you can do it with some heuristics and you can learn it from the task results in or combine the two so tha that's kinda straightforward i think
yeah the the the thing about doing it through cross validation or something like that with the task is uh the problem with
doing a page rank style algorithm is that is that it gets better it it converges better and it gives you better results
the closer a network is to being a small world network so small world network mean basically
some far links but generally very clustered locally uh now the thing about doing a web
crawl is the bigger your web crawl the closer it'll be to the overall structure of the net n the internet which is a small world network the smaller
your web crawl the less small world network like it's gonna be
so the more pages you get the better your results and people running this style of algorithm the page rank style stuff generally run it on
about two million or twenty million pages or whatever the the stanford web base data set that
i was using for this for for a bit of this um they have a a d
i can't remember off hand but they have m maybe a bit over a theta byte worth of web pages in this a bunch of servers
uh
yeah maybe wikipedia is a good thing to do
was i was concerned about wikipedia though was that it's while it has a high level of inside links that has a lot of directory style links as well that might mess up it actually being a see wh while you have
ah okay that's good
that plus i guess it's actually straightforward to say to start with is this a small world network and then run it on that
you were running that on what we what was it like half a million pages something like that is it and that was for half of it uh if i remember
okay
okay the whole thing was
mm
mm hmm
okay i mean i think off hand thinking about this model it would have to work better because two things in the same category are going to be linked so it it yeah
okay yeah that's i think tha it's gonna be more true in some networks and in some tasks than others and i think in the wikipedia it's probably gonna be it's a good one to test on
mm hmm
okay
okay
hmm

mm hmm
okay yeah it i'll maybe i'll have a look at the wikipedia stuff anyway i'm stuck doing something else for the next month
or two anyway so uh this is always the case uh the there's another thing um uh this was
new but i haven't thought about this too much but it's on the same lines in that uh have have you guys seen this uh
correlated topic models work correlated topic models it's david blei the guy that came up with uh
with l d a  he's got uh a new model that's it's published in nips this year but his co author put it on their web site a
month or two ago so uh you know l d a  d you all know l d a  or yeah
uh okay so a l d a  you basically draw a a dirichlet which says like what type of document this is effectively and then
you draw a topic given that dirichlet distribution and then you draw words given that
alright well that's for for every word and that's once for the document and that's you've got a parameter coming at this globally so that that's roughly what the model is plus other little bits
but anyway so what they did was they they reworked this because one of the problems with l d a  and i think p l s a 
has this problem as well in is that uh the more topics you have the less
uh expressive it can be because the topics it cluster it it pushes a document
if it is pulling a document into one topic it pushes another topic away from that doesn't that make sense so the topics are necessarily
trying to be different from each other
so the more topics you have the more th they're sort of squeezing into the space of what things can be about uh
and things are kinda pushed out so once you m go over you try it one corpus and once you go over about a hundred maybe two hundred topics
uh the the new you add more topics and it doesn't get better in any way the model doesn't
the n new topics are effectively going to just be garbage
uh alright so what they did was they they they stopped using the dirichlet and uh
they're starting to use uh a gaussian there so it it in
to spare the details basically they've they've got a variable here i think they call it eta uh and
they from this generate a distribution of topics in some way but it's generated from a
gaussian space from a from a a space so it's given a a mean and covariance uh and
yeah uh so what it does the this is the the bit that took me forever to understand actually uh same
model but this is given a gaussian space it maps that down into the simplex
of what a topic can be about the so the simplex basically if you've got a say you've got
two topics now say i i say you get three topics that makes more easier to draw
uh for this is theta one theta two theta three these are the probabilities that that
a document is about uh this theta one is the probability that this document is about topic
one theta two is so these guys all have to add up to one yeah
uh so that basically means that what a document is about lies on this space between them yeah
so this is the simplex uh so basically a distribution generated by this guy is basically a point
on this simplex
so what they do is they've got a distribution that maps uh a gaussian and some space into a distribution
on this thing so it maps it into gaussian in that the cool thing about that is that if you've got two gaussians
you can tell how close they are so you can now tell how close two topic distributions are right so
you can have as many as you like uh and you can tell that they're close to each other so there's load of ideas that i had about this
uh in that if you can tell that two topic distributions are close to each other
so for example if you split a document into two parts and said that the two parts have to be close in the distribution you can see how the doc t the document changes for exa stu stuff based on that
with this idea what if rather than working with this p  of z  given
d  thing that you had from p l s a  but what if you worked from these gaussians that you get for every document and you said
that in some some function that said uh that the gaussian representing this should be similar
to the ones linking to it now i haven't thought about any of the maths for this but but it should
be uh straightforward i guess to to formulate a basic in terms of the mean should be similar and the covariance maybe should be similar as
well
so it might actually be a better model again i dunno i'll send you guys the link for that correlated topic model stuff if you want but uh i don't know if it's too interesting to you
okay alright well than thanks for hearing me out and the idea especially maybe i can do more with this alright
yeah
yeah b
bastien you can't release this data for four months
yeah
okay
okay
okay

yeah
it is the initialisation of
yeah but then it is iterative
okay so you you should first train the p l s a  stuff then you initialise this
link uh spreading thing and then you iterate over okay and it converge and
so you have the boost uh initial p l s a  and p l s a  plus the link
thing then
yeah
mm
yeah
so th yeah you you you were saying that you would like to evaluate that now yeah right

hmm
but but maybe you you could have some some other labelli li
or the task like if if you imagine you have some labelling on of of the web pages like
like like for example you you look at at at at at a set of pages and you have the
m the directory entries of these pages so
so f like yahoo or entries so you have categories and and entries so for example you have
i dunno cars s u v  etcetera so what you would like would be that
two pages on in the same um category should be
closer than than two pages being spread across different categories
but you you would not use this you will not use the yahoo directory or
n the directory in the training step of i of the model okay this is something you have
just for evaluation and then for example you you your task would be to say
i have some page and and i know where it is in the
in the in the directory and i have another page i don't know where it is and i would
like to to know uh whether it is in the same category as the first one just
by comparing their uh aspects
if they have the same uh yeah so basically what you would like to check if is is
is there some similarity in the in the in the aspect distribution tells me uh something about
uh the sim the the fact that they could be on the same category in the the
this end end label categories
yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah
no no no no no
how would
so so so w what what you would have have basically would be to have a directory which
give you labels for some part of the documents okay so this is a directory and this is some
some some some web page okay so the labelled one okay and you have some page which
are unlabelled but you have links between those two so what what you
would do is that you would try and p l s a  and and uh and use a model over that
then then you would like to for example what f what could be very simple would be just to
then to match each pages like that so let's say you have you have a a page which is labelled
and you say okay the the label page two should get should be the one w which it is
the most similar to or any kind of classification rules you can imagine and so
and so you say okay what what's if i from from this page which have the similar so
so the the criterion would be to compare those two distribution okay
and then and then you would like to assign to this document too where you don't know
the labels the same one as this one
and and here that you use only for test so this is your
then you can evaluate how wrong you are or cu how close you are from the real assignment the right
directory category in this way i think it's fair if you kn if you know only
if you know only that and that and what you would like to discover
is this
this is a r like a real task like like if if if this directory uh uh company would like to extend this directory to new pages without the hassle of having human labelling
yeah you have t you use this one you you only have the labels for some uh small part of the
so
so you you would train it you this is this is t t all all those links are known the links between some labelled document and unlabelled document
i d i think you can do it as a two step process first you you train uh well maybe s it wou could
be better if if if you take it into account but but maybe you can you can
do just a two step process first one you have this uh unsupervised task over both p l  and p u 
and then you from these unsupervised starts you can know which document of p l  is close from the document
of p u  or the reverse and you can infer some label to a document of
p l 
yeah yeah yeah
yeah but
yeah
yeah but but here you can you you say given a random page of p u  which of those two model
is more likely to to to to to say for example that thi the
page of p l  which is the most similar so you so so from this so you take any
distribution comparison things so so hoffmann in his paper was doing just cosine similarity but you can do anything
so so you just compare uh those two distributions so of
d  one and d  two okay and so with that
you can you can determine for example for a document o of the set two to the most
similar
so you you you you select d  one so in this set which is the most similar to d  two according to the distribution from one or the other model
and then and then for this document you automatically assign to it the label of the document uh one
and you check with this which is your uh your your if you are right or not
this is what what this is very related to what frank did with the with the keyword uh
image annotation so you would have a set of keywords the set of image label with keywords and
he has a set of unlabelled image with some and it would check whether the the
label he assigns so in this case annotation word h are correct and i think it's fair uh
it's fair uh setup
so maybe this classification rule is not the best there there's some might be some work to do but the general idea i think it's it's fair evaluations it's a task
that can be dep
yeah
yeah
no but according to this directory yeah
yeah i i i think it's w
yeah
yeah
yeah what's good with the directory is that you have a good coverage of various topic humans humans can
label but then if you want to detect different languages this is another task i think the task of this latent
model is to discover some some semantic like some topic proximity between documents and here
this la this directory is doing the same thing like associating some topics with some documents manually
so comparing them is is is is good setup with respect to the goal
i compare those two like the p l s a  and the one over this same task of assigning good directory i don't know if
if it if it will provide good result result or not but it is clearly a
benchmark for those two goals
on on the infra yeah yeah
yeah
like bag o yeah
yeah you can have tree setups uh yeah
yeah basic cosine over the p  of t  given d  so over all this uh empirical distribution and the two uh aspect uh models
we have to repeat over and over this is like advertisement no no it's joke
no it's jus
yeah yeah this is really yeah yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah but the point is that the z  the the the aspect like the z  are
are are come unsupervisely it's it's more like if you were giving the people you you said to
them okay uh divide me this bunch of documents into five topics and you don't give them the topics
a priori you know so the two person could come up with very different one is very
interesting i in

yeah right
yeah
so i i think i think it's yeah
yeah
yeah
but eve ev even someone would would provide very different labels like like someone would say it's
a page in english someone would say it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a web page
uh wh which has very few uh information in it or anything
so i think there's no hard clustering and what's good with those model is that they they can
they they are intended to provide you some some kind of way to compare two documents rather than
to give you pre defined sets of documents this is not hard clustering the o
i i don't think one one one aspect or one latent topic has any sense by his own
it's when you have the word set and the word distribution that you c you can tell something if you just
take one of them alone so you take all the p  of z  given d  and all of the p  of w 
given giv given z  you you you can do anything with that it's it's the whole
set
i would say an an and this is oh it it should be evaluated meaning that like for example uh the
the example about marbles is that the point what you can learn from all these sets made by people
is that is that those two those two marble would be consider as more likely to be in the same
sets because they they share some common properties which are not seen as the same
for every one but they share some common properties that people will notice
and if you look at the two the d all possible pairs of marble you would have some mu much more agreement between people than than if you look at the predefined sets people would would just cut at some precise uh point
you know what's
yeah
yeah
well you don't you don't really have two clustering no no no no you don't you don't really have two clustering no
no no no you don't have two clustering of of of marbles what you have is y is you have is you have one
clustering of marble which is this one and then you have lots of people telling you i consider those marbles
as very uh have to have very salient feature that they share in common i i c i would like them to be
in the same cluster and you c and and and those two so and one of them is labelled
and the other is not labelled so you look at that you say oh someone told this one was very similar and this one is said to be blue
for example i dunno if it's the label so i put it in the blue bag
but but you don't you never use the blue bag you don't ask the people to look at the blue bag you just look at the people you you just have the people to compare those two marbles and then it happens that some of them have been clustered
and and
yeah yeah yeah this is i reverse both role the this is the players
i i no no no no no it comes up with not with the clustering but with some
way to compare two marbles okay some would say would say i consider those two ones
are completely dissimilar and the other ones say they are very similar and if you find that in your unl
unlabelled clustering those two uh balls uh marbles happen to be in the same uh cluster
you said the user algorithm might be wrong but you average that over lots of documents

yeah
yeah
yeah yeah they make sense only so global optimisation the likelihood is optimisable globally over
the whole aspects etcetera so it's it's you never ask the model to do hard clustering of documents you just
uh ask uh it to find a distribution over aspects such that a document uh
is more likely according to the restriction that the number aspe aspect is limited and and so
it the it just makes sense on the uh looking at the whole set so y i think all
evaluation should take that into account and look at the whole aspect set like here you look at the aspect set
because you look at the similarity of two distribution an any st any kind of thing you where you un
unfold the model and look at it manually looks weird like like in those hoffmann
papers where show you columns with words or things
okay
okay
okay
yeah
yeah
yeah yeah but also it depends on that could be a good effect because if you
if you can be if you can if you are uh highly reliable about one page
but all the page linking to it are actually about very different topics so you could say maybe i was wrong
from deciding only due to the text that this page was about this aspect distribution
because because all the other pages are voting in different direction
while there's a balance

hmm
yeah
pedro's always speaks about cars
but i think for any kind of way you have to select those alpha you you have to look at the effect on on the re
on the t evaluation task and then maybe you can find some patterns that are
then then once you have the once you have the task you could look at at which pages are completely missed by one model
which others are are successful with one model and and you can maybe infer some some rules afterwards
but if you have no task you can uh blindly select s good alphas
like like if if you look at uh if you look at your task and you see that i dunno uh the the
long pages for example have good p l s a  model without fusing links so
then you can infer some heuristics like okay the alpha should be proportional to the lengths or anything like that or to the number
of image in the pages or anything but you should have some some task where you can
individually look at the performance on every on every page and and
and and at as a second step you could infer some kind of rule about how to select alphas with respect
to the task
maybe it's v it's very simple rules but select them blindly s might be odd
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
but but but still li like the the the work i did on on hyperlinks like i used uh wikipedia i i think it's g because it has fairly high level of inside links between
yeah well you can categorise them because they are th it's there's a structure on the on the
web page so you you can select only the links which are within the article or within the categories or
it's it's it's well structured it's it's uh easy to manipulate and
yeah you can even isolate the directory from the categories of wikipedia
well yeah actually i i i divided in three equal size parts which have one hundred fifty documents there are a thousand documents and well but
well what i did with the link well but this is not th exactly the same setup you would have so
in this setup the whole link structure could be known and the only thing you wou don't you w don't know would be the assignation to
uh to a category in my setup it was different because i i sh i couldn't use
the links between different sets but this is not i don't want to mess you up with that it's
not the same kind of experiment but you could just use the whole corpus like this and and for some of them
you assume you don't know the the category assignment and then you can run this set of
experiments over wikipedia
yeah but this is the yeah this is the hypothesis between this uh in this p l s a  with link stuff
oh yeah i thi
yeah but you can you can think also at at other uh task like that like for example you can take proceedings
and assume the categories are the keywords of the of the d of the documents and then if you have
the archive of a journal you can you can use the l the links between uh the citation links
so if you want to have a bigger stuff so wikipedia would be kind of very small with lots of engli
in links and then if you take a journal you will have less links and and more documents
and then you would be likely to say that p l s a  might be better over that because you don't have enough links
so you you you can find examples which are not the web i think it's good to work in closed
set wikipedia is kind of closed set ma even if there's lots of outside links but there's lots of inside links
you have to think at at at at at at at database where there's lot of in links wikipedia might be
one citation for example if if you take the nips arch archive which is available nips author
always other nips author which are often themselves etcetera well it's reported i i won't
say so but but but but yeah i think th th this kind of setup maybe
web pages it's hard to find sets of web pages which have good links stuff if you start from one
page or something
okay
but it's discrete uh no the

okay
yeah
yeah
'kay yeah thanks
okay yeah
well there are lots of good ideas that are recorded and someone will
yeah because the data like will be released very soon
so is it correct or no
hmm
yeah well so we hope
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah
mm hmm
oh this is is frozen frozen okay mm hmm
yeah
perplexity uh
yeah
oh no re no i don't even remember the the you said i would tell you that evaluation should be done based on likelihood or perplexity
well it's bu yeah it's basically the same but
i dunno
yeah another task or
yeah
mm hmm
yeah
no no no i no no no no it's doesn't have to be that if if you use the latent representations
or distribution over aspects you could use this to save two documents uh in the same directory or not
and this you should be able to evaluate then um
yeah
clearly wha we we had done these you can train after that uh an s v m  saying this is category one or two on the label document and then we will have an unlabelled document and you just say this is directory one or two
and if it should improve it if you say this feature extraction process is better than you can have a better cleaner separation between those two
yeah well but
yeah well but i mean if you have to judge it's with respect to a given task i mean you can't say of course it's always good because it's maximising the likelihood of whatever
yeah
mm

yeah it's the same
mm hmm
fus
mm hmm
yeah 'cause i don't think there is any way to say generally this this is better or worse
yeah
it has to be re it has to be really to with respect to this this clustering makes sense or i dunno
yeah you can e even keep the bag of words and do the cosine comparison or
just showing just showing how just first how better this is with respect to bag of words and hopefully then how
you new uh regularised p l z  given d  is i dunno just
uh yeah it's basic
mm hmm
but
yeah
yeah
yeah just know where
yeah

mm hmm
yeah yeah
no it does
yeah it doesn't have to match
yeah but yeah it just re
mm hmm
yeah
because the the latent aspects really doesn't have to match the final uh directory category it can be anything but it's just a way of saying yeah those documen documents are similar in some sense so
is it just it just sometime dangerous to say th these latent aspects means this yeah i think yeah good good good
mm hmm
yeah and the others usually don't mean anything yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
okay
for your model mm good
nerd nerd
mm
yeah cars and web
mm hmm
mm hmm

which ones uh
no no
hmm
okay

well in in three months
oh yeah it's too late three months we should wait
um almost there's one more thing i have to get out of the i have to make sure that this attachment will open
ah ha
okay
we'll open that when the time is right
in the meantime
closing things down okay
let's see what this thing does
does it come up together or disappear one of them or what ah we came up together we're good
okay
are we ready to start
okay it's now quarter of four this is a f another forty minute one so it will end at four twenty five
okay
right our agenda is as before for me to open the meeting for us to go over the previous minutes
then for the two of you to present your prototype and for you to g um sarah present
the evaluation criteria we then have a finance aspect which is a spreadsheet
an excel spreadsheet and i know what you're all thinking of oh my um
because we're only given a forty minute time period to get it all in including the production evaluation
so we're going to make a very fast track okay
um and as you can see that's what we do next on this thing so the first thing i have to do is close this so that i can get to
where is it

i need to open mine
not the agenda
no that th i want the minutes from the previous minutes that should be there minutes
yeah okay uh from meeting three is it alright with you if
i don't switch it to show just use it as is 'cause this way i can
more easily flip it okay um obviously all of us were
here for the last meeting we reviewed the previous minutes before that um each of you
made your presentations
um we discussed the various possibilities based on what was presented in those presentations
the market trend of fruit and veg mm spongy uh fancy
and elegant more than technologically innovative and that more than easy um we
decided chip on print would be used um we would use plastic
with a rubber casing i think was the consensus powered by kinetic energy
there was no decision made on the curvatures or double curvature or straight um perhaps
the prototype will give us an inkling of that um looking like a scroll
but it's really a push button technology excuse my spelling
um that was actually in use that is uh behind the scenes is push button
which we uh according to kate have a very good uh grasp on doing that in production
um we decided that separate fashionable covers covering your fruit and veg might be a
separate product that could be suggested to management um and as suggested
um yellow with black buttons with the company logo a slogan and image might be a good idea
based on the requirements that have been provided to us
um we did have a few production issues and coordination
of the various bits and we had some conflict of ideas and cost constraints
and we ran out of time um we had to follow that up and prepare for the last
one and uh we closed as it ran out of time is that a fair
presentation of what happened okay back to this
meeting um we're down to the prototype presentation
over to you
ooh two
ah
uh huh
'kay
okay
okay
mm hmm
mm hmm


oh i see the on off's in the back
and then you can use your thumb
i could see this thing unless it's reinforced having a problem with the
you know yeah
hmm
okay the next item is evaluation
uh if that's if you're finished
oh sorry

try again
hmm
well we will soon unfortunately
come on
no
elegant
elegant

mm
yeah
the chunk
i think between the two somewhere between the two is true
it's more true than false about a two
mm hmm
trendy
mm hmm
hmm
excess buttons no
better more intuitive buttons yes
no
i like it
mm hmm
yes the instinct says true
yeah that's not a cheap thing to get
hmm
i think we're good
okay we're a little over halfway through the meeting and the next big thing is the finance
okay
yep
right
right
and as you can see it says the same thing it had not lost itself
thank goodness and we're going to raise what's called a sp a spreadsheet
that they provided to me um
and
it says fill in the number of components you plan to use in your device
hand dynamo battery kinetic solar cells
okay
yeah
um
what's a hand dynamo
oh shoot forget that kinetic is um and how many of those will we need per we only need one
okay electronic simple chip on print and we'll need one of those
okay and we only need one of those okay the case will be uncurved and flat or a single curve or a double curve it looks like it single curve 'cause of th the chunkiness it's that's uh uh one
and that's
uh that's the the one that goes like this
right
no single curve
okay case material supplements plastic wood rubber titanium special colour we had the special colour
and did we say plastic
yeah
okay we'll come back if we can to the rubber being added at the moment that's where we are interface button push button interface that's what we're using isn't it
whoops don't want that not yet um
no it just says push button interface button supplements they'll be in a special colour of black
and the buttons
wha what is the buttons made of rubber
so we need one of them
and are they any special form
'cause the rate we're going we can put the rubber on top
oh
okay
um
let's put that rubber in then of the case material supplement
uh we only need one of them
um and the total cost has been calculated as nine pounds twenty out of the twelve and a half we were allowed
we're in that's us
okay i'm going to save this into our
desktop project documents okay
as our project document bit
yeah
there we are
that's the only excel document that will be in there so it's there for all of us
okay so are they under twelve fifty yes go to the project evaluation next
slide right um the project process satisfaction
with for example the room for creativity
yeah leadership
teamwork
means of having whiteboard the digital pens and all that kind of good things
uh huh

okay
so we went over all those things and we're satisfied with all the above
um did we find any new ideas
so we actually worked well as a group
right are the costs within the budget yes is the project evaluated yes
uh huh
mm hmm
alright and we've therefore we have to do the final questionnaire and do the meeting summary i have a final report to present um and then we're done
we done good and we're finished in time

i believe that is the end of our meeting thank you melissa

i keep forgetting whether i've done this
yep
ta da right

mm hmm
um well i don't have very much to add um the the case oops that's the uh on off button just come off
our prototype the the case can be either um spongy rubber or hard plastic
we're not absolutely sure about a combination of the two but it can be either of those we have the technology to do that um
and as for the the actual components um uh steph just said this is
a quite a cheap device to manufacture we have simple rubber push buttons um which provide all the functionality
we need um the um the diode that actually does the um
infrared is at the end it's the stalk of the banana or it's just the thing at the end of this
version um so that's for material colour well uh
steph's the expert on colour um we we don't have any particular restrictions on that
yeah i think that's all we've got to say really
a banana
would you care to examine the prototypes see how they feel in the hand
yes that's so that your index finger automatically goes straight to it
and it was partly we thought the design looked better but it could be moved if if marketing feel it's important to have the on off button in a different place
hmm

and it's a very simple design there's not a lot to wrong the components are cheap to make
mm hmm

yes a plain simple clean design
well we have got s trendy further down but
elegant i don't know if i'd call them elegant
stylish yeah
yeah i'd
i d i don't think that's what we're aiming at with this concept i think we're using simple components that are gonna be robust but not particularly innovative
very
yeah
we have the worry about how robust it will be if it's it's curved as a banana but spongy i think yeah
yeah
no
so that's false
no
yeah i think they're different aren't they
mm yeah
yeah
well i think our instinct is that it should be pretty cheap to develop we haven't got a lot of expensive components in there
i'd put it at one i think but i dunno what do you
yeah true it might be the yeah yeah true
true
yeah that's a good point
right
yeah
that was the crank wind up crank on the side
just one
uh uh yeah i think we can do it all with simple
just checking that
yeah simple 'cause we've just got push buttons so we can do it all with simple which is the ch should be the cheapest
yep
yeah that that one is single curve isn't it um do we have
i i think you it means you reverse the curve
yeah yeah i do i don't think we need that for either of them you can do a banana in single curve yeah

yeah can we do some what ifs 'cause it may i mean i i still quite like the idea of combining plastic and rubber myself but it depends on the cost i guess
yes
yep do we need to say how many buttons or
or d is it just one
'kay
uh they'll be rubber yep
actually does tha does special material mean that plastic is not a special material 'cause i think they can be plastic
yeah they could be plastic we don't have to have rubber buttons because we haven't got a double curved case
it's just one isn't it
what we're in
more profit
do you do you need to double click on that to open it
yeah yeah the play doh was best i thought
yep
yeah
yeah i think we're a good team actually
i'm not sure all the wires are really great though
i thought so
yes
yes oh hang on we haven't heard
mm hmm
absolutely and it's kept us within budget
and then we get the product launch party product launch party absolutely
yes
alright
well
yeah well you see each made one we didn't have enough yellow dough this is the one
that i made
it is uh curved easy to hold hand held nice and small with big easy buttons this is
like a scroll but they are push buttons and they enter takes you into the different menus of course we need
someone who's experienced with the television i mean this is the infrared thing that's
gonna zap at the television uh i'm not quite sure how to make that but i'm sure it will work
uh this is on off switch 'cause i think we do need that and i think it gives it a nice balance
and it's gonna have the logo imprinted on it uh in there um
as for what it's actually made of well the function of these buttons is up down left and right
in the different menus
uh position i presume that just means
right right on it easy to see the main feature of it is just a simple design simple lack of uh buttons all over the place right form
curved kind of smooth hand held makes it feel nice to hold
uh material i think kate's gonna tackle that quite a bit but i think we have two different options
because we did make a another one which wa uh is in the shape of banana it's just if you can
imagine this as yellow with black buttons like just like this but in the shape of a banana which is also
nice and easy to hold and feels good and has a similar sort of scroll
push button technology just a slightly different design also with on off switch
and infrared uh i had envisioned it in
hard smooth plastic
so like uh well i dunno what's it like i guess like an existing remote control but molded and smooth
whereas otherwise we'd thought like with this one or mix and match just we were gonna see what you thought the uh a more spongy rubber cover with spongy buttons
so we have the two options we can follow either the smooth hard plastic or the spongy rubber depending on cost restraints and what we
well what conclusion we reach when we discuss it
uh material yeah that's what i have to say about material can i scroll down on there and see what else
well colour i think i definitely have a preference towards bright yellow
with black buttons because that's the company colours but if anybody's got any other suggestions
i'm quite willing to consider them as well
so it just depends what you think about these ideas and if i'm yeah maybe kate you better say what you think about them

i thin as for as for the fruit or organic theme i guess this one is obviously
fruit shaped this one has n banana yeah this one has no obvious connections
to fruit but because it's round and molded
it kinda makes you think sort of organic touchy feely kiddie it's more like yeah you'd expect
it to be like a child's sorta toy remote control instead of a real one which i
quite like that sort of image 'cause it's very big and chunky and child friendly
and
hold them you see you know curvature is it to your liking

if you don't wanna tire out your thumbs after all
yeah

breaking oh right well you see that's why hard plastic would be quite a good thing for it because then it'd just be rigid
yeah we really like we really like that design i mean it looks just like a logo that arrangement of the keys
like a c like a compass point you know just up down left and right and we think we could make that quite a good feature and
it's like the the ipod scroll wheel but better yeah yeah
yeah i mean it that's what it makes me think of mobile phones i was try i was thinking moving your thumb like this what does that remind
me of it's texting
hmm
yeah
i mean the thing is we do need to develop our technology of i mean actually how to program the menus
and what sort of you know text box is gonna appear at the bottom of the screen but
we do definitely think that it's a viable option
uh yeah we're finished
yeah what about price is that gonna go on there as well price of materials
not that we actually know anything about it but we can we can pretend
it depends what what you mean by fancy really 'cause when i think of fancy i think of it's got lots of extra sort of fripperies and you know like
baroque curliness and which
i'd call these quite uh minimalist
simple and plain but i mean i do see what it is heavily reliant on appearance instead of pure functionality so in that respect it is quite fancy
i think just maybe we need a different word other than fancy i'd say maybe aesthetic
like stylish or aesthetic
fancy
did you just break the pen
well d we'll just call it fancy then
yeah i think we n we need to they're both yellow with black buttons it's just that we didn't have any more dough to represent uh that
but if you can just imagine banana shape with these bits as black so what we re really need to decide is whether
we want the actual banana shape
or just a a purely blob or some sort of abstraction in between the two that isn't that is more curved like a banana but that isn't actually recognisable as a banana you know with the grooves and the stalk and stuff so
so that's maybe not something we have to decide just right now is it just somewhere a long the scale of in between these two

yes
oh yes
well maybe only a two or a three then 'cause it's no we still haven't decided about specific sponginess or specific
yeah i don't really think that's gonna work but
no
no
well it is quite it is quite quirky i think
it could be quite a good brand like
a good little object
oh we also need tho think about the energy is it the kinetic energy if it's it is gonna be environmentally friendly with the kinetic energy
yeah but we haven't
completely developed that side of it yet so we're not completely sure about that but yeah
yeah
i would say maybe a two 'cause we still we need to uh get somebody in who is good with the programming for the menus
and things i mean it's not just like i mean it's not like ev you know on a normal chunky remote every button res
i mean means something different whereas this one has only got the four buttons and they all they mean everything
depending on what menu you're in uh we need somebody to develop that
yeah
just putting no excess buttons
as for see if we're technologically innovative i'd say it is quite innovative because there aren't really
many that have this menu idea instead of all the extra buttons i mean i know we're not doing anything involving
internet or speech recognition
but but we are at the upper end of the push button market

well just kinetic then
it's the wind up
what does double curved mean i don't understand
oh no we don't need that no
single curved i'd say
i
i just wanna say plastic
it's just button
yeah
yeah
well yeah like the compass point one
yeah they could be plastic
great
yes
yeah
and play doh
yeah well 'cause i mean it's so hard to describe what you mean just with words and pointing at photographs and saying well we quite want this but imagine it rounder so much better just to go and
you know this is it this is what we want
yeah spongy
and i'd never heard of the kinetic energy before so good work as a design team because we
oh yes
yes
yeah and the the only false one is because we've chosen
to keep a simple old technology which if it works perfectly well i see no point in improving on if it works so
yeah so we do count as i think excellent or one
bring on the ice sculptures
yeah
that's what i said ice sculptures
is that the end of the meeting
red
agenda three
mm
i like the fact that on both of them the keys play such a prominent role
it's really kind of a
mm hmm mm hmm
yeah but it's also like texting you don't

yeah
it's also in terms of um being lost it's it's quite it looks quite different
you know i i d i have several four remotes and they all look the same until you get up close and you have
to you know this is really identifiable
mm hmm
mm hmm
no okay
um
shall i take your uh power
oh
okay this is going to be a heavily interactive evaluation
and the method here is to evaluate the new remote control in terms of the user requirements and the hot trends introduced
by the marketing department so this means we're going to go over the priorities that were raised
by uh the consumers
a as well as incorporate all of our insight into this uh evaluation exercise so i'm going to go and
use the whiteboard and i've made a list of criteria to look at
and so i'm gonna i'm gonna leave this up as the last thing but for the evaluation
it's going to be one is true and seven is false going over these different criteria so
one true seven false and i'm gonna now use the um the board
okay so um
fancy
technologically innovative
easy to use trendy
buttons
excess buttons good buttons
ugly
sellable
and other and in fact i hope that uh you all introduce some additional terms because these are things that um have been brought up some of them seem rather close like they overlap
mm yeah price
we'll put price up at the top

um
okay so
did you say uh okay so
wha how do we feel in terms of is this fancy
mm hmm
mm hmm
i yeah so in that respect i think we'll go with that respect
yeah
elegant
yeah no these aren't the exact terms that the um
yeah
elegant we're gon let's use elegant although the the the people the word on the street is is
yeah n that um
yeah uh the uh is fancy so let's let's take it to the next level
well okay so in terms of elegant fancy
we'll call it e f  um do we do we think that perhaps and maybe we should say the yellow should we go with the yellow in terms of i think that's a really superior they're both
yeah
yeah
yeah
as a banana
i think that many of us are abstract enough to look at the yellow one and say we'll call it the banana
and of the two i really like i m i like the banana but i i do like the chunk
no but i mean in terms we have to evaluate one of them
unless do you guys wanna evaluate both
okay
so we say true um
technologically innovative
yeah so we'll say we'll say uh false
easy to use
one is that inappropriate okay oh pardon me um
trendy s and i say specifically spongy fruity
okay
okay so two um
are there excess buttons
that is false um good well designed buttons intuitive buttons
true
ugly
people don't respond well to ugly sellable uh quirky you know something people like oh yeah yeah i do too
oh yeah
and i was i was thinking of other things um in terms of uh could we say it's cost saving
with the
yeah with the energy
it is going to be kinetic
yeah we'll c we'll say it's a cost saving enviro
uh so yes
well you're still in the play doh stage anything else including price do you have any idea about price or other features
okay
so true one or should i go to two or three
okay
um
other anything else you guys can thing of
and i'm gonna actually change a couple of these so then i'm gonna instead of ugly i'm gonna say it's attractive and then make that true so that 'cause i have to do an average and then um excess buttons
exactly
wow we're doing really well
yeah be you know so it doesn't ruin the polarity
mm hmm
or l c d 
yeah
well if you g uh let me know if if any of these um if you if you all can think of
any other um thing to change here if you th if you think i should change the innovative or
add other features if not i'll average those
okay
mm
so
um okay how about if i uh pass this back to you and i'll uh figure out the average here
thank you for everyone's help with that

one two three four five six
yeah
sure
yes

yeah
yep
i think with the marketing element of uh fruit shaped i i mean i that really opened my eyes
i i only speak for myself though
yes
i can give you a number um it's uh the average evaluation score is one point eight
eight so it means w you know i can i can spell it out there were six true
or ones four um pardon me two s
almost true or close to true so that was four points and then uh one false seven points
so seventeen divided by nine we're between one and two i would say that's ex excellent
in terms of uh ho how much we adhere to the ideals of the uh market place
to maintain old technology exactly
yeah yeah
yes
okay
nice
so we might have to wait
yeah
um i one thing i want to do is oh i think the meeting's done
yeah
um one thing i wa i wanna do is save everything in the right files because i don't think everything is saved
the right files final meeting market
right w welcome to the the first meeting of uh real reaction's uh um
development meetings for our our new television remote control uh this follows our very successful
entry into the the consumer market over the last year or so um which we want to
to build on taking advantage of the uh the the latest developments in in technology and the
uh the latest uh uh feelings in in consumer design and and demand
and uh we want to make this the the very best product th that's possible for everybody
uh one that everybody wants uh at a good price for the consumer and at a good price for the company
uh and to that end we need all to work together uh to do that
um and uh b in no particular order because ev everybody is uh just as vital
to this project um i'll just go round th the table andrew marketing
um m kendra with the uh um designing the the the user interface
uh uh and kate with the the industrial design um
what's uh the the th th project is is here to do is is to to get this this project up and moving
ev everybody is is free to uh say wh whatever they want uh
everybody has a contribution to make and uh
everybody feel free to interrupt me at any time to to say what you want to say
um in in terms of the immediate meeting the uh um everybody
knows everybody else everybody's worked for the the company for a while if if an anybody feels that they need to say more about themselves
please do if if if anybody wants to b briefly give their their background so that everybody's quite clear what
everybody uh uh everybody's experience is please do so
uh
in fact i'd i'd i'd welcome anybody to uh say something briefly about themselves in fact we will do that by by going round the table quickly and and saying what what contribution you you're looking to make so we'll start with andrew
right kendra
right at least means you haven't got any preconceived ideas so
yep good
okay very very quickly um this i don't want to make this meeting
too structured because the the whole idea is that it's a um you know a think tank everybody
says what they what they want to say uh and we don't want to be constrained by uh kind of convention
or uh uh slides on screens or or anything else um
but um briefly um th th this is what we want
to do the the remote control needs to be original there has to be something about it that uh other remote controls
don't have so that as soon as people see it they think um yes that's different uh
i want one um and that goes along with being trendy
uh uh you know the i want it
uh scenario user friendly as as we all know remote controls can be uh
uh very user unfriendly so we want to make ours one that people can pick up and think
oh yes that's it's obvious how that works uh and they also
want to look at the price and think oh yeah that's something that i may not need another remote control but uh
it's such a nice one i'm gonna have one and last but not least or indeed first of all it
it must make the company money and we make the company money by producing what the consumer wants
the uh the further work to be done is i the um the functional
design uh what it uh what it must actually do
the uh conceptual design uh how we actually
present that to the consumer and th the the detailed design i is uh how we get that
into production
uh now th the main design tool that we have available to us at the moment is is the white board
and uh uh let us very quickly
do what i what it says in the in the in the prompt slide here um
in fact i suggest to avoid everybody untangling themselves from the uh the the wires that we don't do that um
so i i everybody knows what whiteboard is so we'll um uh we'll do a virtual
drawing on the on on the whiteboard of of your your own uh uh favourite
animal but le let's go round the table your favourite animal
mm and why
uh huh
oh right uh my my wife says my beard looks like a badger's arse 'cause of the the white streaks in it kendra
uh huh
right okay
uh huh fair enough yeah i'm not sure that i've got any favourite animal to be quite honest i think homo sapien because of their their uh overall ability to uh uh
sorry
indeed absolutely yes tha that's um
okay and uh w we need to keep in mind here that the uh we want to sell this for for twenty five euro um
we want to m make an overall profit for the the company of fifty million euros so we're we're
looking at selling a lot of these um ag across the the entire planet
and and we're looking at a gross profit of fifty percent it needs to cost twelve euros
fifty to make um so we're not only looking at a
a very trendy original product we're looking at making it at a very good price
um okay um would anybody like t
like to to start by giving their o um sort of quick views of of current remote controls
no
any any thoughts about buttons or any oth other way of approaching the p the uh the problem
or anybody else strong feelings about remote controls are there you know bad ones they've used or good ones they've used or ones that they've lost and never found again
um what so wh what's in in what particular style features are you thinking about
uh huh
yeah d no i mean do you think there's a risk if it doesn't look like remote control people won't see it as a remote control um and uh
uh huh
any other thoughts about um th the physical appearance of a of remote controls
i mean th the thing that i immediately comes to mind is computer mouses which um
i mean y you get all sorts of shapes in the shops and s you know some quite fancy ones
um than the some from personal experience which look nice but aren't
particularly comfortable um any thoughts about
buttons or flat screens or uh uh
yes i mean the only thing is if if you're watching television in a in a a darkened room um you need to be able to uh
fi find the button buttons easily
yeah that's uh must admit i don't think i've ever seen one with concave buttons that's
uh certainly be different um
do we need it to uh i can't think of any re remote controls that i know of that actually light
up at all do we do we want uh
yeah
okay so andrew have you had any thoughts yet about how we might market something which there are already millions out there and that we want to uh uh uh t take over the entire
um the planet with
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
okay yeah yeah well i d i think an any uh any facets
that we identify w we aim need to aim for for all of um okay well
first thoughts on um
the the industrial design side
indeed
yeah
okay and um colours materials
kendra anyone

yeah
uh huh
right
yeah
okay that's uh
again i don't think that's ever been done before it's uh the sort of the sort of thing that would get people uh thinking yes that's something that i haven't got and uh
might need so uh andrew any thoughts about uh how we might market interchangeable fronts on on the remote control
yeah
yeah i think
mm mm right okay i think we've got um a good idea now we uh meeting is uh
needs to be k uh wrapped up fairly quickly so uh um we've got thirty minutes to
start looking at the um at the design in more detail um
then we'll we will reconvene in in thirty minutes and try to get some of these ideas uh
uh more formalised uh thank you very much indeed
uh i'm katie i'm the industrial designer and i'll just be i guess presenting about the the inter workings of our little remote control and uh yeah

uh 's horses no particular reason why




um
i think it's important that you should be able to when you when you press the buttons it'll actually pick up the signals from kind of anywhere and you shouldn't have to like contort yourself and twist your remote control to get it the t v  to actually pick up the signal
mm
mm

mm
mm
mm

mm
mm
mm that would be good
mm
mm

mm
oh i think it's it's remote controls are kind of a unique object 'cause it's you depend on them so much but you don't i i
it's you sort of just assume they're always gonna work you don't think of them as a comp like a computer can break down and you're kinda like oh well fair enough there's all these complex things
going on it's gonna something's gonna get messed up eventually they they just need to be very very dependable because people sort of take them
for granted and then if your remote control breaks it's
god forbid you actually get up and manually change the channel it just it needs to be very effective very
always dependable uh i don't think we should make it too small i 'cause i think it needs to it can't
be too big like you were saying big an and huge and um awkward but also if you make it too small kinda like you know how mobile
phones are getting smaller and smaller um it's just gonna end up under a couch cushion somewhere and um yeah
but so yes dependable and have a good medium range size
mm mm hmm
mm hmm
mm
well you could come up with like novelty ones like they've done with the the mobile phones you can get like different you know scenes from different movies and stuff on the remote control and sorta stagger the release of them and get people like oh i want that cover on it now and that'll keep them spending money
thank you
i'm kendra and i'm the us user interface designer and um i haven't had a whole lot of experience in this kind of thing before but i'm m so i'll be
working on the design
right yep i'm just open to being creative
um probably a duck i just i li i like the way they look and they're just nice animals
and i like how they can fly or swim or walk around or whatever


well i think i find a lot of them really complicated to use with all the different buttons and uh it's
handiest when you have one that works both the d v d  player or whatever and the t v  as well
um but that it's easy to if you can switch back and forth instead of having to
press a bunch of different buttons and so i think it's is best when they're clearly
labelled and you can see which buttons you're supposed to use you know
yeah
i think something that's comfortable to hold because sometimes you get the remote controls that are just those big rectangular things and uh they're kind of awkward to hold onto so something that's more comfortable that fits in a person's hand better
yeah
yeah
yeah
but maybe they could be concave instead of sticking up to have them be kind of down so you could feel them
better
oh yeah
like a like a mobile phone yeah


well most i think most of the remote controls now are either just black or grey
so maybe we should go with something different or be able to i was just thinking of um
what they're doing with mobile phones now how you can get the different um what are they called like the face plates that you
change so we could have maybe i don't know if it would be feasible to do something with that where you can change the
face plates or have kind of a variety so people can get different different things have it kind of
look how they want to different colours things like that probably just plastic because that's always
the lightest

yeah
yeah
okay
mm
oh my name's andrew i'm a i'm the market research
person for this uh for this meeting and this uh project for creating this new remote control and
uh yeah i'll be uh presenting information statistics on what people want to want
to uh get from this new design what people want to like and from a fashion point of view and the practicality
point of view

um badger uh it's it's got nice contrast with black and white and uh i feel they're underdog kind of status and they're the

make mobile phones and t v  remotes to make t v  remotes
yeah
think a lot of the time remotes that come with t v  players and t v s and d v  players like they aren't
like an area that's put a lot of effort into they're very boring very plain like it's very a very like um making a a stylish remote control would be a very like
easily put us one step ahead of the current competition
um
something that looks looks doesn't look like remote control so if you want something that looks like uh something that makes
you think oh what's this like this pen doesn't really look like a pen but it makes you think oh
so sorry that's a bit vague
uh i suppose suppose that's up to the marketing to
to make make people aware of the product
mm

yeah
well from the mouse idea you could remote is a piece of plastic with the big rubber buttons sticking
out of it which you press whereas if you want could all be flat and the buttons are very kind of
almost subtle that instead of being raised out of the device uh you push into device
you see like a mouse button
i suppose
easily yeah yeah
mm
mm yeah that would be good
mm hmm um especially if we try to sell what two million of them
oh sorry four million of 'em but uh
i think if w if we market it as as not as not well this
you c you could either market it as the point of view we could have the two we could have parallel marketing s schemes where you've got one where it appeals to people that want to
have the new device that looks cool is fashionable and like you just it's it's like uh it's one that rather
than ra i wan i want rather than a kind of a need relationship with the device but that might considering the act
what the device is for and the nature of some people might not like respond to having a device that they just looks nice therefore
they want it so make it practical at the same time i think it's this is gonna have to appeal to people that want
device that can enhance their living room uh but also a device that uh
is practically sound so um i dunno we'll have to decide which which angle we're gonna go to or both
if you
mm

um well we could either market it together by getting control in a set colour or with like you buy it with several
uh like
you ge you get the f uh the face plates with it when you buy or as a separate thing but
uh maybe thinking of that it's considering the nature of the device maybe a second thing like a second
campaign to market new facials for your to your might go a bit astray
since it is the kind of thing where y you generally get one and then forget about it unless you were trying to
mm
oh it's that's a that's a good idea
mm
yeah true

right well
welcome to the what should be the last of these meetings and uh it looks like we've uh done a good job here and uh
we'll just go through the the final uh the final details um okay oh the um
th the the minutes of the last meeting uh i think we'll take those as read um
okay the um th the the next uh thing we we we'll have a look at the uh th have a look at the prototypes and uh look at the uh evaluation criteria and finance and then uh
uh just tidy up with production and um and then we can close um
so f if if you'd like to uh present your your proposals

uh huh
yep yeah good good
uh huh yep right
uh huh
yep yep mm hmm
uh huh yep yep
yep
showing me age i don't know what i c ipod covers are like yeah yeah
uh huh okay yep right
okay
yep
okay good yeah
yep right
yeah yeah i mean tha it's it's a detailed point i just wondered i mean h how will people put these down i wonder right
okay for some strange re reason i had it in my mind that they'd put them down vertically but uh uh
yeah uh no because particularly if they've dif if they're gonna have it as a you know as a fashion item uh i mean it it's uh it it's just i mean it's just a minor detailed point but um as you say you can just make the base a little bit bigger and uh
yeah and uh it just needs another uh another logo somewhere is is is is all it gives gives people the option and if if say if they've got them um because actually have several upon the uh
yeah well
yeah but that that's uh but uh no the the the overall uh the overall concept is uh yeah yeah no no i mean that's these uh
yeah
but uh yeah but no th but the yeah the the the
yeah yeah yeah i mean it it's uh wouldn't wouldn't do that indeed yeah but th th but th yeah th b the these were all minor
minor uh minor details i think the uh the basic concept i i is is absolutely bang on
and the i it certainly meets our criteria of being uh of you know looking different um
so good that's that that's excellent um right let us um
what's on the next one oh right yes let's have a look at the um
f finance um now
we're given a a clear design brief uh
if i get the uh spreadsheet up
oh
oh right ah
good this is why we need to make these things simple so that the uh the the the boss can understand now i've
um this is the company's uh uh costing
for for various uh uh aspects of design and i i i've treated some
of these slightly uh liberally given the constraints placed on us um
i wouldn't know for in for instance if if they require us to have it in the corporate colours then that is not a special colour that's a
that's a standard colour uh so we're just simply on batteries the the one
th the one decision i've had to make is that um
we're we will have to find a s a regular standard chip to to do this with and
i i um i'm i'm i'm certain that they they are around so um
that i don't think is a a serious problem the uh the the voice sensor is is expensive
but we we made a a basic decision that that was absolutely fundamental to the to the design so that
that has to stay um then again the the the the shape of the case means that it's
it's expensive to uh um
l to make 'cause of the the th the double curves but on the other hand because of our overall fashion concept
um we we should exceed the the sales targets um
it's simply made of plastic so th that's uh that's no problem and uh
um just because the whole the colour of the the whole thing that's uh uh
there's some cost there um and uh
we haven't actually got a scroll wheel we we we got push buttons and and a simple uh um
slider so um and the and the the buttons are uh
uh well i do don't know that they're special colour anyway the the costings
uh come in at exactly on target at twelve point five uh but i thi i think we have a a very
strong case to argue that uh what what we've got is is so in innovative
and uh and different that um any any slight compromise we have to make on
on cost is is offset by the uh you know the
uh you know the the the the concept of it being a a fashion accessory and and having the the interchangeable covers
so uh um you know the if if if the management expect us to be techno
again fail again technologically innovative um that they they have to accept that
we we can't operate absolutely within uh the constraints that they give so uh we we we
present this as the uh the company's uh the the company's way forward and uh
uh i i think we can argue that we we have uh come in on on budget
um
okay uh
so um
does anybody want to uh uh andrew do you want what do you want to say about um
the uh yeah the evaluation where where you know well where where we're where where we're at
the the the well the i meant the product
yeah oh sorry yeah um mm
mm
more loud clicks in the microphone

seven being a nice round number to work to
tr
on for true and seven for flase
yes
well i think most definitely
yes the voice technology indeed
i don't see we could've made it any easier
totally
no
yeah
found easily yeah i mean that's that's
yeah
does it take long to learn to use shouldn't
less buttons so it must be
so yeah um um
i think it will because i mean uh old older people who can't manage the buttons anyway will actually probably like the like like the voice bit so
and it's it's it's well i don't think we're actually
charging a particular premium anyway in the end so
yeah yeah
it will appeal f for dif for different reasons but it's it's uh yeah yeah so i i yeah i
yeah so i think we can reasonably say it's another another one why not
in in in in my interpretation of management's instructions uh is that yes it
it meets the requirement is t it's television only it's it's simple to use um it's it's
it's within budget um i it's uh yes an an
any minor points we we we argue
so uh i i think we've done an amazing job in uh
coming up with what
need a need a calculator for that
okay nick the cable back then ooh right do um
either of you want to uh say anything
mm
before i uh
no
yeah
yeah
well that's right i mean th this this slide here i mean the satisfaction with uh room for creativity i mean i think we've allowed
ourselves uh as much creativity as the uh the the the product uh
allows um i won't comment on leadership uh teamwork i think we've uh i think everybody's uh
worked pretty well together um we've just about coped with the whiteboard and digital pens
uh i think the results speak for itself and new ideas found um
again gi no given relatively everyday product
i think we've v very uh very effectively come up with a a new uh
uh a new approach um are the costs within budget yes is the project evaluated we're we're all happy that it it meets all the criteria um
thank you very much indeed i think that i think that's uh i think we can go f for an early bath so i call the meeting closed
not sure how far ahead of schedule we were there


uh okay we basically have the same kinda lay out here it's just um you hold it like this and it gets kinda moulded
to the to the shape of your hand basically um on the left we've got the scroll for the volume
on the right we have buttons for the channels up and down and that kinda so you can hold it and scroll or you can hold it and and push
uh this is the power key um it's kinda like the biggest so you know how to turn on
uh that's the little menu key this is the infra red section so you g it'll be sending rays and
if you're you know pointing it like that it can send it or if you hold it up like that it'll send it uh we got a microphone
there which for all the voice commands so you can you know talk to it like that and it'll still understand um
the logo is down down there um and has the cover on it and you can see like
it just kinda goes the red bit's the cover and it kinda goes over everything and then there's holes for the buttons to come through um
mm
mm

yeah
mm hmm
but it's also e e easier to put on versus like mobile covers you actually have to screw them on and stuff and you kinda sometimes have to get someone to do that for you this is very much you should be able to stretch it over yourself and it'll be fine
yeah
yeah
li that'll be the covers as well yeah yeah
yeah it could stand yeah well we could broaden the broaden it out a bit so it would stand like that
yeah standing
yeah we could just widen it out uh
mm mm
mm yeah yeah have to if we just lengthen it i guess so it comes down to the base of the hand and then flatten it out and could sit there
yeah mm yeah yeah
we might have to lengthen it so it kinda your hand still holds it and have it there yeah yeah yeah like that like that yeah
mm
the final product would actually stand up yeah
yeah yeah
yeah
wee
mm


mm
mm



yeah i'd say definitely a one yeah
yeah defi yeah yeah
yeah

yeah definitely
yeah
yeah definitely
yeah
yeah yeah mm hmm

no not at all
uh
yeah it is sorta the the handle more ergonomically correct as well
yeah
mm
mm
mm
i i i think it will tend to appeal more to younger aged groups just 'cause we have gone with the fashion focus and the younger people tend to would be more conscious of that aspect of it but um i think it should still appeal on a certain level to everybody yeah
yeah yeah
yeah yeah
yeah
mm



yep
mm hmm
mm hmm yep

yep
well done us

excellent
oh no that's
uh

mm hmm
mm yeah definitely
mm hmm
mm
yep
yep
cool thank you

mm s
and so we figured it would be kind of you know a light weight plastic just kind of a light non descript grey so that people'll wanna buy the covers and then the covers will be that sort of rubbery material like they make ipod covers so they kinda just stretch over

yeah well i i didn't know that but yeah they're kind of it's just kind of a rubbery and that way you know spongy like is something that people wanted and it just sort of stretches over and that way i think probably helps protect it a little bit too as well and
just kinda stretch it over
and it'll just stay on and then the buttons come through and so and then the each one of 'em on the very end will have the logo with the yellow circle and the r r 
yeah
like that
oh
yeah
yeah just kind of
or just make it little
somewhere like that
so it just sort of
yeah
bu
fall over
yeah
yeah
's a little longer
yeah


i think it is yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah i think it made we met all of the consumer
wants
no
yeah
yeah
yeah
i think so
yeah
yeah i think just the simplicity of it and
not having to learn to programme and not having you know a million buttons

under the cost

yeah
i mixed up the colours a little bit
i think i all wrong
mm
ps i don't think so i mean i think we worked well together and looked really at what the consumers
wanted and what we were trying to make and you know seemed to discuss things pretty well and
come to group consensus and
yeah
yeah
alright
yeah

okay
could have one for your stereo one for your d v  player

yeah i kinda had a
a kinda a natural kind of a idea where it's like more of a kind of like a kinda maybe slightly like thinner yeah kinda like that kinda like a flower or a plant for the more natural kinda
uh yeah just click there
uh the
the maximise button

evaluation
the the product or the project
um well well my presentation just now sure uh can i get the
cheers
there we go oh
method of evaluation testing the product was to just if it met all the criteria all the conditions that we set out to
set out to solve from the point of view of the the consumer and the management so
what i've been asked to do is on the whiteboard
um gauge
our team response to these questions so on a scale of one to seven one being true and seven being being false
yeah
and then at the end just take an average
yes
so uh
so look at these questions is the device f flashy and fashionable
so uh and also uh technologically innovative
easy to use
uh suitable for the consumer that was um
yeah
uh is it complicated
doing pretty well so far aren't we uh functional
um
where are we
we've b built in the the speech where are you function
uh huh
mm hmm
and uh what else the r s i  compares to the current standards well
we we uh yeah it was our it was a we made an actual effort to

um will device appeal to all age groups
yeah uh that's a good call yeah well we had the we had the data saying that old people will be less likely to pay extra money but the funct the increased functionality the e ease of use of the device might make up for that
mm

uh can you just click the my mouse to move onto next page uh yeah and what h did we make the management's

um
okay
so uh one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven eleven divided by eleven's one so equals average of one
and that roughly concludes my evaluation of the of the product


oh
okay
thanks for coming to this meeting s how we doing on our remote we have some we have some ideas and some uh
ideas for what people want
yeah alright let's just go over the agenda real quick for this
meeting see if i can't get things uh moving along here a little bit better um i'll go
over what we went over last time which shouldn't take long
then i believe each of you have a presentation um i've was sent a a couple
more requirements for our remote what they want um then we
can come to a conclusion on uh what we want the remote to do
um and how it's going to do it hopefully
and uh then we'll have the closing um which we'll have forty minutes for uh let's see the last meeting we went over um
who was responsible for what i'm responsible for leading the meetings keeping the notes
uh and coming up with the final presentation um
corinne is our marketing expert she's gonna figure out what what um the
consumer wants um ryan is our user interface designer
and manuel is the industrial designer so you're gonna come up with
the ideas ryan and you're gonna pick 'em apart um
we decided our remote uh we want it to be a universal remote uh that
everyone would want
um we want to be modern um fun different uh it needs to be
sturdy um easy to find so we gonna have that locator function
um and we want to be different
um and then we went over a couple of different ideas ball shaped phone the keyboard shape um we decided
that it should probably be one handed something we could use with one hand um and
that was our last meeting
so um why don't um do each of you have a presentation
okay i'll hand it off to you and um
does anyone do you wanna go first so we can maybe see what uh what the people want
to go to the next one yeah you click on that guy yeah


hit f  eight again
i think
yeah
you want it to be on both screens or just just yours
yeah but i think you have to hit escape
and then you can
yeah
oh hit f  eight again
i know i did the same thing
and then it should come up
here shortly
'kay
i think oh give us the slideshow and something on your screen mm i'm not sure you could maybe minimise that screen and then
have them both up at the same time i think
'kay very nice now we actually have some ideas of what what people want what we should focus on uh
wait can i look at that real quick
what was your last conclusion on that one focus on uh the i
the image of it
'kay good good

so we could the the the more complex we make it of course the more expensive
but people have said that they would well younger generations of people have said that they would pay more for a speech recognition remote so
possibly it might be worth the investment
i agree
well
i myself i find when you h when there's something like spee speech recognition like uh
you call on the phone and you try to change your telephone or power or something sometimes they have a a speech recognition
on the other end and you say one for this and you find yours like you said saying the same thing over and
over and over
i find myself especially if i'm in a crowd of people looking really silly so maybe if you're sitting on your couch with a bunch of people then
you know you
volume up volume down change the channel you know channel up channel down i i don't know
mm hmm
it's a it's a gimmick factor that they like at first and
okay um
let's see here
yeah i guess so
trade you
now i was sent a couple of
things to modify our uh
new requirements um the remote's only gonna be for the television which is good because we already
decided y your your research showed that uh not only is a universal remote more complicated
it's more cost more costly and your re uh research showed that you know most
of the people don't even use it i think uh you said fifty percent of the people only use half
the or ten percent of the buttons so if we remove the universal remote then that solves that
problem um no teletext um
so we don't have to worry about that um but we do have to use the the company
wants us to incorporate the corporate colour and our slogan which is we put the fashion
in electronics and our corporate colours are grey and yellow
and we could probably get away with black too but
so those are the three um the three new requirements that that i was told
we need to use um from all all three of your uh presentations i think that we were on the right track a lot in our last meeting um
we want something that looks good um we want something that's simple we want something that you can find easily um
and the speech recognition i i guess is kind of uh give or take it's gonna cost more s the young the younger people say that they like it but um it's
probably i would say probably not worth the investment at this point in time so maybe we should just do away with speech recognition um
and that way we can focus on our form
that'd be that'd be good if we were going with our our ball
or or with you know i guess with any form that that would be good you know that could be the charger for
you know we could use rechargeable batteries in the remote and that would be or solar
or you know however however you wanted to go about it the holder could also be the charging unit um
with the locator button
um and if it were the ball you'd no longer have to have a flat space on it
um like if we still have the how to hold on to it and
it's gonna roll away
um
so i guess after the meeting we'll have some questionnaires and uh
and some summaries for for what's going on um then we'll take lunch then we can come back and uh work on our individual work
um
i'll do the minutes
uh let's see
it looks like you're already on your way for uh
working with the components um chips the what chips we need and what uh
you know how to power it and whatnot
user interface concept we want it to be something simple
um
minimal number of buttons
i guess our i guess our main um
main thing that we should focus on until then is probably deciding on a certain look you know
did you have time earlier to to work on that did you guys feel you have enough time in between our meetings to get everything done that you need to get done
'kay
mm hmm
um
shall we maybe shoot for a a specific uh target group
that way we could l i mean
if it were if we were shooting for young guys then it's um a certain look to the remote or girls or older people
um
would that you think that would help us find um a specific form
that we would would wanna pick out

'kay
so
um we know that the remote's gonna have to be we'll just say we've got a colour scheme for it um
yellow and you know yellow it's nice and bright with the buttons being grey or black and our slogan
pasted somewhere on it on the the bottom or the you know um
maybe we could sketch a so basically
all of our remotes all of our typical remotes now are just kind of a rectangular sort you
know um maybe we could flare it or something you know
so it's more of course this will look like a bone then
go ahead and erase this um
hope everyone memorised that uh
yeah yeah
yeah everybody's got a mobile phone right except for me now uh
but they are all you know mobile phones um they've kind of taken a turn to where they're really small
um which may defeat our purpose for being able to locate our remote all the time
but then again you don't want you know like the first mobile phone that was this big
and you had a handbag to carry it around in um
so we've got basically what
remotes look like now is kind of what we're
what we're stuck with um
maybe we could go with a square or something um
um you know with minimal number of buttons
i guess you've got you know one through nine
for typing in your channels uh you've got
volume up and down channel up and down
power
usually at the top um a mute
that's that's pretty much all you need i think um
a menu button maybe
so you know
if you if we want the remote to do other things like um or i guess
the t v  to be able to change the tint and the colour and you know all those kind of things that are built into t v s
we just have that under one standard menu button where you go in press the menu button scroll up and down to select it
um
'kay so
um
mm hmm
like a wheel on your mouse
sort of
's a good idea
mm hmm
look g yeah looks good
to the thumb yeah
yeah is everyone who in here's right handed left handed you guys all right handed yeah so i'm left handed but i so i can say that most things are designed for right handed people
like the written language or english
maybe ow i would say i mean it should be probably designed for a right handed p person
um but that's that's good that's w i think we've got a kind of a good plan there um
at least for what buttons we're gonna use um
so we've got uh
i like the scroll the scroll action and the
yeah kinda like holding a
yeah
so two remotes in one
but then would be easier to lose
one or the other
it actually is your coffee table
okay well we need to finish up here um
so for the next
so for the next um before the next meeting w uh sh shall we work on you're watching trends to see what what kind of new information we've got going on um
manuel you're going to work on the components for for what we're gonna use let's go with our our uh rounded
kind of fit in your hand let's explore uh the the uh possibility of having the two piece
so one for the the quick zapping um and possibly one you know with just that
rounded part that fits into your hand um
and ryan you work on um how how well they'll work with the us with the user so both of those concepts
and uh okay i think we made some good progress here see you in
i dunno i gu i guess we'll take lunch
in about uh half an hour or i guess we'll be taking lunch shortly and then then in about half an hour after that we'll probably have another meeting
okay

eight f  eight

just jus yeah
cable there thank you
okay gonna talk to you about the working design of the interiors
basically which is what dictates the design the
both the interface basically and the outer appearance because this is all the stuff that
needs to go in there right so unfortunately the people who were supposed to
do this little presentation for me obviously were too drunk to actually accomplish it so um i'm going to do a lot of the stuff on the board um just
this is the basic
basic premise of a remote control um the basic function is to send messages to another system
okay so much is clear an energy source feeds an integrated circuit like a chip
that can compose messages often in the form of infrared bits this is the most
mostly used um there's uh also some sound systems but infrared is
the better or the more more used system um parts are cheaper as well a user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages
this is where my people screwed up basically so i'm going to explain that on the board rather
um what we have is different components that obviously need to go
in there we'll start with an energy source right um
which is usually a battery right
since it's not feasible to add a cable to that this energy source of course is connected to
the
the user interface itself uh which can be buttons whatever which in fact
controls a chip right this is the user interface and there we have the chip um the way this goes normally is that this chip then controls an infrared lamp
that sends out the signal
of course the signal differs accordingly um depending on what the chip tells the infrared lan lamp and
of course that's controlled the chip itself is controlled by the user interface the way you normally normally do it is that you add a little device such as a lamp
to the whole thing as well so that you know that it's working basically you press something you get a response
which is also comparatively um important on one of those devices
now this what we're talking about here or what i think should be discussed are these two components mostly the
the uh energy source for one thing can be altered what we probably cannot alter
is of course the infrared the sending device basically the infrared
lamp we cannot change the chip which controls the infrared lamp right these two
are components that we have to use and these are dictated by the whole function of the whole thing
um the lamp can be put onto the desi the device it c it doesn't have to be there
this can be discussed as well
the user interface that's something we can also discuss um as we've heard
uh speech recognition is the hype obviously in the moment
speech recognition um interface we don't know that or if we just
do the usual button thing or we have a touch pad or something like that that's something we can
discuss and of course the energy source batteries solar cells
who knows

of course it's always a question whether these these components are in fact available cheap enough developed enough but that's like i s i suppose rather up to marketing and not to
to the industrial design department
expensive it's gonna be get uh yeah
right
oh right
go
mm hmm
well you still do you s you still
w yeah you put it on t on the couch table while you're watching it's gonna roll off so that's not an issue really
right
that's
mm


right
hm
that's the classical design
right
yeah
talking of which maybe a scrolling function is not not too bad
it's
talk about maybe f look at that from the side there maybe
which is technically the easiest option would probably be like a scrolling little scrolling
wheel like this yeah yeah yeah so
yeah sort of like that you can even
if we're coming from mice we can even add a click function where you in order to verify the information you just press it down
right also when it comes to the ergonomics of the whole thing if you wanna make it square for the looks of it
then maybe to make it more comfortable to hold the whole thing
you add a little bulge down here just which maybe from an engineering point
this could be holding the the batteries and so on
i know you know what i'm getting at here fel look at it from the side it's like that right uh
then you hold it in your hand like this and maybe you bring the buttons nearer to the or the imp more important buttons nearer to the to the side right mm
right you can also have it maybe talking about mobile phones again sliding open
with the lesser used functions on this part and then it slides into that part and out
mm well i was just thinking this this of course causes
causes a problem um for left or right handed people actually so
right
right

that's right

right
that minimises it size wise as well
mm
then there's maybe
another point of making it a two in one kind of thing if we have a smaller
a smaller device that actually fits into the big one you give it the full functions in here and just a couple
of functions in there like your zap zapping device is just u channels up down
uh volume and on off that's it
maybe
that's right
means the big one has to be sufficiently big and perhaps heavy so you can't move it around
make it a piece of furniture yes yes there you go
or a statue or something
right
alright
alright
alright
du

uh we yes s i've lo i've done the role that i was asked to do anyway i think

slide show
just press the arrow keys i think usually goes to it
is is it j just just just using it yeah
a repetitive strain injury
just repetitive strain injury i think that's what i guess
yeah
having just listened to what corinne just said i'll draw on some of the things as well some things that sort of relevant to what i wanna say
'kay so i'm just gonna yeah approach the technical functions design
um the method i used was to explore the uh technical functions
of a remote control and t s simplest approach that i came to is is to change programme and operate
an electronic device remotely i mean that's an obvious thing to say but it's not attached to the device that you want
to control
um i had some things sent to me not very much to look at similar devices um defined
in some them and then the personal preferences that i will suggest um
we discussed a universal one um like it's just been brought up again then
but i think a universal remote control is actually quite a difficult object to design
and po possibly within maybe the budget that we do it um because you'd need to know
all the spef specifications of a all the like electronic companies i'm not sure have you ever come across a universal remote control
yourself
but you have to i they're a nightmare to use you have to set them reset them to everything um and that would only add buttons
whereas i think the aim is to take away buttons so i think it'd be better maybe to concentrate on maybe just a universal one
for t v s um or maybe just one that you could we could design and then
different people manufacturers could use it to set to their specifications if if the aim is to get something that's unique in design
um
okay here here's just two pictures of remote controls they're just simple t v 
remote controls but one is uh user centred that is the one on the left
and you can straight away see there's less buttons and the other one is engineer centred where that's more
uh specified for the sort of the elaborate piece of equipment it's trying to control um
which appeals more to the product that we want and on what the have said and the market research and stuff probably looking at something that should be user centred
fewer buttons simpler to use and if ten percent um is hidden away if ten percent is what's used maybe the
other fifty percent the buttons that are used very rarely like programming they could be hidden maybe
under some remote controls you might have come across have maybe a little flip thi thing where they're hidden away and the main buttons are the ones
you or the ones you come across
um and finally um uh sort i've sort of covered that our product i think should be user interface orientated um
like i said to concentrate on t v  remote control a universal remote might be too complex um
and as what it the major findings market researchers have said it's the image
and the appearance that people di dislike so that we should concentrate on something that would set a trend and then
and change the fashion of remote controls
and that's it
on something on the image of it uh the f the actual design
i think speech recognition was
uh one of those things where um they have to be really good for them to work 'cause sometimes you find yourself just saying things over and o if it's on your phone
and you need to sort of take into light languages and then different dialects i suppose as well
yeah
yeah
and wou i don't know if would would you want to keep saying stuff if you were watching stuff if you were watching something would you sort of be wanting
yeah
i think
as well it'd be j the gimmick factor for the younger people but practically i don't think it's
yeah it'll wear off
do you wanna put your cord back in
i did have have a thought about the sort of the tracking thing is that if it came with maybe a holder
or holster whatever you wanna call it um that you you should put it back in your remote but if you don't put it back in you press something like a little button on that and that just sort of sends out a beep to find where it is or something just by infrared that shouldn't be too complex i would've thought
yeah it would be quite good the ball could sit on a
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
i'll yeah i'll have a look try look at the actual appearance in the next break
i th i i do still think it needs to be something that is ultimately one handed the ball is probably not a good idea and even something that's held like that might be difficult so that i think it still has to be a variation
on maybe a
a rect on a rectangle but maybe not necessarily as
boring as plain as a rectangle
d i don't know if that might cope with like the trend watching i find anything more on that
yeah
bottom perhaps yeah
you i mean it might be to look at sort of the the shape and trend of like things like mobile phones and the shapes that the they've been going they've gone from big brick block things which is a remote control is to sort of slinky small things

yeah

yes s
to the thumb yeah maybe the buttons could like uh
decrease in s the bigger ones you know they could actually be bigger in size than the ones that are less important the smaller here
yeah
behind definitely
just like o on a sort of side view
something that you know it would sort of fit in the hand better so you know you just sort of have your hand
yeah right on the and your thumb would be up here type thing
yeah that's also true
instantly sort of always going for the right handed person
but i mean the older so
right handed yeah

i mean i'm just just thinking maybe
if it was um
circular
um
with the sort of that sort of the sort of early idea we had with the way that was more like that whereas this is just a one handed thing that you sort of almost wrap round the thumb so you'd have your you'd put your hand into there with the thumb there
and then your thumb would do you'd have all the buttons sort of round here and that i think could work on any hand if you just had it like wrapped round there left or right
minimise its size it could be you know really quite small
yeah
zapping functions


yep
yeah
how well it'll work yeah

yeah
hm


yep
sure
what was it function
f  eight
well

how do i get it
oh right right right
that one okay
alright well this is my report which is going to be
based pretty much on a survey that i was sent
oh gosh i've no idea g
okay sorry i actually need
to see something else on my screen

yeah
and then again
no i want something else on mine
is that possible
okay but now you don't have that
sorry guys


so is there no way i can give you the slideshow and
have something yeah yeah oh well
yeah
it's okay okay um so first of all the method that i used was
by doing some marketing research by um doing research on some interviews that were conducted
and then some internet research
and i was sent a report that was i think there were a hundred remote users
that they interviewed and so i will show you some of the results from that which i think will be helpful
um okay here are some of the findings they said that the users dislike the look and feel
of their current remote controls and seventy five percent of the users find their remote controls to
be ugly which is a fairly significant number i would say
and eighty percent of the users would be willing to spend more money if they could get a remote that would look fancy so i think that earlier we were onto something when we were talking about having it be a modern cool look i think that's definitely important
um they say that current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user
seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot and if anyone could clarify what that
means zap does that just mean like changing the channel okay
um and fifty percent of the users say that they're only using ten percent of the buttons on their remote
control and there was something else they kept
track of the frequency per hour in using certain buttons and some
of them it looks like barely need to be included at all of course channel selection is used the most frequently
and then teletext was the next volume and then power and then
audio settings and screen settings and channel settings were practically never used so
i think we could definitely eliminate or somehow combine a lot of the functions into one button
um the biggest user frustrations as we said fifty percent of people
find that their remotes are lost somewhere and so i think a tracking device of some sort would be a good idea
they said it take thirty four percent said it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote
and twenty six percent said that the controls are bad for r s i 

what is it
okay okay and so bas okay
um as far as speech recognition goes um the younger group
looks like they're all for it from the fifteen to twenty five age group over ninety percent said they would pay
more and it kind of just went down incrementally the groups at
the older they get it looks like the less willing they are to pay so maybe we could discuss this and think
and decide if we think it's worth investing in this at least if we're targeting the younger groups
and so in conclusion some things that i drew from this are that i think we were correct we definitely
need to focus on a new modern appearance since so many people seem to be concerned about the ugliness
of their remote control um a multifunctional remote could be a good thing to explore so you only have
one rather than five different remotes sitting all over your room
uh we need to simplify the remote and reduce the number of buttons get rid of the ones that don't seem to be serving much purpose and then lastly i thought that maybe we could discuss the idea of speech recognition
and that's it

oh yeah
sorry did you guys get time to write everything that you needed 'kay



mm hmm
yeah

another thing about these figures is ninety one percent of the youngest age groups said they'd do it but probably a lot of them that's actually their parents money like i don't know if they would actually go out and purchase this themselves a fifteen year old you know
yeah
gets old yeah
mm
mm
rolls away yeah
not really
mm
mm
mm
yeah not yet but maybe by the next meeting we'll have some info on that


mm

mm

power
yeah


mm hmm
right
uh huh
maybe you could buy like a special left handed version of the remote special order
yeah
mm
hmm
could be good
yeah yeah
mm hmm

okay uh first of all i'll start with the costs because that's going to influence our design if you don't know if you al already had a look or not
because we have a problem
if you look closely you can see
um i already took the liberty to make some suggestions
at the moment we have fifteen buttons one l c d  screen one advanced chip on print we use a uh sensor that's for the speech uh we use kinetic energy
and we wanted uh the buttons in a special colour
okay what's the first thing we should drop the special colour of the buttons
okay
uh
should we switch to a hand dynamo uh that's the still the same idea as the kinetic energy because you have to use it and do things
batteries
batteries
yeah
so
you're going to redesign something okay so we're at twenty five um
do we keep the shape doubly curved or g do we go for single curved
mm hmm uh
yeah um uh another option i saw was to drop the buttons
one through nine so you can't directly access a channel but instead use only the up and down
arrows that would skip nine buttons and four and a half euros
yeah
uh then we have left
uh yeah we do
they don't need special colours fine that's more like it you were saying something
yeah
mm hmm
yeah
yeah some more menu options yeah okay so maybe we can drop few more buttons but um now let's look
mm hmm
uh
yeah scroll wheel push button uh
yeah
yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah
yeah
uh yeah
yeah it's uh one integrated button is five times the cost of a normal button
so
you could also drop j three more of these without losing much functionality you just drop the okay and the back
oh that's for the speech
yeah
s s drop speech recognition
yeah that's possible
buttons that's not very easy to use


yep
okay because if you d lose the l c d  screen we need a lot of yeah we need a lot of extra buttons
okay so we drop the speech
and drop it yeah okay s fo four less euros so we still have three and a half euro to lose
yeah if you lose the the back the okay button uh v let's say we only have the four arrows and the menu button
then you're
oh and the power button we have also
yeah
so that's one euro
yeah
yeah and
that would save zero point two euros compared to no
yeah to this together is more expensive than oof it's almost the same as t keeping this and we can drop these two
volume
and the power button
that's the basic
yep
okay th that's yeah that's one euro more expensive
that's not an option
menu power
four arrows
power uh
yeah okay so four arrows uh power i believe uh
we have a back and a okay button
and the menu
yeah and even if we drop three buttons from here we still have to make some adjustments around here so

the l c d  yeah
then i rather make it wood because then also it's good in the market with the forty five plus uh people
no that maybe not but maybe it's better than plastic anyway
yeah yeah okay uh
yep yeah yeah
yeah okay plastic
uh that's easy because plastic is free

yeah okay uh if we dropped uh
yeah
you still need that
s
no i keep the re yeah yeah because we already designed for it so
yeah and something else
no y you would rec
then you have
then you still need two additional buttons i believe for the volume you can use those yeah
oh yeah and power that's three buttons and this would cost
yeah
three up down okay
yeah okay it would save enough yeah you can choose this drop these then we have a half euro left so we can maybe still use power button
yeah
yeah you see oh still yeah oh then i miscalculated oh yeah
shit drop the special colour
'kay what else uncurved
yeah
they made it very easy for us
ah i don't think i can s uh persuade the management to say this is better for the market so you sell more than
buttons that's oh yeah since we only have one button

i just m i don't i think uh yeah it's i think it's grey regular
grey and rubber
of plastic

yeah
yeah
no i don't think the current status of uh chips are pretty uh energy conserving no
yeah hand dynamo do you want an extra button


yep instead of an additional power button
yeah it's for scroll
without
yeah but it's just a scroll wheel which you can push down so
yeah
so woah we're within budget it's a miracle
yeah
okay um well
'kay this was old
yeah back to work uh
did i save it
yeah i i wanted to go but i wasn't allowed so
uh i just forgot to save this just a minute
yeah this the last phase of course so
hmm
oh
okay um
well we first should have had a uh prototype presentation but well as you saw that hadn't made no sense because we had to drop it uh
yeah yeah it was more important so i just
pushed up the agenda uh
evaluation criteria you have t produced something about that
uh you put it in the
yeah
f  five

alt up
freaky
yeah uh of course we dropped a little bit of those uh
mm hmm
two
uh y we should fill this in now yeah okay uh
yeah in the new design i s would say it's three but now in original design i say two
okay then i say three
hey you're marketing eh
hmm m maybe underline
red
oh yeah very true he types everything
everything you don't use anything else
yeah yeah okay yeah
mm hmm
nope
uh check with the excel sheet
yeah integrate it
yeah
just go scrolling and it will activate
it shows the most used functions and they are relevant but
you say you double click on the

no not anymore because he's now have a scroll wheel that you can push in
like on the the mouse
yeah
to get into menu yeah
or hold it ten seconds
no no no uh it should be trendy
yeah four
yeah im in the menu
five
it's the weirdest remote control i've ever seen so
well it's different
yeah
yeah it's still
yeah i say two
oh that's the next

two
yeah definitely

you still have rubber d or no
yeah
yeah the one button we have
yeah you could check with the excel sheet
yeah
yeah or three
we have something
new yeah
you like both

um oh yeah
i just couldn't um just one minute
so
no not anymore
yeah

yeah
yeah
yeah well yeah
no
yeah okay
so
ooh and yeah what
yeah
yeah that
count them add them or
could somebody start calculator
mm hmm
yeah yeah you have to 'kay so four and
nice work
o one
plus five
bo
uh two
four

start over
you can oh yeah
okay three four nine
uh
eleven fifteen
seventeen
s uh
that was the last one that was that yeah so divided by nine
so
yeah
divided by nine
so thr t two
so we're better than average
no
things yeah
okay
it's still yeah
has some shortcomings


okay so um this we had this we had
we have to do a product evaluation uh prototype presentation we dropped so
uh the finance we looked we have redesigned uh not on that but
so you can just make one big l c d  screen
yeah uh
the the button has a special colour the frame has a special colour
it's plastic and single curved
oh and you might want to add a uh infrared led
otherwise it uh doesn't function uh so well

well i have to um um make an uh report
of every decision we made so far and i try to get chip just before uh i uh receive
the excel sheet so i
yeah i'm i'm somewhere but maybe you can help me
uh
i was here so
ah
that's enough to get started with so
uh i just took one for every step and then a conclusion
yeah
well i think i have to make a p an issue called finance
yeah
mm hmm
 
 
 
 
 
 
i don't think so if you see the options but
yeah







you can't even draw anymore even children can draw
can you just push pen and then keep on
hmm

yeah
yeah just on the the m um the l c d  display
this is your real remote
yeah
yeah you can just reuse that because the name is the same initials
mm
luckily yeah it's uh yeah
okay and copy this just a minute
it's
it's somewhere
i d it isn't inside yeah and don't know how it's or eject it
from up there
no
yeah it's somewhere in here
save copy
yeah
yes
well


um now you probably have to recalibrate oh five minutes to the end of the meeting and the recalibration is done using this icon here

yeah well i just
okay you go ahead
yeah yeah then i have to uh uh write this and i don't know if you have to present because i didn't receive any information about that so far
maybe we get a a final mail
yeah yeah i have still ten minutes to finish the report
yeah
and you can uh just uh relax and uh have cup of coffee or oh no they don't have beer here so you can't celebrate you can just if you ma finish my presentation please
uh over there
the presentation is still open so if you finish that then you'll see uh
yeah next
oh yeah we have to do the project uh evaluation just uh do that quickly uh
uh well basically what that says we discuss it and um
so how were did the project process uh go did you were you all pleased with the process as it was or are there uh
yeah the interaction and the steps we followed and and so forth

yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
okay and was that due to my leadership

yeah
that okay
okay um was there uh enough room for creativity
so and the uh about the board digital pen uh was that helpful or
ooh

yeah it works
mm hmm
use the pen
yeah yeah
blink oh
okay are are there any new ideas about this all i think
i didn't really receive yeah
uh uh w uh s sorry uh
mm hmm
yeah
oh uh we should uh enter our questionnaire

ah
woah
okay uh okay
that's the management
hope so
um

oh no
no n i i already did it it's not much it's just one question
yeah
no that's that's for the trendy uh feel and look so

yeah b but
i think the battery option
oh
oh no
yeah
but we don't have any basic options any more

yeah we c could we only need the the the the the menu arrow arrow button uh thing everything you can do with with the menu so with the display
yeah
so you do one inte you can do one integrated scroll wheel push button and then just drop all the other buttons
but but th the cost of one integrated button is far more than a few extra push buttons
yeah so we have to to make it s uh more uh it has to be
could drop the speech recognition
we we d
yeah
yeah
we lose our whole concept uh so no we just we keep the l c d 
yeah

if we do uh two integrated scroll wheel push buttons we can drop all the the push buttons
with with one uh integrated button we can uh do the whole menu thing with the other we can do the the channel the volume et cetera
no it's three euros no um
no it's it's n yeah
yeah yeah yeah
it's the

let's make the let's make the case plastic
yeah
but
plastic with a with a special colour a woo wood uh wood uh wood colour that's an option
yeah
so we do one one s yeah
hmm
no the buttons those are really needed
yeah th th it's it's uh
an advanced chip on print
oh that
but the
but the integrated uh button how many func functions can it uh have
okay
oh no
no no it has to be um curved
okay
okay wh what we could do is um
drop the the special colour and uh do the special colour for the buttons
yeah
just something else than than black or white i think
yeah

the display
the
but if you have to power the for ten minutes then the
yeah
no no it has to be curved yeah
just put a special special colour of the buttons or something
yeah or spe special form
yeah
yeah but it's it's for the integrated button i think also or
yeah okay yeah
yep
oh just oh ma make it two special colours but we only have one button okay
yeah okay


yep
two or three
two or three
yeah
yeah

or give it a colour

yeah true one
yeah
it hides uh basic functions
yeah true
i think we are
it's in oh yeah it was integrateds yeah

can you uh change channels directly with with just one button no you have to scroll through the menu before
yeah so it's it's not
no
yeah
oh no



seven
yeah five
five yep

yeah
i think a two no
yep
no you got a plastic
yeah
yeah you only have one yeah
four yeah
red

mm yeah yeah
it's the white part uh
yeah we have a we have a
mm hmm

ah i
and that you only have to control one button
it gives visual feedback so
i think a five five


okay yeah

yeah that looks uh great

yeah nah
yep
yeah s
yep
wow

no we put the electronics into the fashion
yeah four is okay

okay
three plus
plus one
plus five
oh wait a second oh it's it's gone wrong
okay it's your turn
no it's if you press twice on the plus button then you get s s
no that's why it's uh
just count it to yeah
sixteen
twenty two
twenty four twenty six
oh sorry oh my
okay twenty eight
hmm
some questions are yeah
oh yeah yeah
yeah
oh great
okay it's your turn now
yeah
yeah we we can just uh use this one and then uh over paint it with uh uh the green uh he only needs one button yeah or we have to delete this one or
oh oh no
okay
so that's
okay but how do we make the the scroll uh button it's just one yeah
uh that's the infrared uh thing
yeah
yeah
yeah um uh it's just a scroll yeah is it's horizontal or vertical
i think
yeah
yeah yeah
yes it doesn't look like uh
uh it it's it's not yeah
it's not very fashionable anymore but uh it's okay
yeah
maybe m make it bigger or
yeah
that looks little bit more uh
maybe that's a s a special colour for it so we can make it uh special
or or speckles in it i dunno uh

 
i'm not sure
yeah red is already a special colour i think so
it's not very special but uh
yeah
just uh put the purple uh purple on it that's trendy

woah
oh yeah
hmm
oh what
oh no
no no yeah
oh it's it's just one computer or
no
but can we delete it just with delete or
crashed oh no
okay
yeah over here hmm
what's this
oh yeah
oh that's the select button it's uh
no it looks
it's okay
specially the the r 
d designed by okay
no
do they have a lo oh the here this i this is the logo
two r s and a one
yeah

okay
are we uh ready uh or
is this uh the last assignment or
final
um bug bug
no it's in inside the
no it oh
hey you've got it uh read only so you have to uh
it's too uh
it is
it's now single curved so
it's flat oh no
okay it doesn't matter it's it's
that's the detector uh for the
okay
yeah i don't know
maybe that's why it's it's not working because it's more
yeah

oh oh yeah
yeah
you've to make it s uh
ninety degrees
you have
oh we're always long
yeah can we t can we get to that   i
oh it's not working anymore
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah it's it's working it's working
yeah
we're improving uh yeah
yeah
no it
so cake
no
no
yeah
yeah especially after the first meeting
and
yeah
yeah yeah yeah
yeah
yeah but only the the financial parts uh yeah
yeah
finish meeting
i think the powerpoint is is too limited you can't uh draw easy in in powerpoint it has to be uh yeah the drawing board has to be integrated into powerpoint so that you can just easily

yeah
yeah just for text for text it's uh it's okay but

'kay
okay
oh
okay
did you do your questionnaire already
uh
it wants
yeah but everything is
just a normal battery then yeah
oh my goodness
well i guess i we'll have to go for single curve then i mean we have to drop on everything
yeah
how about sorry
that's what i was thinking
a a
and uh 'cause then they don't have to n they don't need special colour as well
that was exactly my point like let's drop all the buttons and just make one i mean we're gonna use the l c d 
screen anyway so we'll just have to use it for everything and then you can make an overview of
channels in the screen and select a channel click


yeah we need one integrated button for everything then
yeah kind of i was because
yeah
if you if you go to if you go to our uh view like you if you are in the sound
system there uh and you wanna adjust the treble for instance this is just uh an example y y
you wanna see a bar on which you can adjust it from zero to ten for example
but you want a sound preview of how it's gonna sound right so you wanna click on it activate
it whe and when you move it hear the difference of the treble coming out or going into the sound
so you'll you'll need a a kind of a joystick uh button
yeah
exactly
yeah it's r yeah
no

no but
yeah it's it's expensive but uh we never considered the possibilities of uh speech recognition 'cause it can take the function of a lot of uh uh buttons
i
no
yeah but lets just say that the speech recognition works
we uh we we haven't really integrated this the speech into the system so we can might as well s drop that
we need to lose some buttons
which that's even

yeah if you if you go to eight i don't know how to
yeah we need the chip for the for the l c  display
yeah
true
oh
hmm
yeah uh
you uh uh
yeah so the other option would be to go for the the sample speaker and which can use a regular chip wh which is six euros in total that doesn't matter
well yeah
exactly
yeah but the uh can't we f uh fit all the buttons in an intreg integrated scroll push button 'cause that will save us one and a half euro already
and then if w
th then we have to scroll through a lot of menus to be able to get where you want huh and uh
yeah d at l yeah at least one for power
oh
yeah it's just as expensive as what we have now
yeah endlessly i mean it can be a power button as soon as it powered on you can go into you in you main menu you can choose uh flip channel uh you can choose sound options any options
yeah
maybe we should 'cause we don't have money and w we want the screen
i guess we have to
we'll we'll be on
yeah it says right here

yeah

but we definitely want the thing to be a special colour though damn
yeah and then
yeah yeah yeah yeah
well you only have to power it up when you wanna use it
i don't know
yeah
yeah
yeah yeah that's the most import
we only have
yeah but
well we come back to the drawing board then huh

it's silly 'cause we we should have had this meeting before we start drawing
oh yeah
okay

drop everything yeah
we went straight into finance
for yeah
yeah
mm hmm
i think it does because the operating behaviour of the young user was also defined in colour and shape and the use of l c d  right
yeah
well we have extended menus on the on the l c d  screen so
i
no
yeah
yeah alright
yeah yeah
definitely one it has to be
you're not gonna find them
yeah the next not so much so
yeah
yeah it's uh it's integrated
e exactly just like a m mobile

well uh we should b build it so that if you don't kind of push into the menu or something if when it's on yeah it's turned on
it automatically has the the programme and the volume function but as soon as you click it you go into the menu or some of you or you double click it
no because it has four arrows right
oh yeah
yeah i was thinking still about our uh integrated joystick
say
yeah that is a bummer
we'll make it a morse code


yeah
yeah i would go for five or six yeah
okay five let's not diss our remote
yep
just one button
but uh yep
we still have the fruit and vegetable print
fr oh i mean the oh never mind i'm a bit lost
it's way more practical yeah
yeah
yeah so we still uh we still have the primary colours but only on the on the outside not on the button
yeah okay
yeah yeah still we we dropped also on the the double uh curve
and and colour
yeah s
yeah
uh
actually we d we didn't do so well on this one because it's basically an old one uh with little
curve on the side and in a different colour still it's still hard i mean the sponge like
and the three d  shape that would give it something young and fresh
of course

yeah but it be because uh we couldn't hardly draw on the b s on the lower half of the screen we could not make it big enough to actually draw in the
so i mean i wanted to put digits on the buttons as well but
hell yeah if we have only one button
and even the shape we have now uh simulates kind of an r  and the reversed r  doesn't it so
no
the only e the only thing easy about it is that you don't have to move your fingers 'cause it has only one button
yeah exactly
i would say six
it's really not easy to use 'cause you're putting everything
most votes count um
definitely in casing 'cause we have a hard plastic yeah yeah because the the batteries those thingies last forever
and the the casing hard plastic also lasts forever
so i would go for one
okay yeah
oh
no m
i would g i would go for four
because we kind of tried to but we kind of failed with the budget that we have
yeah
yeah yeah yeah
that's it
ah we can do the math uh
yeah
did you make this questionnaire or what
oh

i wouldn't be able to do it that fast
f
pretty difficult
just type in the digits they're all one digit numbers right and then you can count them together
eleven fifteen
sixteen
seventeen
oh what
how hard is this never mind twenty four twenty eight
twenty eight
yeah the lower the the lower the score the better right
yeah but
but
i are you sure we this number actually tells us somethings i don't think so because some
questions are related to positive issues and some to negative so if you give
a true to a positive it actually means that the low the lower the better but if you give true to
a negative question
no
durable that's good easy to use
yeah also good
yeah okay
i guess you did do it
oh yeah yeah no
okay okay
yeah true
yeah definitely definitely because now it's just an average it's remote
yeah okay because of the l c d  screen but uh it looks and stuff it still uh it's not it's not really eye catching except for the colour
yeah
product evaluation
shall we try
black
okay uh we're still gonna go for the fancy colours but are we gonna stick with the green or are we gonna do blue
one scroll button and
for what
should give it some time
yay
have to take this away also
and this um
oh yeah of course um pen yeah format
current colour red oh yeah we did our special colour for the
line widths now that's a ten
it's gonna be one str scroll
horizontal's easier too 'cause you can
is it more natural than this
so let's say whoops 'kay
basically
it's really ugly
oh
what do you mean
like a other colour than this one
yeah can we do it uh uh can we do a print
i think we have to choose yeah
okay special colour we do have special colour
does it mean uh that
shall we just give it some dots to make it look pretty
purdy
purple
yeah yeah
oh no my remote has acne
no that's why we have that button
it's so cute
doh
is that that
how the we did we do that
we can try
that doesn't respond also to the undo it looks like it's
no
where do you want some more dots
okay it's not the prettiest i know
it's not so random huh


yeah okay
we can make a l a logo
like uh put it like the shape
something like that i mean it's not too uh
that's not their logo is it
yeah it's a

how shall we do the logo in black or not
are you dissing my drawing this one
it looks like a ribbon
so who wants to draw this is actually quite fun do we need to do anything
i hear you people are typing
oh okay
it's almost four
at four yeah
this is really bizarre
it looks like there's a it looks like a butterfly

no but it i it's not a bu a beamer b it's a normal t v  screen kind of thing
oh
yeah there is some kind of projection i think
with a with a mirror huh or something yeah
so are we gonna change anything to this i mean is it gonna
this is gonna be flat yeah exactly
yeah
yeah
and this is also gonna be
nope
but sometimes then uh all of a sudden it does work
maybe
no it's i think you only need two points or not
no you sh
slanted yeah yeah
well maybe
yeah it it matters for the aim of this thing

yeah
yeah it's only a bit like to that side but that is that one by the way 'cause this one makes the angle either like this so i if i change this it will go there if i change that will go there
mm hmm i will take this away 'cause it looks messy
maybe we will
what's this anyway
it looks like candle wax
uh th uh do you mean the the interaction between us or
yeah well at first i was really stressed because it went a bit fast but then as i knew the tempo that i had to be on the second time i think i did a bit better and the third time yeah i mean
yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah we
mm hmm
yeah definitely
well you did become more assertive the the second time round so that yeah you were more in charge kind of thing
i guess so
i mean
i
we were pretty democratic
yeah
maybe yeah
it's uh it's the the pen is more intuitive 'cause we're all used to writing with pen and uh as i said
uh i uh have no idea how powerpoint works so will take me half a day to be able to make a normal powerpoint presentation
but once i get to know the program probably i mean it looks better you know or uh something like
that you can
give it a kind of a home style like we have i
the the logo and everything and i don't know
yeah the the the problem with powerpoint for me is that you have to i put in the pre made chunks c as well you know you can draw something on the sketch board and then take it there or whatever
alright
alright
well s see you in a second huh
yeah we have to pull it this way huh wait
oh
no
oh

no
yeah but young people like that so just do normal battery
yeah
it has to be twelve and a half or not

uh yeah
but we can keep it single curved with uh top view
still curved but from the side it's it's flat and the screen screen is just
well you just have to hold it like this then so
alright let's do it then yeah we

f  eight
yeah
the joystick

integrated scroll wheel push button yeah
yeah or or the integrated scroll wheel push button so that's kind of on your mouse and then you can click it adjust it click again and then you're out of it but you still but you then still need to have
well you can use the scroll wheel as well for um maybe for the channels but you still um
you still have to have some some button in the menu to go back
yeah
well not all not s not sound i guess

mm
yeah wh wh what what what is the what is the uh sample sensor sample speaker
speech recognition
right
buttons
no it can be disturbed by by noise and
stuff like that let let let me see what's more what's more popular i guess the the screen was more popular than um than the speech recognition i have to look on that let me see

uh well no i was wrong there are more people who like speech recognition than an l c d  screen
but if it
but it it it's a it's a both a hypers
no but well we yeah we keep the screen i mean it's it's about the same eight one to ninety one percent uh sixty six to seventy six
yeah let's drop the speech
sixteen euros
but y y
yeah
yeah and then and then use um
the the okay and the menu button does also does the okay function then and then when you in the menu
s so so you activate the menu
yeah yeah
yeah
well okay for example if you have f f four buttons channel up and down uh volume left right okay i've i think we have to keep that and then and the power button so that's five
that's basic that that's what you need anyway and then for the menu um you can have a button that activates menu
or d or do we just integrate an an an scroll wheel with a push button and then if
the moment you use the scroll wheel the the the menu gets activated and then you can scroll choose an option click
on it it goes into an feature click on it again selects features scroll adjust it click again it's okay
then you only need one button to move back
or or under each option you set a you set an a screen thing what says back and you
select that one click again and you go one step back and in that menu scroll click one step back
so that then you need five buttons and one integrated scroll wheel
push button
but we can't drop three buttons but i see that's yeah so that's not a good idea
because which buttons do we have now those five which i mentioned and then menu and then
yeah f of the four things yeah th power
which more
yeah power th yeah that's five
yeah okay that's seven and one to activate the menu yeah so okay that's eight well we can't reduce that we we keep the display
oh well okay
yeah

yeah well we need the advanced
instead of r
yeah but but that's not our market
ah no hard plastic
yeah plastic with special colour
no but i i because we have to use the special colour anyway you forgot that so let's go for the plastic
and since it's not kinetic it doesn't have to flip around that much
we still have problem of two euros

yeah we can't drop them
do we really need that advanced chip for an l c d  display
oh i rather keep i rather keep the display so the only option is an hand dynamo
oh no tha oh that's one euro right
and then integrated s yeah but that would make it not so easy to use i mean it's not that important easy to use but
yeah
you you press it for like three seconds
then then then you should do everything in the menu on the screen
yeah
yeah but we'd alright
it s it saves us four euros and it costs us two and a half
so let's see we we drop the price by one and a half but we still have thirteen left
thirteen so still half there goes the special co well that would make it less appealing so that's no option
we sure about the advanced chip we need for the display
well yeah yeah we made it hard for ourselves with the display but it's a cool feature

yeah but i mean what is meant by special colour
s yeah alright
yeah so i rather have an hand dynamo than than drop the colour you can still play with it then i guess i don't know yeah but a hand dynamo costs a lot of energy to keep the screen working so i guess that isn't an option
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah true let's let's go for the hand dynamo then
or or do we or do we do uncurved and flat instead of
yeah it has to be curved and has to have that colour and a screen
yeah
s what what is special f oh yeah special form maybe that's nicer
but we don't have any buttons so do d uh make it a special colour then
yeah ma make it a special colour then
okay make it a special colour and then it look fancy so
yeah let's let's save it
yeah
let's do it like this i mean because it does not lose our identity of the product as we
yeah all your designs are uh pretty much
yeah but that but that's the fun part of it
alright
yeah what's the next uh phase
uh the agenda
by your humble p m 
oh f frustrated alright
yeah
drop yeah

yeah yeah
yeah that that's yeah i uh i sure did and it combines with product evaluation uh so
we all have to keep in mind what has changed now so what we have left on the because evaluation is based on the initial uh user requirements alright
let's make it big
um
well we evaluate uh the design with a seven point scale as following well the remote
controls according criteria blah blah blah true or false and then on a scale of seven points a
scale as we all know it um
well the criteria are based on the user requirements uh the trends from the marketing research and the marketing strategy of the company itself
um well they are in a word document which i will open now yeah i don't know it's open yet no
and we all have to uh agree on a certain level what's this
oh i don't know um
well the first point is the remote control matches the operating behaviour of the young user so that means the operating behaviour was using quite a lot of functions
how do you think about that
yeah the us u
it it it's it's mainly con mainly concentrating on a lot of functions in this question so do you think
yeah you can you can ma yeah you can make a lot of extended menus that's true i mean the the possibilities are almost unlimited to to build in menus in the screen
so on a scale from
one to seven what do you think
huh
two or three something like that well we have to choose one so uh what do you say i agree on two
yeah i uh i say two personally but
yeah well we have to evaluate i guess what we have now
yeah you say three and you you said al also three three okay well i say still two but it has
to be three then yeah i know so it's made bold but it's
nah it's not very clear on the sc maybe other colour yeah that's better
uh
yeah alright oh it doesn't have to be bold anymore
alright
yeah um well the remote control has wha

the remote control has irrelevant or less used functions for example audio settings and screen settings
yeah well yeah so it it's a very true point i mean it hides all those function
but i mean uh they're hidden in the screen if you don't want to use them you don't s you s just scroll over them and you place them
f i don't know where so that's very true i guess for our case
uh the second point it shows the relevant and most used functions power button
do we ha still have a power button well yeah the button's integrated huh
yeah we dropped it you j you just push it in for yeah just just push it in for th for three seconds or something and then yeah i don't know yeah um it shows the relevant and most used functions
yeah uh on the other uh on one side i would say yes and the other side i would say no
so it's i don't know
yeah
with the scroll butt yeah and then say channel and then
hmm
yeah
yeah
but but how do you change from volume to channel
no
no we have n we have no buttons left so the joystick was not an option
so so you hav so you you have to double click i mean for
i mean uh volume and three double click for the menu or something yeah
yeah yeah alright
but but ease of use was not very important may i remind you so that's yeah but that that's not a question uh the remote control shows the relevant and most used functions well i think it's pretty much in the middle
you have to search for them in in the in the s in the screen in the menu so
so maybe it's more like a f a five or
yeah five or six
five alright yeah
oh
yeah
yeah alright uh the the remote control makes use of technolog technological innovation like l c d  screen and speech recognition well yeah but we dropped the speech recognition but it has at least one innovation
i say two then
yeah but that that's not that's not this question uh thi uh that's the other question
this one
two yeah i think l c d 's more useful than speech what oh not the bold one
right okay it has a fancy look and feel by using fruit and vegetable prints primary colours
and sponge like material it should have been two questions i realise now because
sponge like material is dropped but the look and feel
yeah
the button has also colour yeah
yeah the one
mm mm
yeah we have single curve now and no and no material so maybe in the middle or something
yeah i mean it's
worth the yeah
yeah
yeah but then we would have to drop the screen oh red
yeah
yeah i like bold
uh the remote control displays the corporate logo
yeah you just have to draw it
yeah
but there's uh enough space for the corporate logo i mean if there's only one thing
yeah so i will say that is very true
yeah the remote control is easy to use well i would say skill uh i would say six or something i don't think it's easy to use or not so
yeah
yeah it it it has a nice screen but yeah
yeah well i i would say a five or a six
what do you say easy to use five or a six
so a six more
yeah uh i would go for the six too so

um well another question uh the remote control is durable i don't know if that's the correct word but uh
in use both battery as casing
yeah
true true and the casing is plastic
yeah if you don't drop it too much it's uh should last pretty long
yeah but uh i think rubber compared is better so i think a two is more appropriate
than
yeah logo okay i will go go for two
uh the last one the remote control's a good example for company's motto we put the fashion in electronics
uh turn around yeah but um
yeah
it's not
yeah true
so a four it's it g it g goes it's not the best we could do i guess but it all has to do with the budget because it's it's not the bad idea we had so
alright yeah
right
so if i understood it right we have to count these numbers
uh
yeah mm hmm oh
oh alright word document the yeah we have to count them
uh
yeah just add them and then uh divide them yeah
mm i all made it po i i all made it i all made it possible uh for a positive questions so we can count it i mean if you have reversed question you have to reverse the scale uh yes
yeah
thanks
oh easy question number four yeah
yeah
how hard is it
yeah just use oh there tho uh there's no n there's no num pads
it's a it's a bit uh
yeah i think you can just count them by a um let's move over three plus one four nine
uh yeah are you here eleven fifteen
sixteen yeah
no sixteen uh sixteen plus six twenty two
twenty two yeah tw
twenty twenty eight
twen uh okay
by nine that's uh three uh or le less than a three
yeah twenty eight
di divided by nine makes three point one one one one one one one
yeah

yeah but there are no negative questions i guess good example durable use easy
to use this is good fancy look and feel that's good technology
innovation was good because of a marketing uh requirement re relevant most used function and hides
these functions that was also a good thing
and then matches the opera of the user was also a good thing so it were all positive questions by uh by purpose so
yes so the it tells us something yes becau but the picture would be a lot different if we didn't have to drop those uh those things i guess
yeah nah it it's it's better than average but
yeah so th
yeah
no the colour and the screen
yeah we we have to maybe if we have to redesign it on this
with some casing around it yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
oh yeah
yeah
do we have to do other things
or just redesign

alright
yeah so you made a start right
yeah
alright
the the target group has a weak spot for fruit and vegetables like primary colours spongy shape the playfulness we decided to use kinetic energy as a power sour
okay
that's conceptual yes
mm
how many pages
alright y you have you have done the first two
okay and and the look and feel is
yeah
the items we had to drop
where did we start with price twenty six and a half
or not
or twenty six something like that
this
speckles
uh
yeah
yeah some some big dots
yeah
 
we have the original balance sheet or yeah
woah just cut
control z 
yeah yeah
just dual screen
very nice
yeah y y you you you push the button or something or
lot of options
yeah the r  and another r  it's called the real remote right
maybe maybe it c it can say that the real remote
yeah welcome
yeah yeah
you can copy and paste the picture if you want
yeah
what is that look more looks more like a campfire
yeah
yeah
type in your report
i don't see any new messages so
hmm luckily yeah
what time do we have to deliver the report four o'clock or
or before that
just compare uh
no it's on the on the beamer i guess
yeah strange
this something what's projection from behind i guess
yeah it it's a beamer but then with a within a mirror yeah so it looks like a big screen but in fact it isn't
well it's it's single single curved
th this is flat yeah
but it's it's better to have in the front this kind of shape because it looks nice
i mean you see more of this than of that
yeah more like that

it's not very uh ideal
do like this
yeah
what's this
ooh
but i don't see a detector over there
i thought it was a kind of thing to put it on and then draw right lines or something

yeah or just messed it up
yeah
yeah but it wasn't good
yeah it it has to touch the corners i guess but th this one wasn't good because if i was drawing here i drew a line and then it came over here

oh
ooh
yeah yeah it's it's okay it's working again
it's better than before
yeah
yeah that's improved uh pretty much
yeah
yeah but it's better it's better
mm
no it's better than it was i guess
silly
yeah works pretty well five minutes before the meeting's over and then we have to present
alright
so it after the after after these five minutes you have to
alright after after that five minutes you have ten minutes to finish it or alright and we uh
right chill
huh
uh yeah
next slide
yeah how do you do it
alright
yeah
yeah
and we move more to to working together as team because at first you you make your individual contribution
and then come here and you have no idea what the others have to make and then finally you have some idea okay this
is gonna w this is what we gonna make together and okay i will arrange this and you will arrange that and you have
a k a kind of idea what you can expect on the next half hour when you have to work on your own so
the process i mean the interaction between us became better and better i guess
yeah especially if f f if you see uh you se you saw the largest difference from the first to the second meeting i guess

yeah
yeah
li limiteded afterwards but
if if you don't take that into account there's plenty of room for creativ creativity also not only the drawing and the the making of the thing itself but also in explaining it to the other people by means of uh
the the board and uh powerpoint and word and stuff like that
mm uh i think in in essence
the digital pen is better than the smartboard because it it it just works better i mean uh uh i've made
yeah uh i've made several notes just to test it and and just put the pen in into
it and then it came onto my screen and it looked perfectly so it it's better a better device than
uh
than the screen but the screen is useful in essence but it doesn't work that well

yeah
yep
warning finish meeting now
well it it's use especially useful i guess to to evaluate designs and graph graphical stuff
and and
the screen and stuff like that
yeah
yeah
yeah but it it's useful to to show something to to an a small audience and then to
yeah these these kind of screens this size are useful to discuss things so
yes check your email
you also
right
yes boss
well see you soon yeah
you all saw the newsflash or you got the same message
yeah sorry
yeah
yeah i received an email so i thought i i can't mail you so i thought i'd just drop it in the folder but
is it unlocked
woah i uh kind of opened it
uh
okay
'kay everybody ready
no no no yes yes yes
okay
'kay can we get started or is there some pressing issue
oh no pressing did you plug in the power cable when you come back
yeah that's difficult yeah


yeah
format save
yeah
oh yeah sure you have playstation also
huh
okay so there we are again
yeah
okay this is the agenda um we have three presentations i heard
yeah really so who wants to start
yeah uh this is you
'kay
yeah
often
next generation does
n not used anymore
yeah
yeah
not by mail i receiv the mail but you don't so
that's in the presentation so
uh below i believe yeah below forty
mm hmm
our current customers are in the age group forty plus and the new product should reach new markets which is the customers below forty
that's in a newsflash

yeah
but it also needs to have corporate identity
present and the colours
so we can't change much of that
mm hmm
mm hmm yeah
yeah
okay
'kay
it's open already so you can use to
find yours
f  five
go jurgen you pressed alt f  four
oh great
yeah uh maybe you can do it from your computer so talk us through it
yeah
that's nice
f  five yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah
the mm yeah
yeah
mm hmm
yeah so n it's very easy now yeah it's okay
okay
yeah
yeah so maybe you can hide them or something
yeah you make a screen menu or something
mm hmm
yeah and the other oth other uh functionality is the screen what does the screen do
yeah it's low power
so what does the screen do they said they needed it but what does it do what do they want with the screen
yeah that's what we make it up so but what did the marketing
no
yeah okay it's handy with no predefined uh
we're back online
okay
mm hmm content and form
yeah that was the end okay
uh which one is it technical functions
this one
functional requirements
no
you didn't put it in or
it's not really english
uh kick off oh working design i got it
here you go
just uh press uh yeah yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm

mm
design yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah decoder
blank yeah okay
work harder
yeah
uh
'kay um for those that didn't see yet um the basic new requirements
of the management were no teletext only for t v  uh it
should be designed for a use g uh group below forty but i don't think it's w wrong if we can
uh target the current customer group as well
and uh the corporate identity should be clear in the design of the remote control
and we have to decide on the functions and on the let's see what was it uh the target group we have to make be clear what that is
yeah users
yeah so i think it's easy but
yeah it's below forty so we can decide where to
okay
so below forty is okay but we need an lower level which
to s uh focus so is it from sixteen to forty is it from twenty to
forty is it from thirty yeah 'kay
yeah
mm hmm
design mm
mm hmm
and maybe y
yeah
yeah yeah
so is you should have a menu for all the the functions you don't use regular and which are
yeah aye yeah
shall i uh
yeah it's okay
no it doesn't have line control so
yeah we get the
the remote yeah
basic
is on top
which should be easy easily reached with the thumb
t i s should said right because yeah
mm hmm
do the also with the thumb so it should be a little bit longer so that you can put your uh thumb also reach the middle or you should screen at the bottom and then you can see it very clearly
you you need to be able to hold it so
yeah
yeah okay that's true layout that's for the

i can't help it
yeah
man
yeah okay


you want the normal piece of paper and you have a pen
yeah
mm hmm
uh and the for flipping up and down
yeah
and left to right
and those can also be used for the menu
yeah
yeah okay but this is function so if you can use them for multiple things
for the menu yeah
mm hmm
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah but that depends on where you put the screen but it's essential that there is a screen
yeah
and for the speech uh recognition part if we want to incorporate that we need a microphone
yeah this would be uh
no that's not s sure so uh we need a display
yeah
yeah they're used to it
mm hmm

yeah but then it's possible that you cover it with your hand so
i think that top is the best option
yeah okay
depends on the sensitivity of the microphone but i think that's okay
volume
up
channel up and down and the control of the advanced options
so maybe it we should decide what advanced options we want to put in the l c d  screen
yeah so sounds
yeah and they're
they're not used often so

yeah just
yeah sounds
yeah
of course i'm just a secretary
coffee
treble bass
uh
pitch i believe yeah
yeah
yeah and mono stereo
mm and also the tuning part
yeah programming so channel programming
mm yeah
contrast yeah
mm no
uh so contrast
bright
uh
and the others were in your presentation right so i can just copy those
okay it's easy
yeah the button options and the l c d  options
indeed yeah
yeah you have basically a button menu which you can use directly uh according to
the old principle and the l c d  options are activated by some some software options
thats communicates with the infrared uh decoder yeah
so you
you have an additional processor and and software part
compared to o
mm hmm
l  s
yeah
colour yeah i i call it contrast yeah i make it c colour
yeah
yeah and automatically um
mm hmm

yeah so i've g channel program is autoseek
uh name a channel or
oh they get automatic names okay
yeah
yeah but can you also say i want f uh veronica on the channel number uh five or
yeah yeah
how do you call that
channels yeah
ninety nine or something yeah
s swap channels
can i call it that
swap's good option okay uh other functions
mm hmm okay
well that's 's up to uh mister user interface designer
also that's you're
yeah but also which buttons you have to press to get a certain result
and the working design was to specify how ph the physical interation between the components was as i believe

no i don't think so but i think the communication with the television is difficult but that's not our part we don't have to design a protocol so

no that's the
yeah
so but
um
the user interface designer can design a menu
for all these function i put them on the
yeah yeah i can i'll just try to reorganise uh things um
so you design the basic function menu for the l c d  screen
uh um
i think th i think the yeah the layout of the screen and i think you can concentrate more on the button placement and the placement of the uh screen itself on the
no i d i think that's more in
yeah
okay so he's layout and you're function
form function okay
yeah
i think i that's your department yes because w he already knows what
yeah
but we're not allowed
yeah
yeah
yeah and also make clear which buttons to press to get certain result because that's always the difficulty every device has its own
menu okay yeah
mm
back yeah
yeah but they're incorporated up and down is
smart
put it on top
mm hmm
well
but that's uh j jurgen's department
you just make the layout you do we do the extra two buttons or not
yeah
yeah okay that's true
and to okay and back also
and of course the four arrows
but those are still y doubly used both the l c d 
yeah
menu button access the menu in the l c d  screen
you can navigate
but you can also navigate the channels and the volume
those are both both yeah
oh five minutes
light uh
yeah sure okay um
anything else
i've
volume
well we have those buttons we use all four
yeah okay go ahead
yeah that was already decided
okay that's what we decided earlier on right okay so yeah i wanna
close down i have to sorry it's not because i don't like you but yh we have lunch break
and then we can work for thirty minutes and i have to write very fast to make the minich min
minutes and then uh we'll see
i don't know
nobody told me
no i th believe there's first lunch break
yeah or you can just
yeah
'kay

i think you can put uh the laptop back in the room and
'kay
yeah it's a lot of pressure
that's okay
oh yeah

i don't know if it works but it should be saved
yeah it's uh
should be here smart board
don't know if you can use it but
yeah i try to organise it by these three
yeah yeah yeah
i don't really mind i just put the minutes here and we'll see
yeah that's in the functional design uh folder
yeah yeah that's just basically what i just showed
yeah yeah i got it by yeah
i'm gonna get kicked if i don't do it so
make me proud
yeah
i believe so
just ask
hello
'kay
newsflash d did i miss something
okay
no
mm
i think you have to uh change your desktop uh
size
computer is uh not functioning
uh display
and then uh settings
mm i'm not sure i
no


okay
format
i made uh uh my own map
it's a
yeah
yeah
yeah wa wa you actually
yeah
but it it's not clear what you have to to to type uh type in your presentation
yeah
really
okay
yeah i was wondering uh
but you you've got more information than uh
but where did you get uh that information
okay yeah
yeah
okay
mm
it's
f  five
okay
oh
what is this oh no
how do i uh
no no no i pressed the mouse button

yeah okay
okay um if you all go stand around uh
computer
um
no
okay
i uh had uh two examples um this one is the the yeah the advanced one with
a lot of options and functions and buttons this the easy one i think we have to to combine them
and uh yeah merge the best functions of all examples
um but yeah the the age is uh under forty so we
okay so so we have the option for more functions um yeah
yeah
uh yeah this this one we can remove for kids it's just only for adults so uh we can uh use some advanced options but
yeah but i prefer we we uh use the the basic options uh yeah we have to to make them very easy so
for just uh zapping around the channels you can just push one button but if you want to to use your your video recorder
or something else you should use use an uh an advanced option
okay one device okay i didn't see okay and i also uh yeah w yeah we have to make it fashionable like you uh said uh before
uh yeah the basic functions um yeah only use a extra function if they are really needed
yeah
yeah
yeah
did i uh did i break it
for for the advanced functions i think
like searching for channels and
yeah
okay that's uh i'm al i'm almost finished so
um the we have to to to watch out for the i if we make it f very fashionable it it the functional
functionality will go down so we have to make uh a compromise between functionality and fashional
fashionable yeah content and form now that that was uh was
the end yes

yeah
okay shou should we make a list of the of all the functions we want uh
yeah
but uh it's it's also for children or just uh
okay
okay
yeah we we have to
and if we have a larger public we have uh yeah more options to to uh sell our product
yeah that's that's why uh i wanted to to make yeah two uh different uh yeah groups of
functions the the simple functions for for the the whole public and the the advanced options for the younger people
yeah who are more yeah experienced with uh
na
i w i should uh put uh the the yeah the extra advanced options on the onto the onscreen display
yeah
yeah
yeah l left top or right uh top
yeah right
okay

yeah but if you are using the the normal functions the the basic functions you normally press them on the u yeah
yeah

you broke it
yeah yeah and volume control
yeah
yeah
and do we need a a logo on our uh remote control or
on the left uh top yeah
okay
yeah may maybe because you're
yeah okay but only for the basic functi if you're going to use the advanced option you're going to press the the menu button and then yeah
yeah
okay the yeah that's possible
yeah okay
okay we put it on top
yeah
yeah

yeah if we
yeah it it's just a remote control so
yeah
television uh itself uh
mm
we we could make an option for it but uh you can disable s
yeah
but uh the the television itself has also the the options brightness and uh screen colour etcetera so yeah

okay
yeah
no that's
okay
on the uh yeah can you i make a a map with with all the yeah 'cause it's now there are lots and lots of documents
and
the the layout of the remote control
isn't that more the the u uh the user interface part
yeah
but do i have to to uh to yeah to make the the menu layout also or
are you going to do that yeah i i'm going to make yeah o okay
yeah

yeah
okay y you you are going to make a list of what functions are uh are going to to be on the the screen the menu screen and i'm going to make a a nice menu uh with with pages and yeah
yeah
yeah w we
uh i think we have to to group to make two groups um the one group for the for the display and one group for the basic functions and
yeah okay but we we have a m yeah but maybe that's that's not uh yeah if you're if
you're z zapping uh with your uh yeah remote control you can press the the menu button and
then you are suddenly into the the yeah the display
yeah
yeah j just just group group the yeah we make these the advanced functions and these the basic functions so we make a yeah a line between them
f oh yeah okay yeah we swap uh okay
yeah so we make it a
okay
uh
yeah so we have a a menu button and a s
okay okay and back button
yeah i'm i'm not s clear about uh the the extra two buttons we have a menu button and
that's the the one with the yeah okay
okay
okay so that that's not uh yeah that those are
multifunctional
yeah
yeah
yeah
no
yeah
so maybe make one uh one okay button and and one navigation button
yeah the with with the the channel and the volume uh yeah m a multifunctional navigation button
yeah okay yeah

but do we have to write uh to write down uh the our stuff now or first lunchbreak because i
i've everything in my head now so
okay yeah
'kay
yeah
yes sir
oh no no
okay
and uh we have to make uh some maps with uh with the all the the data we uh gathered
it's it's just my own map so i put everything into the
but you got some extra information uh
okay
but where do you did you get the newsflash
you're the only one uh okay
okay
yeah

it's
i don't know i didn't see it yet i think
hey what's wrong with my computer
huh
what the
not really sorry
okay where do i find this i'm not so g display huh
appearance
no what was it about
yeah my computer is not functioning properly
yeah yeah no but my screen is reduced in size
yeah
feedback
okay
this is dreadful
no not this but the task yeah no that's okay no i just flapped it closed it took it here and then this happened
ah uh where was it in settings
okay alright thank you do you guys like your tasks
i spent a lot of time thinking about what i was gonna do and then a couple of minutes before this i get my function you know the information that i need so frustrating so
yeah
yeah exactly this presentation is mainly based on my own ideas 'cause i hadn't time to intergrate tha the information yet so
really annoying
yeah
ts
so they do need to be in the
alright
by the way my t v  doesn't have an equ equaliser but okay
no alright
by the way where did you guys get that newsflash from i didn't get anything
alright
do we have uh yeah
alright

it's th that's the self destruct button
alright
mm hmm
and we do have to integrate the screen and the the speech alright
mm hmm
yeah
alright
ah look
we have your uh oh never mind
okay well my presentation is a bit uh sucky
yeah a little bit uh no
no no

yeah i think that would be it then
i have no idea
that w let me check
i know
yeah
alright how do i uh skip pages
the keys yeah alright um yeah well i was working on this before
i got my information so i was just working off the top of my head and using my colin common knowledge about
uh remote controls
and well the info on the website which came too late um so
i didn't really know what kind of functions we had to put into it yet so uh
uh this is basically an overview of what we discussed in our last uh meeting those were
my uh starting points
uh i was working on a s yeah on a schedule and i was supposed to do it
like this but um yeah then uh the information
came and it was kind of exact with all the steps in the remote control that i had to follow so i was trying to
organise them for myself and then make the the design a the actual design
but i never came around to do that so i'm not really sure what i'm supposed to say about
it
i mean everything speaks for itself i guess mean you press a button um the it tru
goes it sends a signal to a chip which uh translates it into infrared signal
of certin spatial frequencies and uh or temporal fr frequencies actually
and then uh through a uh transformer it the signal gets boosted
and then sent to the to the receiver on the t v  and the t v  will
translate it into a function um
yeah well this was
actually all i got around to do i mean i dunno if i'm too slow for this stuff but uh
yeah whatever
yeah so what we might wanna do is uh yeah cust i have customised the screen functions
if you know what i mean the uh younger users are more acquainted with
these kind of machines so they can use more advanced functions but maybe elderly people don't
understand it so well so they need a simpler remote and yeah that you can choose what the
design displays or wha whatever
yeah
experienced yeah
the remote
right top
yeah definitely
and might be easier huh
yeah i
yeah exactly i thought but this is really your department that we need just the functional display and four cursors
and
yeah okay
yeah
mm hmm
why did we wanna put the display in the bottom
okay
because yeah if you use the functions your hand will block the display
normal for logical t
yeah
on once it's on it's on you don't need the power button
yeah
maybe on the top or even on the side
true
but if you uh if you hold the ma the remote like this if you put it on the top on the side i dunno should be able to work never mind
can we leave this up to you
yeah so we we needed to integrate the sound and uh
and image options right like uh bass uh so we need kind of an equaliser if you
yeah treble middl middle bass or something
ah as

yes please
the mono stereo option and there there was something else also and then pitch
the fr yeah the frequency of the tones yeah
yeah isn't that that depends on the on the signal of the of what program you're watching
and yeah in the functionality of the
no no of the remote uh do do we want uh the buttons to make sound when you press them as a confirmation or whatever you know i dunno
under the a yeah advanced option menu you can put those things
yeah
but so we have we have t v  options which is all this the sound sound and image and you have in that uh the indeed the remote control options so we need two menus kind of thing
uh huh
alright
help
working design doch
he only has to figure out how it has to look and how
to use
yeah okay but
you did your homework but um yeah okay
no no it should be able to do any remote
no
thank god
uh all the functional uh aspects of the remote i think are in my department i
have to know what it has to do so if you wanna you know the changing the channels kind of s
thing is i have to integrate that in the design
yeah
i think that's a that's a good separation
mm
yeah we have to kind of work together if if i make the the the yeah the menu like i have to state which function has to be in the menu and then you have to decide it's in a in a way that b is user friendly
yeah
i think yeah
mm hmm
yeah
you wanna separate uh
i think you should it's easier if you put too many functions in one button it gets confusing
no
hey is it interesting for users if we put led lights under the buttons so that if you uh press on the menu function that only the buttons that are used for the menu are ligh li light up
n
yeah and then it's also easier to integrate several functions in one button
i think not
yeah keep it optional 'cause maybe you can you know go left to right and up and down in a in one menu
the pr the problem with the okay button in the middle is sorry
sorry uh is uh if you're pressing up and down you can easily press the okay once you when you're not already at your choice
you wanna close down huh
that's okay
already
alright how m how long is the lunchbreak
okay
mm
this is
yeah
sorry for my uh not finished presentation uh
bring it on
alright
i'll try to so first we have a lunchbreak now
alright
mm hmm i dunno where she
yeah i i just saw it one minute ago when i uh
yeah
yeah pretty much
mm
yeah that's my presentation
mm oh right

ooh
well
alright

huh

you read the newsflash
hmm

what
hmm
alt delete
so it doesn't draw the attention away
yeah
yeah
yeah i i had a whole idea and then just was typing it and then oh i have to do that so switch
mm
by your humble p m 


yeah that's fine
we have to start it right away
functional yeah functional requirements
alright
i'm gonna talk about functional requirements um
well uh some research has be done uh has been done uh observing of one hundred uh subjects in the usability lab using a remote control uh and they also filled in a questionnaire
the findings were um well you can see them for yourself they disliked the look and feel of current remotes controls
users think they're ugly um they do not match the the operating behaviour
of the users so they they d they don't match what they want to have on it
um they are often lost somewhere in the room um it takes too much time to learn how to
use a new remote control and they're bad for r s i  i don't
know uh how a user can reach that but okay
um there is also uh was also some research on uh the most relevant
and and and irrelevant uh f functions uh most irrelevant and less used were audio
settings mono stereo uh pitch bass um screen settings for brightness and colour
and stuff like that um but they are used i mean the
yeah they do need to be on the on the remote control i mean if you can't control the the sound settings i mean if you dislike a very uh loud bass or something you you need to change that so um yeah we have to we c we c
yeah i mean w we can't my my t v  has but we we can leave them uh
away uh most relevant uh most used functions uh they speak for themselves i guess uh power
button uh channel volume selection uh teletext but we can skip that because
i saw the newsflash and teletext is so outdated that it it's i should not be used uh any more
in the future so forget this one uh channel settings so for programming uh your channels
in in the right order
yeah on on the project uh
no so it's a text file n in the project folder so teletext can be skipped
um there was some research on new features in a remote control uh about an l c d  screen uh
and speech recognition well we got an update for the for the audience
or the the the targeted group so it's above forty i guess
the new product or below because that's pretty relevant
i thought i read a
yeah
below okay well that's that's in the newsfla okay that's a good to know
um because you see see a clear distinction between the age groups concerning the features i mean uh
above forty people are not so interested uh not so interested in a screen or speech recognition
uh but below that age they uh they pretty much are so i think we can build that in
um
yeah well we can skip this part as well because i thought i read above forty so we could skip the features but we just have to build them in because uh they find it very interesting
um well we have to keep all the classic functions but make the buttons as user friendly as possible
um and and also there's so not only the design of the bus uh buttons but o
how you can push them and stuff like that so the physical uh aspect of it um
and i think and certainly for for the for the lower age groups uh nice design which uh does not make the remote
control in your room it's it's actually a part of your interior of of your design in your room
so it's the people can say well what's that well that's my remote control so it's d it has to look nice
and feel nice and and have all the functions that uh
yeah so the the logo has to be uh present yeah and the colours as well
yeah so but i i don't think that's that's a problem because the thing has to have a colour anyway and
most of the times there is a brand present on it so i think that's not gonna gonna affect it very uh very much
well that are the the consequences uh on a marketing uh part
yes

yeah just yeah
sure
yeah alright
yeah
yeah
yeah and and and marketing research stated that that that kind of users are not afraid of of a lot of functions so not not too much but yeah
and the speech recognition yeah
yeah from age of sixteen so yeah
mm
yeah but uh the the newsflash also stated that it should control only one device only your television so w
so there are not extra options in this case but uh
yeah
yeah
yeah well what what we can do with the screen is is all the the configuration options you can put that in the screen and
the and the yeah screen menu to to to uh to do that and then the basic function
just on the device itself so it looks very simple and all the advanced features are hidden in the screen uh with a clear
menu
uh what are wh
what
yeah well it yeah it didn't it didn't say what they want to do with the screen well i my guess is it's it's pretty handy for advanced uh advanced functions
yeah searching for channels programming them
yeah
yeah

well you can improvise right
so we we can go for
so we can go for the look and feel of the the left example and then a screen on top of it
yeah


design yeah
okay
yeah frequency yeah
yeah


yeah we want to incorporate in uh into it
mm
group of users or because it says below forty i mean i guess that's that's the tar yeah uh or male and female
uh six the marketing research started on s on the age of sixteen sixteen to twenty five twenty five to thirty five thirty five to forty five something like that so um
how do you mean
uh sixteen to forty well i i guess people of sixteen are are quite used to technology so they they adapt to it pretty soon i guess
yeah
but uh all incorporated in the screen or or just on the remote itself
yeah like like you have a visual of the of the brightness with with a kind of sliding bar and a bus and and stuff like that for sound and and vis and and visuals
uh you can make a if you make a drawing uh
uh
uh black's okay
and draw it very big oh yeah
yeah

yeah well this is basically uh it's alright the remote um well usually the power button is on top i guess
yeah so it should fit right in into your hand
right right i most people are right handed so maybe left handed special addition but okay if you put it like like here or something i dunno
um then you could put a screen like on a mobile phone also on top i guess
okay so y yeah you have you have it in your hand and the screen is below and the buttons are in the middle okay for example if you put the screen here it's more about the functions now than the than the layout
doesn't work too well it's uh it's bent
yeah
right
okay you get it uh for example if y if you put all the

right
yeah
maybe this kind of works
like if you have
like uh ten buttons for for all the for all the channels um and here one for for
yeah that that usually uh like here here here here so you have up and down for the for the channels and left and right for the volume uh
yeah
yeah
and you you have most of the time you have one button in the middle it says menu and then
if you press it you the screen gets activated and then you can use these buttons to scroll up and down
and left and right to go into functon and then just mo most of the time this menu button
is also like okay to to confirm a a kind of action so you scroll into it okay
you select a function like v like uh bass
you just adjust it with these two buttons then okay to confirm and then uh
on on each on each screen there's there should be an option to go back to a to a upper level
and then finally say okay exit or or one button to exit it
uh in one time i dunno that's not really my department that's more your uh your department to to uh to
yeah but it should be if the screen is here then the logo should be like on on top yeah i mean it's uh
yeah
yeah i mean the position of the screen is also more essential than i mean we we look where we have space left and then put the logo over there but um
yeah so it should be i mean if you have it in your hand here should be on top somewhere maybe i mean i
that's not sure but it's
yeah i mean a screen on top looks more lo logical to me also because people use m
mobile phones and they also have the screen on top so you you just have to reach a little
bit for the power button i mean if you grab it but most most
of the times if a if if a t v 's on standby people just press a channel to put it on so we put this on top
and then make the corporate logo
like over here r r  and j and the microphone i mean it can be very small if you look at your mobile phones are some stripes little little holes
yeah maybe on the side i mean if the if the microphone is good
yeah okay so on the on the top is better
yeah
yeah it doesn't matter that much so but um the screen is on top which functions did we have left
i mean this is basically numbers volume uh channel up and down screen is over there
yeah
yeah that's uh that's a good one
yeah
sound
yeah equaliser so if you have sound
but not too advanced i mean most t v s use only treble and bass
yeah it's uh pretty hard to write mm okay but you have sound
yeah just oh y you have digital uh better write it down over there yeah so you have sound
yeah uh yeah sound and then within sound i guess treble and bass
yeah also
pitch yeah but pitch isn't that yeah that's the the height of the tone
yeah okay wh why would you use that if people like talk like uh
yeah
programming part
uh so we have sound yeah channel programming
mm i think it g it gets annoying i mean most mobile phones used that in the beginning but
yeah
yeah but people don't want to sit on their knees on their knees in front of their television with only three buttons then it's very hard to y yeah contrast and brightness
yeah those are the most used i guess if you look at your monitor
well yeah well i guess that these were the only ones i guess
yeah i will look it up

yeah with the chip and then i mean
uh yeah well yeah we have power button whether that's
present channel volume selection present uh numbers present yeah a audio settings mono stereo
pitch bass treble screen settings brightness and colour
yeah con contrast is
yeah okay colour and brightness um and what you say channel settings or channel programming
so you you have an option to to start scanning all the frequencies and when it encounters
one well it shows on your t v  and then you can um
uh and then you can select uh a number in your remote on which you want to save it
yeah autoseek
well most t v s automatically display the name which they get through the cable
yeah so you only have to choose the position on your
it only has to match the the channel frequency on your t v  with with the with the position on your t v  and and so your remote
if you already programmed it if you want to move it yeah that should be possible too yeah how do you call that mm
wait you you should be able to to browse through a list or something which w displays
all the all the values all the channels which are possible i mean like one to f thirty
of or ninety or whatever just browse through it and then um in some kind of way
see if it if it if it is programmed
yeah swap channels
so you most of the time if you if you swap it
s uh let's say for example you have uh r t l  five on on channel five and
veronica on channel eight and you want to move veronica to channel five um most of the times you
override the previous uh the previous one
yeah it's it's pretty uh yeah i mean you have to look on on the menu
on the t v 
yeah
or or is it too hard to to ju to just do it all on your remote to programme the channels
uh
yeah
no
that's true that's true
yeah so we have a figure a figure out a way to to do that easily i mean th the autoseek is is not a problem
i mean you uh you uh current channel and then then it just says uh on which number do you want to save this and you
just press a number on your remote and then say confirm okay and then it's it's saved it's easier
it's it's it's harder to if you have already programmed it to to swap so we have to think of something
for that
yeah k kind of structure into layers
so
and and the layout of of the thing itself
maybe more on
okay
yeah yeah i guess so
yeah

yeah
with with some l with some layers in it so some menus
yeah
yeah well i guess this this button the the the okay menu okay or you can incorporate two uh difference uh different buttons uh like uh for your mobile phone
um so this is only for to get in the menu or to exit it and then one to
confirm and one to go one step back so it's like the the save button on your your
mobile phone if you have a nokia or like that or the or the no button to go one step back you it's only two
extra buttons but if it if it's very clear that they are for the screen
yeah because this this is used for both
into your screen okay so you l should leave the menu button out of here and and just put it under the screen the screen
yeah
but we should place the screen on top right
yeah
yeah you just you just find out and
yeah
yeah yeah or confirm and back whatever
yeah
should we save this picture or or you know what it looks like
yeah that that just to to activate the screen so
and then with these buttons woa y you navigate
yeah
l l litten up yeah
that's very good idea
alright yeah that's a good idea because then it becomes clear which buttons are active now which you can use
yeah
so
those buttons are are lit up but just one thing should we use those two them or only this to to scroll and then use the two functional buttons to confirm to go into something
oh no we have to use this to adjust some some bars
yeah and maybe we should use this also as an okay button still and then just only a back button
yeah
yeah
and one back
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
we have to ask
yes

yeah
time pressure

yeah we'll kick your ass later no uh
aye
y you saved it does it save automatically in the project folder or
okay we'll see just put back my laptop
alright yeah you can open it with the picture preview or stuff like that



internet
alright

well i'll uh start just with another presentation so then we can uh look at th at the agenda uh for this meeting
okay
i've put some uh new things in the in the map
uh oh
this is it
i don't know the shortcut so ah f  five well our functional design meeting that's the stage we're in and you also ha all three of you have uh prepared something about it
well um in we'll uh just have a look at the at the notes from the previous meeting what we uh thought we had dec decided but uh
uh then we'll uh look at uh the three uh presentations uh from you
i think you have prepared uh all three uh um we'll look at th the new project requirements we uh i dunno y you also have uh received that mail the new project requirements from our bosses
oh i've received a mail with uh some additional requirements and i'll have a look if well i think we should show them before your presentations because it's not really uh
smart uh to uh to include some things uh we can't because of the new requirements well um then we can make some decisions about our remote control functions we have to deb we have to decide it in this meeting what our function will be
and then uh we can discuss uh some more closely uh
uh yeah i think so well uh the closing uh we'll not uh look at it yet
um now i'll look at show this board
um
well uh notes first meeting
now
i gave a disc a a presentation uh we familiarised ourself with the boards and then we discussed some first ideas so
we said that uh
we have to merge the strong points from our uh competitors and uh look at their uh remote controls
we should make it uh compatible with our new d v d  and other releases we have our technical releases
uh not too many one buttons one recognisable button in the middle where you do the most important functions with
and um well they can have two functions because uh you have a d v d  and a television
um the design has to fit the hand be original but also be familiar
it's uh one of our ideas yeah well that wa it's just thirty minutes ago so it's not quite uh
but well i have to do it the materials uh well should be hard plastic with rubber from and uh well the labelling
of the buttons should be indestructible
it should be uh recognisable at all times yes well fronts were to be just like mobile telephones
and uh the technical aspects um and also labelling of the buttons the functions should be universal standards well that's just uh some ideas from the first meeting it's quite logical al all of it
um now the new project requirements i'll just show them i got this mail
from uh our bosses well teletext goes out we will not use teletext
maybe a new sort of thing but n but not teletext well
the second is a bit
sh pity because we just said we wanted to d include the d v d  and they don't want it because of our time we have for this project
so that's a shame because uh especially for the third requirement we want to reach people under the thirty years
because uh we don't have those customers a lot at th at this point um well it's a bit pity because it's just those people want to have uh one remote control for all those technical devices they can uh reach it
yeah
well and uh our corporate image should stay rec recognisable in our products so uh we have to uh
use uh maybe a slogan maybe a colour and um yeah well uh
on our remote controls the design has to be uh well as we already said a actually uh familiar uh
not only just uh the shape but also our company
yeah yeah yeah
okay
yes i i uh noted uh our uh slogan that we have our company it's uh we mm put the fashion in electronics
so maybe that's a slogan we can put uh somewhere on our remote control or something alright then um
we're going to uh have three presentations you want to start oh
you have to start i didn't see anything about uh who had to start well s then start
okay well uh
you already uh opened uh powerpoint
yeah
mm hmm

yeah

well
it should actually uh it should actually be loose from the television because it can also be used for other televisions so if you deliver
a small uh click on device that you can put on your television that bleeps to your remote
control everyone can use it no you can click it on your television
yeah in another room yeah well yes
yeah
well we'll have a look at it yeah
yep
well there sh should always be a menu but it c can be very short
yes okay
well we are a design team we can say to some uh writer uh make a manual point
so
well we'll have a look um yes
yep
well
well with twelve euro fifty as production cost we can't uh afford an l c d  uh
yeah
well yeah well uh it's your your task to uh look into the costs uh of those uh nigh i know
it's not yet a standard uh development uh those so
we sh
yeah absolutely
yep

'kay
alright
yes
well you i c i can uh still see your presentation
it's in the well uh next um i dunno who is next you uh got uh
yes well go ahead

yip
f  five
f  five


click
yep



yeah
so it is also why we have to have a button that says uh i'm now busy with a d v d  uh if we had done that and a button for t v  so

well but but if you have um the most used buttons all in one place
and you keep making the same um well moves but if y if you would put it at a different place
then you have to move your hands and that's on of the things about r s i 
no but the most important buttons m maybe you can just put them a bit apart so you would
reject r  r s i  r s i 
yes i've saw that on m on mi mobile telephones they also have uh those buttons

well it it's
well also i if someone puts picks up his uh remote
yeah if someone puts up i uh picks up his remote and he picks up it he he touches the side then he's a already on the next channel that's very irritating i think well no
yep
mm hmm
that's your part of the job
yep
okay well we understand we understand oh right no
nice
then uh mike can uh give the third presentation
how late is did we start his presentation uh
wha yeah
well then we have still the time so but we do have to come to a decision right later on
so
oh yeah
uh
okay yeah well
mm hmm
yeah
yeah
i like user centred yeah
we also do that
yeah

mm hmm
well absolutely but i th they all have to have something about um the recognition from our company so we cannot just uh
make someone w
no but that's th the side they look uh look at is the front so if y if you make a a front with just a a tiger on it then uh our recognition is totally gone
yeah we must yeah well and and
yes
'kay
yeah yeah yeah or the th the the lowest part of the remote isn't changed by the front those kind of things yes okay
mm hmm
yeah
alright
yeah
well what if we um i at i at home have a remote that has um the most familiar
uh buttons on the top and the bottom side of the front has a little
clip a f a little uh you can click away and then you have f much more functions that most
people don't use but s some do do
well but because you say they their features are important they want m um a lot but not
yeah
competitors

yeah well maybe w we could uh s on um some uh calculators
you have lo those little little l c d  th that you can click on or something or that you can click uh out uh of
the remote and if if that's gives you a little bit of sta status information yeah
those kind of things uh because you also have those uh those program recognition for your v  v c r s
and uh well if y if your remote picks that up also you they can display which programme you're currently watching
yeah
for example
it it could be such a little uh th that you can click in and out and you and you have it
yeah
well maybe
yeah yeah
r d s s or something
well i think it's you got it just means it's a script that's uh keeps it uh rolling and it's not uh that's five minutes off uh implementing time i think uh
yeah
no
uh well i think so yes um
we're g no but we're we'll have to look into that
um we can use this board again i think uh we can put some um decisions about um the controls we want th the issue where is my presentation uh

uh
well
i mean we're all here now i think these i've already given you so we have to decide on the different remote control functions
so we want to have a small l c d  screen that's special
yes
yeah


that thing is terrible
uh
well
well i th i think mike mike has a point because um when when uh when i use a remote i l i hate the buttons but buttons at the at the bottom so and and i i like to use the ones
on the top so when i u when i have to have an l c d  s scr window
yes but we we we we don't want that we don't want them to look like a calculator we want to look it like our original but familiar
yea
maybe a bic uh better uh white uh we white
width uh format yeah format line width width
yeah
it's a bit off well
well uh let's uh talk about that later uh
it's special pen
yeah no
i think it should be at the button bottom
bottom the l c d 
yeah
well but uh what what if we we first decide the different functions and then look at the design because we have to decide this
yeah
yes
well we have a power button guys
guys we have a power button setting buttons l c d  window the number buttons
uh
yes
uh the mute button i h love that one
yes
yeah yeah yeah yeah well that's that's also design
yes
um
well h ho
yes yes they are for some uh video uh

apart
so people have to move their hand and they get less uh complaints of r s i 

that's what i always do because all my i important buttons are the same place
yes
well not
yes
uh huh
up and down far apart from each other
well not too much
well for example the power button you can if someone is constantly z zapping it's not going to miss that it that the power button is not right beside it because i have someone but the buttons is way so that one can be put away
the power button can uh be uh uh

yes oh man five minutes
yeah well five minutes left yep
um how are we going to do it with those numbers
well i have it here
yeah well that's going to take too too much time yes
yes
well the l c d  um you are industrial you are user interface so i think it's going to go to mike but you will have to make consensus with well
well it's a bit hard because we are going to be uh individually that's a bit uh
yes
yes it is
well what if we're going to now decide about the functions and the design comes into the next round
plus the d th the design round is still to come huh
alright these functions the number f well yes that's alright w the number function are we going to uh do it like uh on mike's screen with uh one button that says i'm going to do a t two number digital
how do you want it to do then
it it has to r recognise one as there could still come more
yes
alright so no button for that
okay uh anyone any uh oth other functionalities of our uh remote
so
no we'd uh just said we didn't uh
well uh
um well because we can't integrate it with any other uh remotes all those buttons on those pictures are uh irrelevant so just for a television is that all we need
teletext is gone so all those buttons that ar are to do with teletext oh screen placing
we'll have uh those uh buttons about uh
and uh the two important ones we're l f forgetting uh there's um screen you can make it wider and less wide and the button that you can go to a v  for your video
those two but it's just two and we make a clip
th that's a bit uh waste
yes
or at the top your l c d  screen is going to go
yes
yeah
well i think they should in an in an isolated part of the remote
yes yes yes well any other uh
go to video that's always on your remote control to a v  uh to a v  a v  a v 
well l n no not at not at my remote
yeah
yes
i don't i go to ninety nine
th that's the button uh no
no you can ch push zero yeah yeah i i think that one button is uh i use it uh
yeah
these buttons i don't have buttons for channel setting uh especially on my remote
it's it's incorporated with p m plus and down uh those

so we still have one uh four
ch ch
okay oh the okay button oh you always have in the centre an okay button for your menu menu button
channel setting menu we have to go
okay
so um save
yes see
yes i have put it in
here

alright
guys we're going to uh go to our uh rooms and uh we'll have to decide s things on our own i think so

well see you uh w w we have lunchtime by the way now uh so uh
lunch
ah we didn't exactly do everything but so



mm
oh
oh
oh that's a shame

yeah
yeah
mm


yeah
yeah


no
i don't think
yeah
yes you should you should could take a look at it and and and know how it how it's supposed to work
yeah but nobody reads a manual about a remote control i think
yeah right it sh it should be there the manual but but not to explain how the remote works only
hmm


no


i think that's uh difficult to realise also

no and we have customers in multiple uh countries i think
yeah
no
oh you go

yeah go ahead



high tech
you can also like
yeah i was thinking you can

are some of the the the um
maybe you can make for for channel changing two little buttons on the side of the remote so you can just do like this like some uh little uh gameboy things or some hmm
well
yeah alright but
yeah but if you s say them up and down they they'll understand it i think eighty per cent would
yeah that's true
yeah but

mm
well i thought um everybody on the website uh would see the same thing but
obviously that's not the case
yeah
for instance you couldn't see this
um
yeah well i'm mike user interface designer
the the method well
i used my own experience with remotes took a good l look uh at the remotes on the corporate website which are these two um
yes these are from from another uh manufacturer um
this one is engineering centred so this one has the most functions and um things this one is user centred
um
i like user centr centred uh uh also the best
um
well i thought uh that we uh reduce the the option to control the d v d  also and teletext and that kind of stuff
uh so i thought we we we would use more or need more buttons than this one but
yes th that's why this mm is not relevant any more i feel um
i think this is about the maximum number of buttons uh we'll need
i um i kinda like the shape i think this is what we talked about but
no i've well i showed it somewhere um
oh yeah i think we should go further with the idea of a removable front so we can can uh yeah customise the
mm
yeah it's a front it's not the the whole remote that changes of course you can
mm
or you can you can can put the same symbol on on every remote so l like ericsson does every uh
s something like this it's recognisable
um
yeah
yeah yeah something like that in the yeah
yeah
um well so uh uh like i said i thought we'd we'd use more function if we we had to include more functions but we don't so um
yeah i think this is about the maximum number of buttons we need maybe some less like eject we don't need and some other buttons we don't need i think uh
yeah i will i think uh for the remote um uh less is more the less buttons the better the design um
we should go with that concept i think
i know
mm
yeah but what kind of features like l c d  screens and voice recognition but i've

yeah that's nice
yeah we should keep that simple too it will
no it should be uh integrated i think
yeah something like on um some radios in car you where it's yeah walking to yeah
wa yeah

yeah well we we we still need to know how much that will cost
or maybe you will get that information uh yeah
at the top or at the bottom
yeah but
yeah but with with the l c d  screen on the top it gets a bit unnatural 'cause most remotes have some space left at the bottom
yeah no mm
uh well because most uh remotes have um some space left at the bottom and that way you can keep the shape recognisable for everybody i c
well i d i think that's that's ugly but
i th
yeah power button always yeah
yeah
yeah y you gotta zap like this or you want to yeah
yeah you don't want you want uh yeah it it it must be a remote
yeah


at the bottom in a few minutes oh yeah oh yeah i totally agree yeah

he's the boss
no it's our job for all of us i think
the ten numbers yeah
volume
i think we we should use something like this um to um
the the channel up and channel down button yeah in circle you know
and and a volume control also in it
yes as i already said we could drop some of these buttons
yeah
i think these should be in one big circle in the middle

yeah but people don't like it when their buttons are all over the place they they need to be centred
volume hardly
no i don't think
yeah but
yeah but no
the other the other two uh frustrations are far more important so
well they are used four times an hour so
power bu button should be left at the top
mm yeah

well consensus um we we can put it in the middle so
alright
no
well just when you push a one one and
no if you on most t v s if you uh press two numbers shortly after each other d it yeah yeah yeah
yeah

yeah
we we can make make uh a little row of like four buttons down here
or at yeah alright then
oh they can be small or round like buttons
why go to video
that's just zero yeah

yeah but you can can zap down
yes i think th
no then you press ninety nine i think go to video is
an irrelevant button but

yeah well y you must have
yeah you yeah you have one one button from s set frequency o or something and then with plus and min minus you can uh adjust the uh
yeah alright
i think things like uh contrast and brightness should be um in the menu yeah
yeah the
or the volume or something like that
your pen
i thought we'd uh lunch uh right now or not
yeah lunch break
mm
well yeah
no
oh
we have forty minutes for this uh discussion
alright
huh
yeah
mm hmm now it's right
it's meant to be easily wiped out yeah
mm hmm
i i disagree but uh it's not uh t it's not my place to disagree i guess
oh alright
yeah we are a real fashionable company i read uh i read it on the i didn't know what company
we were but we we design uh especially trendy uh trendy trendy stuff so it has to be uh
a modern design that's important to know uh when you design a thing of course
yeah

the order no
you can zap away yeah

oh
oh

mm hmm
i think our uh user uh expert should also consider manual a manual for the remote of course uh
i didn't read it oh alright users to uh add one do you think
mm hmm yeah alright because they don't use it alright
well maybe for the if you don't recognise a button who d who d who do i call uh wh when i don't know it
isn't it part of the of the u no no never mind
consider the m
yeah
mm hmm
it's going to be expensive yeah
well we'll uh consider it uh
we'll think abo we'll think
no we'll look we'll look into that later alright
we have very demanding clients
yeah yeah alright well we'll consider both and and see what uh what what we can find i think we don't rule them out uh yet
shall i give a technical talk alright
well uh it is my task to uh explain uh or to point out a working design
we have that here okay how do you enlarge it so that you can have the f  f  five
yep well the working design that's my uh
well alright uh you know who i am and what i do so uh we have this it's a bit uh unclear because i wanted to
copy paste something it was originally in black and white but it became black and purple but i think you can read it
um well um i think it's important uh for you to realise the basic function of a remote control
uh well you can see uh

and i then can select i can select on the dings it goes to the next page
well you can read it it's not too difficult meanwhile this is a schematic uh um view of uh
how a basic remote control works you have uh basically uh the energy the power of the
of the remote control uh and the sender w which is the led the
the the the the the the the the bulb that sends the the infrared beam to the no to the set
and uh the source is of course the user uh the user interface is um uh the
the the buttons of course and the the user interface sends uh the the different
signals of the different buttons to the chip and the chip uh sends it to the led and the led sends it to the receiver that's the that's
the basic idea very basic
um well i have uh uh put it in a
in in in a a couple of basic steps uh the remote uh is basically just waiting for a
user to press a key it does nothing until uh of course uh the key is pressed
the key a signal to a chip uh the chip senses the connection uh and recognise the key so
well you understand the chip uh produces morse code um a specific code to indicate that specific
button that is pressed of course and it uses transistors in the in the remote control to amplify and to send
uh that signal again to the to the led which is the bulb of course
now the led produces an infrared beam and signals the well it's uh very simple and signals the uh signals to the sensor on the t v  set and the t v  set uh also recognises the the the signal and performs the assigned task
ah bu yeah but we don't uh we no no but yeah exactly uh well this is uh
the basic uh function of a remote i've some couple of pictures here it's a very basic one
and uh if we if we're going to add an uh an uh l c d  screen to it it uh won't look anything like this
but
this is very basic uh basically the the shape of um of a remote control it has uh very little buttons and
but it it uh it's it's quite um yeah you can easily recognise the buttons they're
uh far enough apart and an anything it's not very um
uh not very high tech uh indeed and it's not very user friendly uh if you look at the shape it's uh just a
simple long box uh shape so we have to uh change a little bit uh to that uh so that
uh it becomes more user friendly and that uh problems like uh r s i  and uh those kinds of thing don't don't oc
don't occur yeah
mm hmm
yeah because they are the the most important buttons and you can immediately
you don't have to look and and search for them
well you you can't have any uh every button under the thumb of course
yeah
well
but in e in any case the the basic function should be uh indeed and as you say at the thumb i think that's a good idea and uh
and that the less important uh buttons like the the the different channels uh the numbers one two three four five as well should be uh
yeah well not in reach because uh they don't use it uh all the time
well it's uh pretty pretty basically uh as you said and i have some pictures of the inside workings but uh i don't want to get too technical because uh that's not uh very uh useful for you
so yeah exactly this is uh how it uh looks from the inside and uh well that's about it i think oh yeah i still have this oh i had to delete this but i had to make a schematic uh of the of the new but i had too too little time but uh don't uh
don't look at it please i i think it's it's clear uh how it works alright that's the most important thing
alright uh
right
yeah uh there are different uh we have all have different home pages with different links yeah
mm hmm
you can't really see uh the differ from different sides but i think uh
uh you can draw it if you yeah
we can put it on the on the back side
yeah so that you don't replace the symbol yeah
mm hmm
mike uh can you put uh that picture from me on the in the word documents file in map
the younger uh
mm hmm
mm hmm i think uh the most functions uh underneath that uh uh no um mm usually
but
yeah i think m most
most uh
mm hmm uh
yeah our competitor yeah
yeah
yeah so it it just signals the the different uh sig uh the different symbols
on the screen you have uh because if you change to s channel two you have two on the screen and two on your on your um
on your l c d  screen
but should it uh really be uh clickable uh or or just integrate inside to try to make it d more trendy
but that's of course uh a bit more uh expensive than uh the basic uh calculator design with the scrolling text and that kind of thing
alright
shouldn't we start with the most important parts the l c d  screen alright but we should start with the power button uh
huh
and then uh
maybe we should uh centralise the discussion here i dunno what uh you were talking about but
we are busy with something
uh huh why do you think it's better at the bottom
but you just can put uh the the the the the whole interface a bit down so that there's room for the for the interface
uh huh
and and we can
bottom
well that's a bit exaggerated well i agree with you
it's it's also more recognisable it looks more like a calculator to people if you have the l the the
the thing on top
yeah w well but uh you don't have to throw uh um important aspe important aspect like familiarity uh completely away uh because i think it's uh
i think it's still important to have it at the top because it's uh
it's more familiar that way
a little a little bit
maybe you should another pen maybe that's uh better
you e you only have one pen for that screen yeah
yeah i i agree
well i'm the i i'm the designer so um
yeah
uh we uh we were busy with that uh yeah we should uh summon the the different uh aspects of the thing so we have the power button
yeah of course uh it's uh yeah w wh
while you have to agree i can say it's like this and you must agree yeah
channel yeah
volume control
um
well let's look at your uh design uh
uh huh
yeah but th th on this remote th these controls are for something else a d v d  player or something so
yeah it's it's also not good to completely stay in one position constantly with one hand y yeah it's good to move uh from time to time yeah
no but now y w would we have to choose a
way in middle

mm hmm
oh far apart
i think you can have the two buttons of up and down close together but you don't have uh have to have volume control and and zapping button close together
yeah
c c can you make you make we can use uh the drawing board now i think uh it it doesn't work well but but it it would be pretty pretty uh nice if we could just draw a simple thing
mm alright
well uh yeah i i still think it's it's quite important though to uh to have it at the top so yeah you say familiarity isn't important but
yeah d
yeah
as we we we we agreed we do have a l c d  so that's
that's enough yeah
there's one two three four five six six seven eight nine zero
oh like that um
they'd recognise it th that's the most that that's very easy yeah
i think these are the the most important functions
basic function
oh yeah
uh just two just two under uh under uh
i i think uh
but you you can put uh two or three buttons under uh another section uh that's that's too complicated you can just put it somewhere they they aren't used much not as much as those other so you can put it somewhere
yeah s bit smaller and s well uh and and i think more at the bottom yeah
yeah or at the top yeah what do you think uh those those buttons above or down
and w where well we design it later we have it and we design later where everything goes yeah
the the video channel uh
no no not always ze yeah zero is a different channel than uh the the video channel
but it's easy to go if you are at uh at channel uh fifty five and you want to uh go immediately to the video channel you do you have to push a to to get below zero it's more easy to get to uh where the specific uh video channel button
yeah well uh d different screen settings a yeah sk yeah y you you you you have screen width
yeah to uh oh yeah of course to configure the programme the yeah
yeah
you should yeah i think that's important uh and and the settings to change the brightness the settings to change the brightness and the contrast
channel yeah
chief
chief
th the menu menu button is also important then you can uh
where i don't see it oh menu alright
in the menu and you can uh then adjust it with the zapping buttons or something because uh the zapping buttons aren't used then if you are in the menu yeah or the volume yeah
yes chief
yeah this is this is your thing
i am hungry
see you later mate
great man who starts
alright great
alright
mm hmm
yes
'kay
yeah
no you're the only one
alright
'kay
alright
right

yeah
okay
okay

alright
yeah
but let's forget about it it's just time consuming so we uh have to go on
yes
mm

right
yeah
yeah i think i have to start oh no no problem i i just have to uh to think which file's mine 'cause i was uh bit in a hurry
i think it's this one
but i'm not sure

hmm yeah s
right
yes this is it well i'm going to tell you something about functional requirements um to start with these points uh next sheet
um at first i tell you something about what people dislike about the current uh controls because it's uh a smart thing to exclude those things uh furthermore it's very important what they do like and what they do use
um then i tell something about um the most important issues so we have to focus
on those three thing three things and in the end i'll um show you our target
audience or our target product users customers
well um the first findings are that people um
think most controls are very kind of ug ugly
that's seventy five per cent of the current users they don't like it so we might think about fronts in that section um
they also say that's about uh i thought it was fifty per cent uh that more money will be spent on uh better looking controls so it's very important that you design a a nice looking control
um the current user uses his machine just about
well all of the time for a few functions uh almost every user uses it d
the the control for just ten per cent of its capacity so it's really important to
make the the buttons for the common uh tasks kind of big or kind of uh flashy
furthermore it's uh seventy five per cent of the users uh zaps a lot thus it might be uh might be smart to make a a big uh zapping button or something in the middle so you can reach it with your thumb yeah yeah right
right
a lot of losers um users lose their controls in their in their living
room so it might be sensible to make some kind of a button on your television that's your
um your control beeps or something that you can find this very easily i dunno maybe that's an idea
'cause it's uh a big i think fifty per cent of the users loses his its
control within the same room so
yeah but what if you lose your click on device
yeah but if someone d somebody else uses it in ano other room or something
nee but it it specifically says it's uh the the control is lost in the same room
so
well a beeping device would be uh furthermore the learning time is a problem uh thirty four
thirty four per cent um thinks it's it's too uh too difficult to learn
so the the learning curve should be very short uh for the dumbest people should be able to use it
yeah but people don't read manuals
no
i think you should put more time in the in the design of uh pick up and use than a manual
yeah right
and it should be consistent with consistent with older remotes
alright
and we don't have much time so it's better to uh put our attention to the the design so you can pick up and use it than i think
yeah right right
next point um r s i  well that's about twenty per cent
i thought but uh the designer should uh take it uh
should uh wie zeg ik dat yeah consider the consequences of using your remote it should be a good in
your hand
right this is the most important part um we're like the requirements said we're gonna specify
of we're gonna target a younger audience um that's about sixty per cent of the market
so it's uh quite important um research shows that they like to have a little l c d  screen
on their on their uh zapping uh device uh
i thought it was the age between sixteen and twenty ninety nine per cent of uh the people like that so it's very important we should definitely have that in our uh designs
yeah but they think it's really important so if we want to s if we have a big
if we make lots of uh of the stuff maybe we can uh buy it very cheap i dunno we have to uh
yeah i don't know i don't have any information on that so
right and uh another thing is uh speech uh recognition they also like that but research is very uh costly so
yeah but
it it might be important for the sale
well i do think l c d  is more reachable than the speech recognition so we might consider l c d  screens
alright
alright um i think that's it um
i think
it is sensible
to u uh to take this take these points into the notes so you can right
yeah right
alright next button
oh right
purple
yeah yeah yeah a bit
maybe you can select it so it uh inverts
the p the whole picture nah uh never mind
yeah
alright


right
can i say something um i have a table here about uh the l the relevance of the buttons
uh the power button is used very much channel selection volume and teletext well teletext
is not an option so that uh but i think it's very important to make um the power channel and volume
buttons uh near to the thumb so you can't have r s i  uh consequences
right make them big make them easy to uh to press
right
yeah right right
yeah that's right that's right that's right we
but
yeah that's very important and
but is that is that useable do people uh when they pick up a remote know that they have to do that
it's a f it's a new feature you can make make a double feature l like a button on the top and under it
yeah he feels it immediately yeah that's right yeah
right continue sorry
yeah that's right
alright

alright
yeah it's clear
i dunno i think uh w
about twenty minutes ago
losing time losing time
yeah right so
i don't think so
yeah right
these are already in use
alright okay
well yeah me too
mm
but we have to reject that because of the requirements
alright
yeah right
yeah
but it
yeah that's right
yeah that's a must we must have that
we can make a symbol of the company right here and if you put a front on it there's a hole on the front so the symbol's always on yeah
yeah yeah but let's not focus on the front
alright
yeah i agree
i've i've got another point um there are two target audi audiences and we've uh chose for
the younger one um research has shown that um it's a high interested uh
in features they are high high interested in feature but they are more critical fo yeah
critical so the younger audience so we must um must design
uh a control that really speaks to the people
mm hmm
clip aren't used much
yeah right
yeah but yeah
here look at these numbers the newest features are like i said are uh l c d  and uh speech uh control
our audience these people are very like these uh features
you see so we must build in something or they will to uh go to the concurrent
the concurrent competitors right so i do think we have to uh
have some features
even though they cost a little more
right right
like a ticker tape which programme you are l watching or something
yeah right yeah right
no not clickable nah no no no yeah just at at the top so when you s you sit like this you can can watch i think it should be at the top
yeah right it's a ticker tape idea
well it's just one script
yeah five minutes of ja ja for programming so i don't think that's the issue
alright we go with the l c d  screen
'kay
right i don't know if i can find that but
next time yeah right
yeah i understand what you're saying
we should have a general idea of how it's gonna look
right
at the top
i think the top is more uh
when you s how do you zap you just sit in your chair
with the remote
yeah but that's where your hand ball might be yeah i dunno
we'll draw two and then we'll see uh
no um he thinks yeah right he thinks it's better to put the l c d  at the bottom and i think it's better at the top
but your
yeah the the ticker the l c d  is like like small it's it's wide it's not not high but
yeah right but
we're making a remote with with a few functions you know we

high tech

width
th that's not a problem when i draw here it oh huh
yeah it's off
it it needs to be calibrated again well
where
alright we have to make a decision now because we don't have much time um
i think we have uh a few functions and we can put uh the l c d  above it and still have lots of room at the bottom where you can put your hand
at the bot
so
we are two uh v s  two
right great
and moreover i think that you two should be uh come to consensus about the l c d  s it's uh your it's your job
yeah right
alright let's keep it central
mm

right
you should put that uh power button channel and volume should have the most uh importance
yeah but what he said about r s i 
was t kinda true when when you uh put
them all in the same place the most used buttons you're doing the same thing all
the time and that's just what r s i 's all about so it might be smarter to put them
a little more away from each other
um
frequency of uh button use um channels are uh most uh
is most used within the hour you can see so the the channel
uh channel buttons should be far far apart i think up and down
you thinking uh about r s i 
y look at uh look at the frequency nei not too much but
nei nei nei n i i totally agree but just
yeah right
yeah i agree
and should and should be red
right just make some decisions
the most important things we have to uh
i do think you have to keep you have to keep it central now just uh you decide that you decide that and ready
yeah
nei we're no we're deciding now so
top or bottom
okay
yeah right okay
yeah okay
no
do you still have the pictures over there
yeah that's about it
you do need the uh multi or did uh no like this one you do need them yeah i know but are we
alright alright uh now okay
right
yeah it's most useable this way


yeah
right i do think we have to put that underneath a clip

yeah okay right
well if you you take those th if you
yeah but you can z you can zap t you can you can zap to the video channel from zero to uh
yeah but when you zap down zero you get to a v 
ah uh well whatever
yeah but if we're choosing to uh incorporate these buttons you have to have uh channel setting if you wa if you have a new t v  you have to set the channels right all th these uh different buttons you have to
ah i do
right that's the only one we put uh in there
for a screen uh fu uh channel setting
programme right
uh


ah great
alright
ah okay
get into my belly
mm hmm
okay
ooh
hmm

how do we sta wa how do we start
does anybody know
so that's this
oh okay right
uh

hmm
okay just hang on a second everybody i haven't actually looked at this yet
um
i haven't looked at it but let's just start it off and we'll see what happens
if you're all ready
so is the agenda opening acquaintance tool training and project plan discussion and then closing
project aim is a new remote control it's original uh trendy
and it's user friendly project method functional design
individual work another meeting conceptual design individual work and a meeting
of details design individual work and a meeting
tool training
try out the whiteboard every participant should draw their favourite animal and sum up their favourite characteristics of that animal
um
uh miss industrial designer would you like to go first
yeah why don't you just c i think just clip on clip do you have a belt
or put 'em in your pocket yeah
yeah what's your favourite animal
is it rude
that's a very good elephant
'kay and you want to write up on there it says you've gotta sum up your f f your favourite characteristics of that animal
mm
okay wonderful well done do you want to use the wipe the m the wiper and wipe it off
and mister aesthetics designer do you wanna go next
no

no
okay well done
yeah miss mar miss marketing
um yeah i think you can just draw the face but then you'll have to describe in writing how the rest of it looks
that's a very pr pretty cat
okay do y do you wanna do some write you wanna just write some words about it
wow so they're kinda spiritual
well done
okay
um i don't actually have a favourite animal but for the for th for this meeting i'll s draw a little
uh
i honestly can't draw for toffee uh
yeah
no no uh
that's exactly what it is uh not a very good one

okay well you got it's a s
it's a squirrel and i like them because they're cute
and stupid
right okay so i guess that was the test to see if this equipment is all working
mm let's move on to the next page
okay project finance selling price twenty five euros profit aim
fifty million euros
yeah production cost ah right it's gotta be can't cost any more than twelve fifty to make
experience with with remote control so talk about who who's used what any ideas
stuff like that
next meeting starts in thirty minutes
at quarter to twelve

yeah
oh k so we're actually supposed to be doing this discussion like right now are we or oh okay i thought this was just t giving us instructions for the re to do next but
okay right who's got experiences with remote controls then
pretty much everybody
um
'kay um
w what
you want it big do you want it small
are we are we going for like like telephones are going little teeny tiny things or we are going for something that's that's big and
video and ts hi fi and stuff
maybe you yeah now th that's the other thing is it's gotta be cheap
'cause i i i mean i was thinking something that's got different like maybe a a an l c d  display on it that's got different pages for different devices
but that would p that would probably be quite expensive
per unit yeah
well at the moment we could wa i mean we 'cause we this is what we th what we're doing at the moment is just saying what what we'd like and then after
we after we've found out what we can like some different ideas we can then go and do the research to find out if
these any of these ideas are feasible or not so would be nice to have something that that controls
lots of different things
um
'kay
okay that's
th that's an idea
okay
one side for kids one side for adults
like it or something like a flip telephone something like that maybe
f flip it open and you've got all the buttons or you flip it closed and you've just got the basic buttons on the outside maybe
um oh we've got five minutes left
but okay
well we've got a k we've got a few ideas there
yeah
i have got i think we should also have a back up plan of i 'cause i i i just think that it might be expensive
to make something that i mean we don't we haven't been told it has to be something that will control everything we
should have a back up plan of just a really good television remote control that just that is just for a t v 
but it's just a really good nice one
what do you reckon
see 'cause i'm just thinking bearing in mind th we've gotta we have to have something that's cheap to make
i think we'll be able to come up with ideas and stuff a lot quicker
yeah
may w you know maybe even
or maybe even so something that's for disabled people or so people that uh b don't see very well or big buttons for touchy buttons for
yeah
or just one that looks really fucking cool

otherwise we'll be we'll be here all day talking about do this let's do that n i think we sh i think we should
yeah i mean obviously everyone we're uh you know uh sounds like we're all a bit sort of gadget heads and we like things that do everything at once but you know that's
yeah
yeah that's right yeah i mean i'd like one that makes tea as well but that's not gonna happen
okay like a lock f like a lock functs function on it like you have on your telephones yeah
yeah it's gotta be sellable yeah
yeah

okay
no porn channel for children okay um alright so we've got some ideas we've got um
let's move on
oops let's close that next meeting uh okay
industrial designer um which is
um
yeah there you go so
user interface designer that's that's that's you so you gotta you go you're you're gonna be the one that's working out what what buttons we need um
industrial designer you are the one you know you're gonna be working out kind of box it goes in i guess so um
whether it's what goes into the box somehow
and in marketing
user requirements specifications
yeah what
right okay yeah
you two you two are gonna be just i think you just double up you know you working together
you're the one that's gotta go and find out do th do the research see what people want in a remote what buttons are used more often and s stuff like that
oh we've been warned to finish the meeting now okay
okay everyone well done good meeting
yeah
so we're 'kay on the or
no i dunno where to put it 'cause the
okay could you s take it off
okay

are we free to take notes uh
okay
okay
so are we supposed to bring the little things for the
mm
yeah okay so my favourite animal
'kay um
um okay it's big it's got a great memory
supposed to have a great memory we say an elephant never forgets and uh dunno know why but looks like nice to me nice animal
okay

no

really oh that's a

not bad i would say
very good
mm
yeah
is this a t v  one we are supposed to make
okay
t
but how do we know how much uh i mean how much do we have per how much twelve fifty
so do we have to be realistic within the budget or
close pr i don't know how much it would cost yeah
right
yeah
um have uh one very complicated one on one side with all the d v d  and
v c r  access and stuff and then on the other side o one uh a remote control that
would be very very simple with just the channel program plus and minus and the just the mute button for example
i can real keep it really really simple on one side and the other side be very complicated
yeah or grandma as well you know it's like what is the mute button
no but you would slide it into uh someth like something on the back would hold like you wouldn't be able to press the buttons but
start breaking up
yeah
yeah

could be really light or i dunno something special
yeah 'cause at the end of the day if it says just t v  remote doesn't say com combination with all all the r



mm


okay
that's
mm
mm har how it works an
bu
do you think our two kind of overlap because
yeah

i don't

yeah

the back end of an elephant
aesthetic yep sure
'kay my favourite animal uh let's see
dunno if any of you have seen napoleon dynamite before it's a liger
a combination of a lion and tiger have you not seen napoleon dynamite
oh it's a hilarious movie you have to see it and
and it's best characteristic is it's pretty much
the awesomest
animal
but you have to see the movie to fully appreciate it
there go


a prairie dog oh a squirrel

yeah that's pretty good

alright
so i think before we close uh we are expected i mean the last slide wanted us to maybe discuss longer what our
what our ideas where i mean if you wanna go back to the last slide uh
s
yeah i think we're i mean before we close the meeting we're supposed to come up with some ideas for
yeah
yeah
yeah i think this is just the preliminary get some rough ideas for what our experiences with remote controls have been and and what we would
roughly what we would incorporate into a new one maybe
yeah i think we've all got
mm
yeah it seems like there's like there's sort of a tension between two ideas i mean you want you want one remote
that maybe can work uh all all of the functions of t v  and if you have whatever associated with t v  the d v d 
player or something like that but like at the same time you don't wanna really busy remote with
a thousand buttons on it or something
mm
yeah
it g can't be more than twelve fifty per unit
cost
yeah

yeah
i'm not sure if that's like
i'm not sure if it's a good idea to have a two sided remote though 'cause it would be very hard to use in the way that you mani manipulate it
oh
oh okay
yeah
okay
mm hmm
yeah we should uh i guess by the end of this meeting we should have at least a a rough conception you know
stage one was technical functions design what effect the apparatus should have okay um
so i mean we still have time in our next meeting to come up with the actual concept for the user interface but the the functions that we're sure that we want
are that it can control the t v  but also devices connected to the to the t v  i mean be
able to operate
d v d  players things like that
yeah
okay
right
yeah i mean
yeah that's true maybe we should just concentrate on having a a good t v  remote and have it be um
have it be like ergonomic so it's comfortable to use uh simple to use and looks decent and
sorta find a niche for our remote like market it to a certain kind of p kind of people
certain certain demographic

yeah no i think you're right
yeah rathe rather than focus on
y
yeah
yeah
remotes spinning out from other remotes and having little nested remotes inside
yeah that's true what you were saying i mean it doesn't have to have a flip function it can just have a lock function so that it's not uh not usable when you don't want it to be usable

i guess that's good good for now
that's me okay
right right
yeah it does seem like our our responsibilities have some overlap
yeah

alright see you in thirty minutes

is that alright
or
okay
keeps coming off 's fiddly

right
oh another one
ah
very nice
'kay
okay

clip
ah
it's an elephant
oh my gosh i'm never gonna be able to draw that well
does it oh
mm
i have no idea what my favourite animal is

oh
it's
a what
alright
how
no
great
me
okay
not quite sure how this is gonna work
cool uh well i'll try my best to draw
can i just draw the face
ooh
it's a cat which also has what a big fat body and
big and a long tail
why because um cuddly
and usually cats are very friendly usually
and they're healing as well they heal and they can feel when a human's got problems so
so that's why i like cats
there we are that's me


mm

mm hmm

ah

market range internationally sold
ah right okay
yeah
yeah
uh
yeah yeah it's a t v  remote control
well
a new remote control for t v 
what would i like um
medium

mm
twelve fifty
each
guess
couldn't we have like one that comes out
like so you have one in like mm it doesn't have to be really thick i mean remote controls can be thin
bits and then you have one for your d v d  and you sort of slide it out and then you have another one you slide it out
have slides and then it all comes compact
into one so it's not you actually just putting three or four different remotes together but making them thinner and um into one basically
so you just flip them out
that would be cool i was thinking that like a flip
okay um
but what'll make it what'll make it interesting for people to buy though i mean if it's if it's just like
mm hmm

mm
i think a flip up thing 'cause you always have this problem of like if it's on this well i did anyway like we had five
or six remotes and they would be lying on the c on the coach and you'd come and sit down and ooh the telephone's the television switched
on or something so maybe something that like
does have a lid or closes so you don't accidentally press a button or record button for something
yeah
but make it like really snazzy and cool people will want it so make it yeah
yeah
mm
yeah
and even for kids as well it's um it's safer for them i guess like they don't flick onto
channels and all that sl flick onto

mm
w what does i d v i d n m e  stand for
ah ri okay these are requirement specification
and i'm marketing
these are requirement specification
so what the user requires
in a remote
i guess that's what it says
mm
so do we take these off
