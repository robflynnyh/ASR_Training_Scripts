{"text": "hey andrew hi and thanks for the question", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 1.52}
{"text": "so on the sales and marketing cost that kjell was saying we of course um you know need to look at where we are in the fourth quarter against early in the year also from a you know return to normality point of view and that of course brings you um in general to a little bit of a normalized level also on your marketing and sales cost", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 18.2}

{"text": "um but within that the fourth quarter is a higher cost quarter and i'm", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 5.580041666666666}
{"text": "and i also would like to point out that a lot of that commercial cost is driven by acquisition costs and not as much as marketing costs which i saw on some of the commentaries because we have of course also been able to get um some you know transformation savings on to our marketing spend by moving to uh one brand", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 19.000125}
{"text": "so uh there is a lot more related cost to volumes", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 4.160041666666666}

{"text": "say what you are seeing in the in the company at the moment does that give you confidence that um there is there is further you know costs uh or efficiencies to go after post the mid term um uh plan", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 13.600125}
{"text": "or do you then rely on operational gearing to to drive the growth forward", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 5.86}
{"text": "yeah that's also why we are reiterating our mid term guidance", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 3.2000416666666665}
{"text": "and there are", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 1.3000416666666668}
{"text": "i think we can say that there are cost savings", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 1.9000416666666666}
{"text": "there are cash savings", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 1.14}

{"text": "and also um is this informed um this plan informed by anything you see in the market actions by competitors or competitive um levels overall in the market", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 12.180166666666667}
{"text": "or is it simply going back to the drawing board you know putting together all the all the plans and sort of deciding it's it's it's better to sort of shift it out by six months", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 10.32}
{"text": "is it more internal or external", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 1.240125}
{"text": "that is the first question", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 2.620041666666667}
{"text": "and then the second question is um you mentioned during your prepared remarks that there was sort of a bit of a wave of contract expiration in the first quar in fourth quarter due to you know i suppose high sales in prior fourth quarters and then this contract sort of expired and created higher churn", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 17.559958333333334}
{"text": "was this", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 1.3200416666666666}
{"text": "how how do you see that right", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 1.140125}
{"text": "i mean that's generally you wo you would hope to not to see high churn when contracts ex expire", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 6.160041666666666}
{"text": "was this sort of a normal rate and just the higher underlying contract expiry", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 4.7800416666666665}
{"text": "or was there a reason why more people percentage wise of these expiring contracts decided to leave tele two or or or ask for for some better terms", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 10.820041666666667}
{"text": "thank you", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 0.4600416666666667}

{"text": "i will do the first one and hendrik will do the second one", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 2.919958333333333}
{"text": "so you are basically asking why do we shift to six months", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 2.7601666666666667}
{"text": "i i actually see that as uh a signal of strength in the business", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 3.8600416666666666}
{"text": "if we were not succeeding in the go to market then we would redouble the efforts on costs to try to compensate", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 7.660041666666666}
{"text": "the the thing here is that i see that both stefan and uh now hendrik has the opportunity to build sustainable growth and then it is easier to let them have a little bit of maneuvering space in the go to market", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 14.120125}
{"text": "so it is a decision that we have made internally based on how we think we can get the most value out of the approach", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 7.219916666666666}
{"text": "so if we see the see the opportunity like we do now to have sustainable growth it makes sense to give them a little bit more space and have", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 7.7400416666666665}
{"text": "uh do not be bogged down by too many freeze periods", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 2.780125}

{"text": "uh thanks for the question", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 1.6399166666666667}
{"text": "uh and on b two b then uh if you look at the comparison versus last year it is true that we have a a decline", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 9.760041666666666}
{"text": "um but if you look on the long uh trend we are decreasing that revenue or or aspu decline that we have seen in the b two b segment", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 8.419916666666667}
{"text": "um so uh looking at the efforts that we are doing uh keeping more disciplined around our pricing guidelines uh focusing on value uh and and making sure that we take a responsible stance in the market and we're challenging ourselves all the time to making sure that we get the right price from our b two b customers", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 27.16025}
{"text": "and we can see that is actually resulting in improvements", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 4.16025}
{"text": "uh if you compare to the q three and q four aspu uh it is a flat development", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 6.0601666666666665}
{"text": "uh and also if you look at the full year aspu uh we are on the same level as we were in both q three and q four", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 8.339958333333334}
{"text": "so i'd say the strategy uh is is uh yielding results and of course bringing in more sme customers with a higher aspu than the the key and the public sector", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 13.400041666666667}
{"text": "uh it works in the right direction for for us in b two b", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 4.999833333333333}

{"text": "yes stefan and stefan actually", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 1.5799166666666666}
{"text": "so um i will focus on the uh consumer side on the postpaid asked by stefan", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 5.320125}
{"text": "and and basically what you see from q three to q four is typically you know that in q three uh also this year actually still sort of in that um lighter touch on covid we did have some good roaming revenues as you may remember from our q three report", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 15.760166666666667}
{"text": "so that typically drives a higher you know aspu in the quarter which then of course you know coming out of the holiday season has an effect on the on the you know aspu in the fourth quarter", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 11.400041666666667}
{"text": "and that i think is the main the main explanation", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 2.319958333333333}
{"text": "if you look at the you know underlying aspu in the quarter versus last year we've been growing but by two percent and actually also versus full year you know strengthening the aspu uh development", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 9.780125}
{"text": "and and whilst you may think well you know from a campaigning there may be uh may be a little bit of a campaign uh low you know softer aspu uh coming into the mix", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 11.440041666666668}
{"text": "that of course to an extent is true but it doesn't have uh any effect on the overall you know customer base aspu as such", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 7.760125}
{"text": "so i would say it is mainly an effect from you know a strong q three driven by uh typically you know roaming and uh versus last year we see a a two percent growth in the quarter", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 11.16025}
{"text": "okay", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 4.679916666666666}

{"text": "thank you", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 1.0398333333333334}
{"text": "well um the wage inflation in sweden is pretty much determined by uh the central negotiations", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 11.119916666666667}

{"text": "uh and um there there is inflationary pressure in the baltics than in uh in sweden", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 8.619916666666667}
{"text": "now the good thing about that is that the business in the baltics is also pretty good at uh pricing their services", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 6.780166666666666}
{"text": "so uh i think the industry in general in europe has struggled with focusing on on this uh inflation adjustments of of pricing", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 9.800166666666666}

{"text": "um we have a quite unique position in european telecoms with our network cooperation with telenor", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 6.579916666666667}
{"text": "so we run uh some part of sweden on our own network but most of it through net four mobility", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 5.940041666666667}
{"text": "and that gives a a great advantage because we have the scale advantage and we have also very good spectrum a very good spectrum position", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 7.800166666666667}
{"text": "so when we when the whole two g three g four g market consolidates into one five g market that is actually a net positive for us at tele two because the combination of net four mobility on our home networks will mean that in terms of um base stations and spectrum we would have the strongest position in the markets", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 21.920041666666666}
{"text": "uh because right now we are operating with network corporations with sunab with telia we have net four mobility we have our own", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 8.000041666666666}

{"text": "okay thanks i know it's becoming more important towards the consumer you feel or is it because in the beginning you know people weren't so aware but now if you look sweden efficiency is is more of a divider in the marketplace", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 17.980166666666666}
{"text": "yeah i think we have a good four g network now", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 3.160041666666667}
{"text": "uh but the good news is that when we are moving over to the next technology and we can re plan the network we will be able to have better reach with fewer base stations because we are not sharing in in multiple relationships here", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 11.40025}

{"text": "um from my perspective today's results show the machine is kind of working", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 4.020166666666666}

{"text": "it's better to have a slightly smoother approach to to customer growth through the course of the year", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 4.780166666666666}
{"text": "or is it really just that you are kind of correcting for what was a very unusual first half uh last year", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 7.7000416666666665}
{"text": "and then i wondered", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 0.9600416666666667}
{"text": "um slightly following up on that previous question whether or on the question on capex um you begin you begun the big ramp up in spend", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 9.300125}

{"text": "uh and that is because a lot of people have worked hard on getting their data right", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 4.780125}
{"text": "one of the reasons why uh stefan is successful in b two b is that they do much better analysis now", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 5.420041666666667}
{"text": "there used to be", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 1.1199166666666667}
{"text": "b two b used to be very volume driven if you go back in time", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 3.0401666666666665}
{"text": "now they are much more accurate about the customer needs", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 2.9200416666666666}
{"text": "they have a much more interesting and relevant discussion with our big cu large customers and uh solutions customers", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 7.460041666666666}

{"text": "one of the things we wanna get out of our business transformation program beyond saving cost is that uh hendrik in cooperation with yogesh will work much more with big data be much more accurate in our go to markets", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 12.940041666666668}
{"text": "tele two has a history of being a very successful challenger", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 4.480041666666667}
{"text": "and that was great in a growing market and where you didn't have such a huge long tail", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 4.8799166666666665}
{"text": "now we are a converged fmc player", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 2.9199166666666665}
{"text": "we need to be much more accurate and that level of accuracy has increased a lot", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 4.619916666666667}
{"text": "and what hendrik brings to to the business here he brings many things", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 3.3000416666666665}
{"text": "but one of the things he brings is a deep understanding not only on mobile markets and not only of broadband markets but also the tv side of the business", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 9.639958333333333}
{"text": "so the whole picture comes together", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 1.9200416666666666}
{"text": "and and for us to be uh more surgical in our approach between value and volume we need more and bigger data", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 9.740041666666666}
{"text": "that's what we're getting into place", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 1.60025}
{"text": "that is one of the key things that is happening", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 2.839958333333333}
{"text": "and on on the rollout of the five g it's it's moving ahead", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 4.099916666666667}
{"text": "we actually were able to do a little bit more towards the end of the year than than we expected", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 4.720041666666667}
{"text": "so that that momentum has really picked up", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 3.519833333333333}
{"text": "so we think um a lot is gonna be built out in ' twenty two and that the main momentum will be done and finished by ' twenty three with of course some build outs in ' twenty four", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 10.540041666666667}
{"text": "so", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 0.2798333333333333}
{"text": "and the guidance for our capex you have it will be at the upper end clearly", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 5.020125}
{"text": "uh and but we we have transparency on that", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 3.0801666666666665}
{"text": "we have visibility on that", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 1.0398333333333334}
{"text": "uh it it's looking pretty good", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 4.599916666666667}
{"text": "that's pretty helpful", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 0.9400416666666667}
{"text": "thank you", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 0.42004166666666665}
{"text": "but if i could just follow up on that first question", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 1.9600416666666667}
{"text": "um in terms of the the staff requirement to become better and more capable with big data is tele two seen as a place where that is a a you know a great a great career option to be able to um have that opportunity", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 14.420041666666666}
{"text": "i'll start and then if you guys wanna chip in please", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 1.9800416666666667}
{"text": "um one of the things that i did after coming here was to move the big data resources out from being more of a staff function to being directly in the line of business", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 10.739833333333333}
{"text": "uh we have people here who are truly um capable and they are actually quite motivated now because they're much closer to where it happens", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 11.039958333333333}
{"text": "they're much closer to the business", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 2.1599166666666667}
{"text": "so so they they have really um quite a lot of energy in uh in putting into their work", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 6.680041666666667}
{"text": "uh and it seems like uh they're coming up with a with a big value add", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 6.220041666666667}
{"text": "and do you wanna add something guys", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 1.5198333333333334}
{"text": "now well from from a b two b perspective i would say that uh in the past in tele two we have underinvested in the business intelligence side", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 8.039833333333334}
{"text": "uh that is something that we are changing uh and and which we started already next year with the program in becoming more data driven and to to kjell's point in different manners of of running the business", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 15.640041666666667}
{"text": "uh we will continue to do that uh also this year", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 5.300125}
{"text": "uh and i think the cooperation that we have with with the units within our technical organization with the skillset that they bring uh the cooperation between the commercial and technical parts that will yield uh better control and better um uh performance and execution going forward in in in all aspects and not just commercial i would say but also from a customer experience perspective uh and a production perspective", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 30.680041666666668}
{"text": "so so really really looking forward to that", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 3.1199583333333334}
{"text": "thanks very much", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 2.1799583333333334}
{"text": "and maybe maybe adam just to add you know from a consumer point of view", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 4.440041666666667}
{"text": "i think you know customer value management you probably pick it up also as the operator is is really a way to go as you go into a converged strategy", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 8.800166666666666}
{"text": "um you know that is where we still have uh you know a lot of opportunity and mileage to go", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 5.88025}
{"text": "and uh as uh you know as kjell alluding to earlier the it transformation is quite essential to get that uh get that done so that we can really uh not just have the data but also act on it through you know how we build propositions how we you know get the intelligence to the channels and and et cetera", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 18.780166666666666}
{"text": "so you know we're we're in full motion of that um and uh there's clearly a lot of potential still to be", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 6.260041666666667}
{"text": "to come out of this as we go through two thousand and twenty two", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 1.4400416666666667}
{"text": "great thank you", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 3.2000416666666665}
{"text": "thank you", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 0.6800416666666667}
{"text": "and the last question comes from the line of abhilash mohapatra from berenberg bank", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 4.840125}
{"text": "please ask your question", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 3.2600416666666665}

{"text": "uh good morning and thank you for taking my question", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 2.86025}
{"text": "um i just wanted to come back to the comments around driving um improved top line growth in sweden please in context of the guidance", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 7.779958333333333}
{"text": "uh in twenty twenty one obviously you know group service revenue growth of one percent uh but all of that was driven by the baltics with sweden declining zero point five percent and q four actually softening a bit", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 11.040125}
{"text": "so just to confirm within the ' twenty two guide what are you assuming for sweden please", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 4.64025}

{"text": "well i can start", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 0.280125}
{"text": "uh first of all i think it's very important to see the trends overtime here", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 3.800125}
{"text": "so going from a a quite significant negative trend in in b two b to to to being a stable business was what we said we would do and and we've done it", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 9.960041666666667}
{"text": "so", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 0.2800416666666667}

{"text": "stefan and i and others will work hard to deliver meaningful growth there also", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 4.319833333333333}
{"text": "uh and then of course uh we've seen volumes picking up a bit in in consumer", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 6.480125}
{"text": "so our ambition is that all the the the main lines of the business meaning the baltics b two c sweden b two b sweden should should be delivering uh to the overall growth momentum of the company", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 13.440041666666668}
{"text": "and then and then of course it will it will vary over time where the biggest uh contribution comes from", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 7.440041666666667}
{"text": "clearly in the short term it will be be the baltics", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 3.2000416666666665}
{"text": "anything you wanna add or", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 1.080125}
{"text": "no i think you've put it well", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 2.0601666666666665}
{"text": "uh i mean during the year we've set some strategy for for b two b with specific cornerstones that that we shared with you uh at the capital markets day", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 9.299916666666666}
{"text": "we are delivering on on that strategy to the full extent and that's our focus and also to be consistent with regards to to to strategy and and these cornerstones with segmentation being a big subscription partner operational excellence et cetera", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 15.700041666666667}

{"text": "um i know you guys have been focusing us on the on the twenty eighteen analyst day and helping explain the differences and similarities as you pushed up to one point eight to two billion to next year but this year you've got revenues inline at four point eight with the the low end of that original plan but ebit um below by maybe a one hundred million at the low end of the plan", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 19.7401875}

{"text": "obviously we are seizing the commercial opportunities we are having", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 3.4400625}

{"text": "thank you for taking my question", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 2.1199375}
{"text": "um so my first one would be um just to go back on michael's question on the the ' twenty two guide", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 7.060125}
{"text": "um so your revenue uh guide for twenty twenty two um is is quite high um and so given that the mix is going to be not that strong it kind of implies uh a good step up in volume", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 17.1800625}
{"text": "um and so i was wondering if this is a correct assumption or if there is something else that will contribute meaningfully to the top line", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 7.1399375}
{"text": "because you mentioned that also in terms of uh some sponsorship is a little bit lower", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 4.1800625}
{"text": "so it seems like this good increase in revenues should come mostly from the from the from the volume growth", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 7.3399375}
{"text": "so i just wanted to check if that's uh the right way to think about it", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 4.6599375}
{"text": "um hi susy antonio speaking", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 2.4800625}
{"text": "your assumption is correct", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 1.519875}
{"text": "volume will be higher so we'll grow there", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 3.0000625}
{"text": "and this is because also the order book is significantly higher than we're used to and it's covering well into two thousand and twenty three", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 8.8201875}
{"text": "um it's not true that the the mix is weak", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 2.7200625}
{"text": "i mean actually the the the product range mix is high", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 4.760125}
{"text": "it's simply not enough improving compared to the loss of the of the monza and the introduction some some months later of the daytona", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 8.1600625}
{"text": "okay", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 2.1800625}
{"text": "but basically year over year volumes will be positive and mix we expect to be um slightly negative overall", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 8.519875}
{"text": "okay", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 0.220125}
{"text": "okay", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 0.2200625}
{"text": "got it", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 0.7200625}
{"text": "um and on pricing um so in ' twenty one it was the first time that you you pushed through a like for like price increase about two percent", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 10.320125}
{"text": "um if i remember correctly was mostly due to the inflation to the inflation", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 4.740125}
{"text": "um and given that the inflation for the moment is not really going away um should we expect something similar for ' twenty two", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 9.1}
{"text": "like are you planning to uh potentially push through some price increase if you know to offset the inflation or was it a one off in ' twenty one", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 9.060125}
{"text": "yeah", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 0.38025}
{"text": "this is an important point", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 1.6201875}
{"text": "i mean uh there is some pressure on the energy on the aluminum cost and we will uh and we will apply this price increase to consider for that but we will also leverage uh other important levers when it comes to the pricing of the new model and selected i mean the price increase of selected model and also the personalization", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 21.62}
{"text": "so this is an important factor we are factoring in uh susy", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 2.960125}
{"text": "okay very clear", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 1.2200625}
{"text": "and very quick just to follow up on your free cash flow uh that you", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 4.40025}
{"text": "so in the slide that you showed you basically you're in line you achieved the the two point four to two point eight cumulative uh cash flow as promised", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 9.1800625}
{"text": "so um", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 2.14}
{"text": "so basically the fact that um you were guiding previously to one point one billion to one point two five billion industrial free cash flow is just a matter of phasing right", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 10.539875}
{"text": "because it feels like um that has been just phased differently due to the to the phasing of the models", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 6.040125}
{"text": "yeah or was there some kind of advances for a future maybe hypercar which now been change in timing", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 5.64025}

{"text": "so is there a greater opportunity to you know take price explain it to your your customers if there's cost inflation to you um they are relatively sophisticated to offset that but then also to maybe you know help balance out the supply and demand um in the business", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 17.100125}
{"text": "it's a very high class problem but it seems like there might be a greater pricing opportunity um than you've ever even had before", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 5.6600625}

{"text": "and again as i said we will introduce also new model and we will apply in the right way the pricing", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 7.540125}
{"text": "so this is uh an important dimension that we are uh we are we are careful about also because uh we all know what is the pressure that there is in the supply chain all over the world", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 10.2000625}

{"text": "um does that mean that that car could potentially do the same type of volumes that uh attribute as they did in the past", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 7.8599375}

{"text": "the other element yes i think you are addressing the fact that the our customer base for this car is slightly younger and this is it is true", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 9.280125}
{"text": "i mean really you need to drive it to experience it", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 2.1}

{"text": "on the free cash flow for twenty twenty two um i really started to to bridge your guidance which feels very very conservative at the lower end at least", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 7.86025}
{"text": "i understand the step up in capex", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 1.5401875}
{"text": "i understand um that there are going to be higher taxes but um can you maybe help us help us with the amount of deposits that we should expect um from from the daytona and uh how many deposits did you receive last year for the competizione", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 13.100125}
{"text": "because it's really difficult to bridge the two numbers", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 2.5999375}
{"text": "well um i have not comment on the degree of conservatives of the estimate but basically our cash flow is really simple", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 7.82}
{"text": "i mean we have the ebitda and you know what the guidance is", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 3.520125}
{"text": "you know what we said about capex", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 2.4600625}
{"text": "i think your question is about the working capital where we include in the wider definition also the impact of the advances on the limited series cars", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 11.9400625}
{"text": "uh so the daytona we are talking about more than two hundred million more or less in in terms of current estimate", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 6.4800625}
{"text": "the other element you should not underestimate is the impact of taxes because we are obviously paying taxes both in terms of the balance and the advance on the basis of the results of two thousand and twenty one", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 13.740125}
{"text": "uh and it makes a big difference compared to what we paid in twenty twenty one based on the results of twenty twenty that were impacted by by the pandemic", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 9.2801875}
{"text": "hope this provides you uh a better understanding of the detail", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 4.1}
{"text": "yeah you're still benefiting from the button box right", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 3.780125}
{"text": "the button box is helping but not in terms of cash nor the level it did at the very beginning because now the the law provides for the benefit cash wise in three install in three year installments", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 12.7000625}
{"text": "so this has been already visible in twenty twenty one and it will be obviously in two thousand and twenty two", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 4.3601875}
{"text": "okay thank you", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 2.86025}

{"text": "good morning good afternoon everybody", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 1.0801875}
{"text": "uh my focus is on capex uh which is a portion of the lower free cash flow for the current year", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 8.2200625}
{"text": "so the eight hundred million may be considered a sort of peak for capex or should we expect they will go beyond one billion annually going forward", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 10.3201875}
{"text": "uh and when you talk about uh partnerships uh i remember you also mentioned partnership in order to reduce capex", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 8.3201875}
{"text": "i clearly understand you cannot talk about something that was not announced but uh just to elaborate a bit on on this in order to understand what could be the magnitude of the reduction in capex if any", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 12.62}

{"text": "thank you marco", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 1.0799375}

{"text": "the partnerships are an important way forward for us", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 3.3999375}
{"text": "and as i said also before uh there would be some uh partnership that uh is an important partnership for us we will announce in the near future", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 8.9800625}
{"text": "i i think that um i mean it's important", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 4.7200625}
{"text": "that is always also what i said in my previous life to keep strong discipline about capex and to keep the momentum and to to make sure to do something innovative", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 10.3001875}
{"text": "it's it's important we decide what we do internally and we decided and what we want to do with partners outside", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 9.2000625}
{"text": "so the two word are partnership and discipline", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 3.64025}
{"text": "and uh as i said in in the near future you will hear about an important partnership on something that is important for for our car but for which let's say we believe the the best way forward is is partnership", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 14.4200625}
{"text": "and on the amount of capex uh eight hundred million could be considered as a peak", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 5.220125}
{"text": "you you can consider it is more or less a a good number to think about because we will use as i said the the partnership to to optimize and to be disciplined", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 11.6}
{"text": "okay", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 0.580125}
{"text": "thank you", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 0.5601875}

{"text": "", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 2.4200625}
{"text": "yes", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 0.34025}
{"text": "it is a better result of the significant net order intake increase that we have seen this year", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 7.08}
{"text": "so we need to serve this one", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 1.800125}
{"text": "obviously we'll be very careful because the concept of remains crucial to our business model and this is an element of of significant attention", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 9.260125}
{"text": "we'll play all all leverages to to manage this one", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 3.6800625}

{"text": "will that have an impact expected in the first quarter of this year still", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 3.86}
{"text": "and secondly could you talk about the cadence of deliveries of the eight hundred and twelve competizione obviously a very high margin car for you in the quarter of twenty twenty two", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 7.6800625}

{"text": "however then the absolute number will not be uh as high as it has been during the last quarter of this year", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 8.40025}

{"text": "yeah", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 0.88}
{"text": "the the first question i had was um just on the volumes", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 4.039875}
{"text": "obviously you're now above eleven thousand units", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 3.060125}
{"text": "i think in the past uh previous management mentioned that max capacity was about fifteen thousand units on the existing industrial footprint", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 10.2200625}
{"text": "is is that still roughly the right number to think about", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 4.22}
{"text": "and in order to get there presumably you'd have to add shifts", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 3.8599375}
{"text": "what's the kind of lead time from a trading perspective to add incremental shifts", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 5.8799375}
{"text": "the second question i had was with respect to the carbon neutrality by two thousand and thirty", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 6.2000625}
{"text": "do you still expect e fuels to play a prominent role in reaching that target", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 6.320125}
{"text": "and then finally obviously we had significant management changes and some exciting promotions and external hires during the quarter um perhaps you could give some insights into the skill sets you were looking to promote as part of those management changes", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 15.04}

{"text": "so let's start from the management change", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 1.3401875}
{"text": "yes uh we did a big change at the beginning end of last year beginning of this change beginning of this year", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 7.58}
{"text": "and uh we did along two direction if you have seen", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 4.5601875}
{"text": "on one side we promoted our internal talents that i had the the pleasure to see because i talked to a lot of people in the company and those will externalize", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 10.7200625}
{"text": "i think uh what the common thread uh that we wanted and i wanted to push within this new organization are uh the four the four following ones", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 13.520125}
{"text": "number one the strong willingness to cooperate", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 5.8800625}
{"text": "number two is about uh attention to innovation", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 3.92}
{"text": "and number three is the focus to bring these things uh especially in a transition area to make the right the right choice the right decision with right timing and to move forward", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 11.8599375}
{"text": "and number number four is uh is very important especially nowadays this is becoming very important for all the companies is this continuous learning approach because we have uh to to be open to listen at the other point of view other people point of view and also the supplier point of view the partner point of view", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 20.1600625}
{"text": "so these are uh the features that i want to boost with the uh the new organization", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 7.220125}
{"text": "again organized with homegrown talents and also external hires", "audio_path": "Not used", "duration": 7.1199375}
